2025-03-14,1741965843.0,We need to stop bringing up the rape argument when debating forced birthers,"I feel like whenever we resort to the rape argument we are basically telling forced birthers 

""We get it elective abortions are wrong and icky but rape"" 

We need to hammer it home that elective reasons for abortion are just as important 

I can't help but feel we fall into the forced birther trap when we go ""but rape""

Because in the eyes of the forced birther it seems like a concession that elective abortions are wrong 

Not to mention we know forced birthers don't give a fuck about women 

They constantly dehumanize the pregnant woman in every argument they make

Trying to appeal to their emotions won't work since they don't even consider the pregnant woman an important aspect of this discussion 

Sure some may say the quiet part out loud, but if you have debated a forced birther you know the gaslighting very well

""I do care about women"" and then they go on and dehumanize the pregnant woman 

Rape is something we can certainly bring up because that's a cold hard reality of these laws because they benefit rapists and cause suffering for the victim

But our pro abortion arguments shouldn't just hinge on rape

Elective reasons are just as important and that should be addressed in our arguments as well ",prochoice,23.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/prochoice/comments/1jb6gq2/we_need_to_stop_bringing_up_the_rape_argument/
2025-03-14,1741914989.0,Missouri Legislators Trying to Usurp Our Vote to Protect Abortion,"In Missouri, November, 2024, Amendment 3 (the right to abortion) was on the ballot. It passed with over 1.5 million Missourians voting in favor. WELL the Missouri Senate doesn't care that we passed it! Missouri SJR 8, a new attempt to restrict abortion access, is working it's way through the Missouri Senate.

Here are links to both parts of the bill summary. [https://www.senate.mo.gov/25info/BTS\_Web/Bill.aspx?SessionType=R&amp;BillID=512](https://www.senate.mo.gov/25info/BTS_Web/Bill.aspx?SessionType=R&amp;BillID=512) [https://senate.mo.gov/23info/BTS\_Web/Bill.aspx?SessionType=r&amp;BillID=44422](https://senate.mo.gov/23info/BTS_Web/Bill.aspx?SessionType=r&amp;BillID=44422)

I don't see any exemptions for rape, incest, or the life of the pregnant person. I don't see a clarification that ONLY funds used for abortion will be withdrawn. I only see that money provided by the General Assembly will be revoked to healthcare providers (other than hospitals) that provide or induce abortions.

Has anyone aborted a baby they wanted to keep? Im 16 years old and got pregnant in September 2024 I found out in November and I knew abortion is something I would personally never do and it wasnt really an option for me I had an ultrasound at 8 weeks and instantly fell in love but when I told my boyfriend he freaked out and was so angry with me he told me I was being selfish and I was ruining his life and I said to him im sorry Ive thought about it and I just cant do it but he wasnt taking no for an answer and even told me he would end up unaliving himself If i kept the baby the guilt hit so hard and my head was a mess and we went on a break because we would argue over it 247 I told him my final decision is that I would be keeping the baby and he told me he would leave If i kept the baby so I said fine, I sat up the whole night I felt so numb and awful and the guilt was eating away at me I was scared Im only a child myself and I was going to lose someone I had been with for almost 2 years and really cared for I was so scared he would get so mad at me every time I said no to the abortion so I finally caved and told him I would do it. I had my consultation and had a medical abortion as I was about to take the tablet I stared at it for half an hour Knowing I didnt want to do it but I was scared of what my boyfriend would say so I forced it down my throat and when I started to lose the baby I regretted everything, a few months have gone by now and I still regret it while I was still bleeding I found out my boyfriend had the time had been cheating on me and now he has been out of my life for a while I feel so stupid and naive and I just want to go back in time, I feel like no one understands I know it was probably for the best Im young but that wasnt my choice I wish I was true to myself and I miss my baby so much It hurts I have this pain that never goes away I remember how much love I had for my baby and the plans I had to give them the best life I could and then I remember the pain the night I decided to do it and all the things my ex said to me haunting me, has anyone had a similar experience how did you get past It?

I feel so stupid for having this happen again. my boyfriend and i have 4 kids. aged 6, 4 (twins) and 2& the first time i had literally just given birth my baby was only 2 months. being pregnant again wasnt good for not only my body but lifes circumstances& it didnt make sense and i had to do what was best. 
the second time , my boyfriend was swearing up and down he was pulling out but then admitted after ive already found out im pregnant that he purposely stayed in& i couldve easily gotten a plan b and that experience was really hard for me because i didnt feel like i had a valid reason as to why i shouldnt keep the baby besides not being ready financially, not wanting to add a 5th child to my already 4,  it not making sense to have an abortion just to get pregnant again and keep the baby without lifes circumstances changing& but i was attached to the baby and i broke down completely having to get an abortion it broke me so badly and i never wanted to go through it again&
birth control doesnt agree with my body im already anemic and i bleed the entire time. otherwise id definitely be on something& 
my boyfriend doesnt like condoms , so i try to hold out as long as i can on sex and track ovulation days but im still here once again&  i want my baby , thats what sucks& i was just telling my boyfriend that i couldnt wait to finish nursing school, i couldnt wait until he gets where he wants to be in his career, because id like to have a final baby in a few years& i just cant do it right now and i hate myself for it. i really wish i could keep my baby. i really do& but i dont wanna be pregnant until we repair our credit, were both deep into our careers and financially secure, weve got the big house for our kids& if i cant be pregnant without stress, not having to worry about anything but my next craving , then i dont think its best& someone please give me beautiful words. im broken right now. 

i had my abortion today. they asked if id like to see the ultrasound, i said no. they asked if id like to know if they saw multiples, i said no. immediately after the ultrasound i got a mychart notification but i didnt look&
i felt okay after the abortion. i still felt like it was the best decision for right now&. i prayed and prayed and asked god that if i was making a mistake to put something in the way , but everything went so smoothly, so easily& 
i looked at that ultrasound test result when i got home. it was twins& i immediately broke down , ive never felt like a bad person, but i dont feel like i deserve to be here anymore. i shouldnt have said i wouldnt wanna know , but i didnt think that would be the case. i have been crying almost an hour. i cant take back what ive done. i dont deserve to be here i dont deserve to eat or breathe. i keep asking myself what have i done, i aborted twins = i dont think ill ever be okay",abortion,28.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jaohbd/it_was_twins_what_have_i_done/

2025-03-14,1741963333.0,Positive MA experience - 10w 0d,"Using a throwaway for this one just in case. Although every MA is different, I want to share my story in hopes it will help others in a similar situation.

I discovered I was pregnant on Feb 26th; I'd had what I thought was a light period on January 29th-30th-31st, but it turns out that must have been implantation bleeding. I thought I was only 10 days late for my period based on the timing of that bleed, but it turns out I was much further along. I hadn't had many symptoms except for very sore breasts, some tiredness and loss of appetite, all of which I tend to get before my cycle anyway, so I didn't clue in right away.

I'm in a solid, loving relationship, but we just aren't currently in a situation to add to our family. I have a young child from my previous relationship, and we live in a fairly modest apartment, and for many other reasons it just wouldn't be right to add to the family right now. 

I was a bit panicked when I found out I was pregnant, but my partner was incredibly supportive and understanding. I called my doctor the same day and was referred to our local hospital which has a program for women seeking termination. My partner brought me to the appointment, which was on Wednesday of this week. I'm based in Canada and so it was a very calm and non-judgmental environment; I'm grateful to the doctor and nurse who walked me through my options and explained everything to me.

I was given an ultrasound and blood test the same day and they determined I was at exactly 10 weeks and 0 days, the cutoff for using medical termination in my province. They mentioned I could either schedule a surgical termination for the following week, or do the medical termination as long as I was willing to take the first pill that day. I decided on the medical because I wanted to end the pregnancy as soon as possible - my last pregnancy and birth process were extremely traumatic, and being pregnant again was giving me nightmares and flashbacks, so I couldn't handle the thought of waiting any longer.

Timeline:

6:00 pm Wednesday: took the mifepristone dose as directed. Had some very mild cramping starting about two hours later, which continued the following day.

1:00 pm Thursday: developed a headache, had some additional cramping and mildly upset stomach through the rest of the afternoon.

6:00 pm: took 10 mg ketorolac with a small amount of food.

6:45 pm: took 4 Misoprostol tablets in the cheek for 30 minutes as directed, washed down with water afterwards.

9:00 pm: started having some mild cramping which came in waves, slight chills. Very mild nausea which didn't last. Watched TV with partner and just tried to relax.

10:00 pm: started having some light spotting, cramps continuing. Cramps felt like my worst period day, nothing too major. Chills and started to have diarrhea.

10:45 pm: listened to an audiobook and went to sleep.

11:30 pm: woke up to a strange sensation, felt almost like my hands weren't attached to my body. Felt something shift in my lower abdomen, then a rush of fluid. Fortunately I was wearing heavy duty period undies in addition to a pad already and had no leakage. Went to the bathroom expecting pure blood but discovered it was pink tinted fluid which I assume was water breaking. Pad completely saturated. Pain very minimal.

As soon as I sat down on the toilet I felt something drop out. Had the sensation of needing to push, did so and a much larger clump came rushing out, along with quite a bit of blood. Peeked into the toilet and could see a ring shaped clot, and noticed a light pink thing partially submerged in the blood. It was not pleasant to see and I could tell it was part of a leg/lower torso of the embryo, extremely small but unmistakable.

Had a bit of a cry. Said I was sorry. Remembered what some of the other women have said on here about their babies becoming part of the water. I did not want to be pregnant, but I couldn't help but have feelings about it. I stayed for a while before saying goodbye and flushing.

1:30 am: woke up again, mild cramping and passed some more clots. Took a second ketorolac. Came back to bed and fell asleep easily.

6:00 am: woke up at my normal time, immediately felt different than I'd been feeling for the last few weeks. Breasts still a little sore but pain noticeably reduced from how they had been feeling prior. Did not have the morning upset stomach, and was able to enjoy a coffee (I'd been having aversion to it for about three weeks). Actually had energy as opposed to feeling extremely fatigued. Had moderate amount of blood on the pad and a few tiny clots when going to the bathroom, similar to a day 2 period.

10:30 am (present): cramps have almost completely subsided, have not needed more ketorolac. Ate some breakfast. Still have what is similar to a day 2 period. Energy is much higher than it normally is at this time of the morning.

I will still need to monitor for unusual bleeding, signs of infection, or increasing pain, and will need a follow up to confirm everything has passed, but ultimately the process was not what I expected. I originally worried that 4 Misoprostol wouldn't be sufficient, given that I was 10 weeks along and I've seen stories on here of women needing double the dose. I was worried it wasn't working initially as it took quite some time for the bleeding to start.

For anyone facing this situation right now: just know that you aren't alone. You are doing what is best for your body, and if you aren't ready to give up everything for a baby it means you're doing the right thing for your baby too.

2025-03-14,1741960126.0,Abortion Anniversary,"I was just wondering what people do to commemorate their abortion anniversary if you do anything at all?  My ex and I chose a spot and put a stone angel in a lake along with letters that we both wrote.  My abortion was in 2020 and we did that the year after, Ive been attempting to visit the spot 1x a year since then.  This will be my first anniversary that my ex and I are split up, but I still want to keep going at least once a year.  I think it may even be better to go without him - last year we didnt make it there and the year before I felt like he was annoyed to be there with me.  I think he was just emotionally over the abortion and didnt care to honor it anymore which is fine but Im just not there.  Even though I am not going to have children I still feel connected to the soul that him and I created and hope to meet them in some form.  My abortion is a big part of me and it may always be, which I accept (it took me a long time to come to terms with that).  Ill see how it goes this year, but I think Ill go up to the town with the lake, stop at my favorite restaurant up there, hit the lake, and then stop at one of my favorite stores which also happens to be in that town.  Im scared that Ill be sad without him, but my heart wants to go so Im going to try.  I feel like Im spiritually connected to my ex because of this experience, which is a different conversation and another post for another time lol.

2025-03-13,1741908477.0,PH to BKK Experience (Klongtun Hospital),"Hello everyone! I just wanted to share my experience getting an MVA (Manual Vacuum Aspiration) from Klongtun Hospital in Thailand. 


So on February 2024, I found out I was around 4-5 weeks pregnant. At that time I was thinking about ordering pills from WOW and doing the Pill Method instead, but since reading reviews that shipping could take quite a while, my boyfriend and I decided to go to Thailand instead. 


Before the trip and procedure, I talked to Jenny from Klongtun on Line. She gave me the options they had and the price list for all the procedure and the room rates, she also explained what to expect before the procedure (all the lab test and etc). So eventually I booked a slot for March 14 and she gave me an appoinment card. 


Fast forward to March 14, my boyfriend and I took an early morning flight from Manila to Bangkok after everything we checked in our hotel first and had late lunch, eventually we arrived at Klongtun Hospital at around 3:50 PM. 


This was how the process went for me:
- I showed them my appointment card then they quickly asked for my passport and 500thb (cash) for the ultrasound. 

- After the ultrasound, I found out I was already 8 weeks pregnant. 

- I had a consultation and the doctor recommended I do the MVA method, since the whole procedure would only take 5 minutes and I just had to rest for 2-3 hours after. She quoted me 11,000thb for everything (all the tests, MVA procedure, and room fee). She also disclosed that the doctor who will be doing my procedure is male. Afterwards, I paid the 11k using my debit card. 

- After paying, I waited for a bit to do the physical exam (they measured my height, weight, blood pressure, and they cleaned my V and did a pap smear, tbh the pap smear was kind of painful, more painful than the ones I've had in Manila). 

- After the physical exam, they asked my boyfriend to wait in another building then they accompanied me to leave my stuff on the 2nd floor and then accompanied me to the 3rd floor to change to a hospital gown and remove my undies. 

- After changing to a hospital gown, they asked me to lie down first. At this point, there was another girl sleeping in the same room so I assumed I would also be resting there too. 

- After a few minutes they asked me to go to the operating room. It was quite hectic because as soon as I got there they asked me to lie down with my legs up, the nurse to my left stuck a needle on my left hand to sedate me to sleep, while the nurse to my right was measuring my blood pressure, then the nurse in front of me was cleaning my V for the procedure. I saw the male doctor walk in as well, all the nurses were female BTW. At this point, I was feeling very anxious and I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to sleep but yes I did fall asleep immediately after they sedated me. 

- After the procedure, I woke up in a different room with lots of beds but I was the only one there, and at this point the nurse in charge wouldn't let me go up to use the bathroom she just told me to rest and sleep. After a while, she did allow me to use the toilet and she said it was ok for me to use a bidet. At this time she showed me my new ultrasound and the baby was no longer there. She told me the don'ts after the procedure such as: don't drink or eat food that's too hot, don't use a hot compress but warm compress is ok, etc). She also told me that I was asleep for about an hour and a half. She also gave the medicine (ibuprofen, antibiotics, iron pills) and instructions post abortion. After that, I just changed to my clothes and used the sanitary pad they provided. 

- After I was done, I just chatted with some of the nurses they told me it was ok to eat spicy food and raw food. Just not to consume alcohol. 


*Some tips I think that would help:
- go on a weekday as the hospital is not crowded at all. 
- don't be shy to ask the hospital and doctors all your questions before and after the procedure. Based on my experience, they were very patient and answered everything for me. 
- the first few hours were painful for me (felt like really bad dysmenorrhea), but what really helped eased my cramps was doing a warm compress, emphasis on warm. I brought my own hot/cold pack and used it in the hotel. 
- be prepared for the Bangkok traffic, I thought Manila traffic was already crazy but Bangkok is on another level. Although in my opinion, the price of Grab here is better than in Manila. 
- I highly suggest doing this with someone you can trust, as the whole process is very overwhelming and honestly you will need help and assistance esp during the first few hours after the procedure.


I just wanted to share my experience for those who feel anxious about their situation now. For me, the whole experience was very comfortable and I'm glad I got the procedure and healthcare I needed without any prejudice. If you have any questions about the price of the procedure, or if you just have any questions I highly suggest messaging them directly. 

Will try to update again about the post abortion experience. So far it's been about 12 hours since and I don't feel any pain at all.

2025-03-13,1741901137.0,boyfriend left 3 months after abortion,"I'm really just looking for emotional support, I've been going to therapy, talking to friends, but wanted to come into this space to see if others have had similar situations.

Backstory: My boyfriend was 13 years younger than me, I have 2 kids from a previous marriage, this was really the first time I was in love with someone again after my divorce which was a couple years out at this point. We got pregnant after seeing each other for about 3 months. At the time, it felt like an relatively easy answer. Never totally easy, especially as a mom, I know what it's like to go through pregnancy and give birth and love my babies, but I went ahead and opted for a MA right away. It ended up being fairly traumatic though, because it didn't work. I had to go in and get an ultrasound to confirm, and then went on to get a D&amp;C as soon as I could after that. So yeah, totally sucked, definitely left a mark on me more so than I would have expected. 

Fast-forward a few months later: I was on birth control pills now, and end up getting pregnant AGAIN anyways. This time, I'm feeling the effects of the previous experience, my boyfriend and I are much more stable and in love as a couple. I'm not really too spiritual but the chances of all this happening really floored me. I felt so much more protective of this pregnancy, big mama bear energy. Like I wanted to meet this person. I even started looking into open adoptions and contemplated what it would be like to raise a baby on my own, which honestly I felt pretty confident about. My boyfriend was freaked out, and basically gave me an ultimatum saying that if I went and kept the pregnancy he doesn't know if he could stay with me romantically at that point. I felt SO in love with this person that as soon as he said that, that was it, I felt so committed to our relationship and was like, I can't blame him for feeling this way, I get he was young and freaking out, but I choose him and our relationship. Had a harder time getting over this abortion, got depressed, the holidays were really rough for me. I was having a ton of depression and anxiety during this time. Then in January, about 3 months after the abortion, he broke up with me. 

It's been a couple months later, and I'm just SO angry and hurt. I'm such a loyal partner and I'm just so confused. I also hate the fact that this is causing me pain and I think about this all the time and I'm sure he hasn't even realized or given it a second thought. I usually have a lot of compassion for people, like if he needed to leave the relationship, I get it, but the timing still feels so awful, it still feels like I made a huge sacrifice for nothing. I feel like I want some kind of justice, but I know the healthy thing is to forgive him and move on.

2025-03-13,1741909577.0,Struggling with grief and sadness after MA,"This is just a vent, I'm not looking for any advice. 

I am 21, from the United States, and I thought I was doing what was right for me. I still believe that to be the case (I'm active duty military, still in school, and not mentally ready for a baby), but as the days go by I keep thinking about how things might have been. I still have the pregnancy tests from when I found out and I can't bring myself to get rid of them. 

I found out on March 1st, had my MA on the 7th. It all happened so fast that I didn't allow myself to feel any of the emotions until now. From the moment I found out, I had a gut feeling that it would have been a girl. After the initial shock, I accepted the fact that I was pregnant and grew attached to the life I was growing, even though I was only five weeks. I feel like I shouldn't be having these emotions, because it wasn't actually a baby, but I do. I don't have much of a support group (my fiance seems annoyed whenever I try to talk about it, my mother - though supportive - is very emotional and cries if I cry) so I'm mostly dealing with this alone.

2025-03-14,1741914679.0,2 years later and I still hate myself.,"I had an abortion about 2 years ago. I had just started my career and was with my boyfriend for only 3 months at the time. He wanted to keep it, but ultimately told me he would support me through whatever decision I made. I was scared, and looking back I feel I made the cowardly decision. 

Fast forward to today, he broke up with me a few weeks ago saying he just didnt see us getting married. A few days ago he admitted (very kindly, gently, and while assuring me he has no ill will towards me) that he just never got past the abortion. He said deep down he doesnt think he truly forgave me for my decision, but didnt want me to feel that was my fault. He said this was his own emotional issue that he had to figure out himself. 

He was everything I wanted. I thought we would be married and starting a family soon. So did everyone around us. 

I feel so heartbroken that he doesnt forgive me. But Im more heartbroken because I truly regret the decision, and have since I did it. I cannot forgive myself. I hate myself for it. I cant help but feel like I was given everything I ever wanted, and I ruined it because I didnt trust it was the right time. I feel like god, the universe, whatever you believe in, is punishing me for not trusting the time was right, and for doing what I did. 

Im in such a dark place. I would give anything to go back and make a different decision. How do I ever forgive myself? ",abortion,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jas4oo/2_years_later_and_i_still_hate_myself/
2025-03-14,1741939059.0,My experience with surgical abortion,"Hello, I wanted to share my experience with a surgical abortion as I know reading other peoples experience helped ease my mind when I was going through it. It's quite detailed, feel free to skip straight to the abortion para, or the end if you just want the key takeaways. (I'm not going to be talking about the morality or debating, if you are pro-life this post isn't for you.)

PRE-ABORTION: I'm 23, I found out I was pregnant at 4 weeks, this was unplanned, I went to a doctor to discuss my options and was told if i wanted to terminate the pregnancy I had to be 5/6 weeks before I could have the pill. To schedule my abortion I called a woman's clinic and was recommended the surgical abortion from them which I was happier with having spoken to 2 people who had the medical one who both said they would recommend I do surgical instead. (I have a low pain tolerance and health anxiety so this made the most sense for me). For the next 2 weeks I had morning sickness and an intense fatigue accompanied with a lack of appetite and just genuinely feeling nauseous and exhausted all the time. 

ABORTION: The day of my abortion I was just over 5 weeks pregnant, when I got to the clinic i was initially in a waiting room, my boyfriend was with me, as I was going under anesthesia and so you have to have someone to drive you home and stay with you for the next 4 hours minimum. I was called in for the first part of it and was given the option to bring him with me up until the actual procedure, which i took. In this part I had an ultrasound where I saw the fetus (I wasn't asked if this is something I wanted to see), then I signed consent forms saying i wouldn't drive, understood the risks etc... 

Then I went into the next room where i spoke to the doctor who was going to be carrying out the abortion. There was a sign on the wall saying ""sometimes hard decisions are the right ones,"" which I liked. She asked me about contraception in the future and when i said condoms she accepted it without question and didn't try to pressure me into hormonal birth control which I've experienced with male doctors in the past. (We didnt use a condom the time I accidentally conceived). She then explained the procedure and that they would essentially be sucking it out of my uterus.  Next i spoke to the anesthesiologist who answered any of my questions regarding that. 

For the procedure I was given a lightweight pink robe instead of a hospital gown, a nurse took me through to the operating room. There was 3 people in total: nurse, doctor and anesthesiologist. I was freaking out at this point and they were compassionate with me and told me when the needle was going in, I began to get groggy and then they put a mask on my face and that was the last thing I remembered.

I woke up in a separate room, made private by a curtain, very groggy and confused, I was laying on a bed with a hot water bottle on my stomach. A nurse came in, asked me how i was feeling and if i wanted painkillers, to which i said yes. The pain wasn't that bad it was like period cramping I more so felt strange. They then offered me coffee/tea/juice and brought in a pack of biscuits and brought my boyfriend in to sit with me as the anesthesia started to wear off. I was there about 30/40 minutes from waking up before we were discharged. For the rest of the day I slept/ watched tv on the couch and took it really slow, as i was very tired. I have only had very minimal bleeding and light cramping since the procedure. The nausea and morning sickness went away instantly. I was given a course of antibiotics for 6 days to prevent infection as that is one of the most common side effects so i have taken one of them every day but for the most part I was fine after with very minimal pain (i used a hot water bottle, didn't need painkillers).

  
Overall I would say it went as well as it could and the procedure itself is nothing to be afraid of as you are in good hands and they do these things every single day multiple times a day, and I have a low pain tolerance and I really had very little (which was one of my main concerns). 

The only other thing to note was price, it was expensive, $700 Aud with Medicare but as i didn't have it i was $1200 out of pocket. ",abortion,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jayr3g/my_experience_with_surgical_abortion/
2025-03-14,1741971492.0,MA experience (positive),"this is my MA experience! I wanted to share after seeing so many stories that freaked me out but then I had a overall positive experience. 
I was also exactly 6 weeks when I did this. 

Wednesday, I took the first pill at 1:20pm and had absolutely no side effects to this. 

Thursday, at 2:40 I took Tylenol, ibuprofen and nausea meds then 3:20 I put the 4 pills in my mouth and let them dissolve and then I swallowed what was left of them. 
I IMMEDIATELY started getting cramps after I swallowed them I would say pain wise a 2/10 it felt like period cramps. By 5pm I started lightly bleeding and my cramps got stronger id say a 4/10. By 7pm I was still light bleeding in my pad but on the toilet I was having heavier bleeding and small clots coming out like the size of a orange seed or grain of rice. 
At 11pm I decided to take the 2nd dose of the 4 pills and by 12am I had super intense cramps 6/10 and more bleeding which then I had 1 larger clot come out that was still small but bigger then the others id say it was the size of a nickel. 
My bleeding never filled a pad during the day but overnight it got filled once and I still have some cramps on and off and bleeding. 
I'm confident that it worked based off of what I seen and how early I am so I wasn't expecting much. ",abortion,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jb8ol8/ma_experience_positive/

I do not know how far along I am ( I am about to make an appointment at PP for next week) but Im guessing I am around 8-9 weeks. Unfortunately, I have to lie and say that I am having a miscarriage. There is more info below on that. 

A couple of things - I had a MA about a year ago. The process was long and extremely painful for me. I was bleeding heavily for about 24 hours, and kept bleeding for several days with pain. It was an extremely difficult process and I still felt completely drained at my follow up appointment.

I have a few reasons why I am not sure if a SA or MA is better.

1. I will not have an informed support system this time around. I dont want to get into too many details, but I have to lie and say that I had a miscarriage and not an abortion (I know some will think this is wrong. I am sorry but it is my situation. I will be leaving this situation once the abortion is done). This is the main reason why I think a MA might be better, unfortunately.

2. The pain. I understand SA is also painful, but from what I have read, it is much quicker. And I like the idea of having a medical team with me during the whole process. 

3. I am nervous about having to sneak to two separate appointments for an MA. 

I also have a few questions, if anyone is willing to share. 

1. How long do you bleed after the SA procedure? 

2. Can a doctor tell that I have had a surgical abortion if I go to the ER? I believe they cant tell if I have had an MA.

3. When I go to my appointment, will they do the SA on that day? 

Thanks in advance for the help. Its really difficult and scary doing this by myself and keeping it a secret. I just want to be as prepared and informed as possible.

2025-03-14,1741930065.0,Post abortion depression,"
Hi, everyone. Im 22 years old located in Arizona, USA and recently had a medical abortion, which has been physically and emotionally overwhelming. Its been a few weeks since I took pill, and Im still dealing with a mix of physical symptoms, like bleeding, and feeling physically exhausted. Ive had moments where I felt like I couldnt even get out of bed due to the pain, and now Im just dealing with extremely sore boobs and light bleeding. 

Whats really hard is the emotional toll this has taken. I feel incredibly disconnected from my life, and sometimes like Im PMSing, just this intense sadness that comes and goes. The emotional part caught me off guard; Im crying more than usual and feeling like Im just stuck in a funk. I also feel a lack of support from people around me. I didnt tell anyone about the abortion and have gone through it all alone, which has made everything feel even more isolating. Ive realized I dont have anyone checking in on me to see how Im doing, and its been tough feeling so alone in this. Its hard to balance everything, my job, school, emotional health. I feel like I cant focus on anything. Im so overwhelmed and just want this feeling to go away.

The physical symptoms dont help either. Ive been feeling full faster, and eating is difficult now, which wasnt an issue before. Im trying to eat when I can, but my body feels off and Im just not sure whats going on with me. My boobs are still really sore, and its been a few weeks since the procedure, so thats been adding to everything.

I guess Im just looking for others who may have felt similar things post-abortion, or anyone who can share advice on how to get through this emotional rollercoaster. Im trying to stay positive, but right now, its been hard.

Thanks in advance.

I had decided I would track my period and we would avoid sex on ovulation or near it. But some how I guess I failed at that. I didnt want get on bc because of how it effects me mentally and I have already have mental health issues. So I thought I could track and that way Id prevent pregnancy and avoid getting on bc until his surgery that is now this month. I was told it was good way to avoid pregnancy if you didnt want to be on birth control. I figured I could handle that. We have literally had sex maybe three times at max in the last three months just trying to be cautious. I have two kids and my last baby I got car sick with. Two days ago I felt car sick and nauseous the next morning and I thought no way. Im still three days away from my period but I never get car sick expect when Im pregnant so that thought was eating me up so just to ease my mind I thought Id take a test. The way I felt sick immediately after getting the positive. Now my son birthday party is tomorrow and I have to make it through that whole time knowing Ive got so this all over again. My head wants to blame my husband because he was supposed to get V surgery over this past year and he put it off and of course when he finally gets it scheduled he had to reschedule. But two abortion back to back feels sick in my head because I know I could have prevented it and just got in bc in the mean time but besides just my mental health I didnt want my huband using me being on bc asa cop out. Not saying he has before but I thought it would make him push off my V more so if he felt I could get pregnant again ( he also doesnt want anymore kids) he would be motivated to get it done. Now I have to do the walk of shame to planned parenthood again I feel so embarrassed. The doctor there really encouraged me to get on bc and now look at me. I could break down crying. This sucks so bad and Im sorry to myself and my body. Im sorry to this baby that I cant keep. I physically couldnt carry a baby anyways anymore because after my last baby, I was told my uterus is so thin they couldnt tell the difference from a uterus in the sack. The baby was in and that I was lucky she had even made it to 36 weeks without my uterus bursting. It was due to devious c-section I have a lot scar tissue and it has sheered out my uterus.

2025-03-13,1741894005.0,im torn whether to get an abortion (CA),"Im 18 years old and in college. Im 10 1/2 weeks pregnant and have an appointment to get an abortion tomorrow (pills). But I have so much fear and anxiety around it. I told my mom and grandma I was pregnant at 3 weeks right after I found out. They were very supportive and my mom and stepdad would adopt the baby. They have two young children (under 4 years old), so my baby would be in their age range. Im also due the week before next school year starts so my pregnancy doesnt affect my schooling. When I first found out, I was so scared and nervous, but loved my baby immediately. At 6 weeks I had an ultrasound and saw the little blob and I felt so much excitement, even though I knew I would never get to raise it. HOWEVER, the issue is, my partner does not want this child. In the beginning he told me I had to get an abortion and at 6 weeks when we made the appointment to go to Planned Parenthood, I couldnt take the first pill. I sobbed and sobbed and begged him to not make me do this and he did not care. We had many fights before that appointment and after that appointment where he told me Im an awful selfish person if I keep the child and how its not okay to gamble on a childs happiness, as it will be adopted by its biological grandmother and still have contact with its birth mother (me). Sorry this is kind of all over the place, but at 4 weeks I told him I was keeping it and so he yelled at me about how much he hated me then left. I freaked out so I told him if he comes back Ill get an abortion. After the appointment where I couldnt take the pills, he left again. And for those two weeks where he was gone I have never been more depressed and lonely. I just missed him so much and wanted a partner in this. My first trimester was really really really rough (nausea, vomiting, MAJOR cramping, flu, sinus infection, ear infections, fatigue). I just began doubting if I could really survive these next 7 1/2 months and that maybe an abortion is whats best. He agreed, as he thinks its selfish to develop the embryo into a child.

2025-03-14,1741950450.0,Period and Contraception post Abortion,"Hello everyone, 

I unfortunately had an abortion on 15th Jan 2025. I bled A LOT and for a while afterwards and it stopped a little and was a lot lighter around 10th Feb but then started again a day later heavily again for about a week then carried on a lighter (bloody discharge sorry if TMI) until about 25th Feb when it fully stopped, I am not sure whether this was still bleeding from the abortion or a period? Because I never fully stopped bleeding until the 25th if that makes sense? 

Google has said it can take 4-8 weeks for a period to return, its now been 8 weeks so is this normal or should I be worried? 

Ive been keeping an eye out on my period since as I am starting the patch but want to wait until I have an actual period so I can learn my menstrual cycle again and make sure I have had an actual period since the abortion before I get on contraception.

I started bleeding again earlier in the week but it lasted one day and then normal again until today where I am bleeding lightly. 

Its so hard to pin point what is a period and what isnt after an abortion >r has anyone experienced something similar or have some advice as Im keen to start contraception soon?

17 days ago I had a suction abortion, I was 6 weeks so early to handle what I had to do. 

Im 31 year old and I have a son who is 10 years old. 

I have a stable and supportive relationship with my boyfriend of almost 2 years and we live together in my houseboat. 

I had the abortion because my boyfriend wasnt ready yet (he is 23) and also the thought of having a baby on board is possible but not at all ideal. 
I did what I knew was best even tho I got warm fuzzy feelings towards the idea of being pregnant and having a love baby together. 

Since Im not on birthcontrol (I tried several times but I have a lot of side effects wich I dont want to have) I asked if he would want a vesectomy (excuse my English as it isnt my language) but he doesnt want that so we agreed on condoms. 

I made him clear that I want him to take the lead and the responsibility in this since he is the one that isnt ready to have kids, pointed out where I put the new package of condoms etc (within reach) 

Today (17 days after the abortion) we had sex for the first time, you probably hear it coming already; as he started cuddling and slides it in unprotected.. even tho I did warn him several times AND told him I dont want to have had this abortion for nothing as we have the risk of getting pregnant directly. 

I did push him out eventually and he is a very supportive and good lovely guy but this action of him gave me a lot of emotions so I wanted to talk about it in this group. 
Afterwards I did confront him as well about if he did think when he just pushed it in and he said he did but couldnt resist.

The guilt is eating me alive, I have had a medical abortion 2 years ago and it was traumatizing! The pain I felt was extreme, and Ive vowed that I would do that again but here I am&

Ive been trying to justify my decision with the fact that Ive been experiencing severe hg and also suffer with HS (which is causing me immense pain due to the hormonal change), and as well as the thoughts that once it is gone Ill be okay again.. but my biggest excuse is that Im terrified to lose my freedom. 

Im 25 and I am in my second year of university while working full time..my spouse has landed a new job also and were excited to have a reliable income together. We are the type of people who are always doing something together, going to the movies randomly, attending concerts, clubbing, and just making spontaneous decisions..so when I found out I was pregnant, I felt like my world was coming to an end. Mind you, I do want children (we both do), but at this point in my life I feel like this is not the time :( I still want to travel the world while were young, because I know when we have children we will lose that freedom. Its killing me because Im terrified to experience that pain again, but also the guilt that we both want children. 

We have been talking about how we feel like were getting old meanwhile everyone around us has families (joking our kids wont have friends because everyone will be older). I feel so angry, and depressed that I cant properly decide on keeping the baby and settling to loose our freedom, or to abort and seek the life we wanted? Every day my decision changes like okay Ill keep it and accept the loss then the next Ill mourn the loss of my freedom and want the abortion. Im angry at my spouse because he doesnt understand the mental turmoil Im going through and is just all whatever you choose, its fine with me so Im left making this huge decision for our lives. The pain is unbearable, Ive been feeling so depressed and everyday I consider taking my own life instead, and to wait longer until April 2nd,  with these thoughts are haunting me, Im scared.

2025-03-14,1741941564.0,Abortion Is Okay Because Its Their Choice,"At the end of the day, abortion is a personal decision, and no one should be forced to stay pregnant against their will. Pregnancy is a major medical event that affects a persons body, health, future, and life in ways that only they can fully understand. No one else has to experience the physical pain, the risks, the emotional toll, or the lifelong consequences of giving birthso why should anyone else get to decide?

Some argue that a fetus has a right to life, but even if we grant that, no one has the right to use another persons body without consent. We dont force people to donate organs, even if it would save a life. If bodily autonomy applies to everyone else, why should it suddenly stop applying to pregnant people?

People get abortions for all kinds of reasonsfinancial instability, medical risks, being too young, not wanting to be a parent, or simply not wanting to be pregnant. And they shouldnt have to justify it. No one is obligated to give up their body for someone else, and pregnancy should be no exception.

If someone believes abortion is wrong, they dont have to get one.

2025-03-13,1741893655.0,PL for religious reasons - why are your churchs teachings on reproductive rights the 100% absolute truth?,"One of the biggest arguments that I see PL make is that the Bible says abortion is wrong &amp; it goes against Christian values. Faith is not something I particularly relate to, but I do think it can be comforting and deeply personal. In fact, I think its admirable that people can so strongly believe in something that there is not necessarily physical evidence of - I am truly happy for all who find comfort in it.

My question is: why do you feel that your denominations abortion beliefs is correct and above all others?

There are 6 main branches of Christianity &amp; all of them have varying beliefs on abortion. Many protestant denominations are not only pro-choice, but actively advocate for womens reproductive rights. About 60% of Catholics are pro-choice, despite the churchs view on it. 40% of Evangelical Protestants support abortion in cases of rape &amp; 51% are in support for medical reasons. The Mormon, Episcopal, Methodist &amp; Southern Baptist churches support abortion in cases of rape &amp; medical reasons. 

Of course we also need to recognize that many Christian denominations are against it. I am not denying that. But even the churchs messaging is more empathetic &amp; does not include the typical you opened your legs, deal with it sentiment I see from a lot of PL Christians. For example, Pope Francis, who is against abortion, recognizes and advocates for more support for women seeking an abortion, such as grace, community and love. The Baptist Churchs stance preaches the need for access to contraception, community support &amp; financial help. They also acknowledge the complexity of abortion, and even stated this: We acknowledge that we often lack compassion, insight &amp; the necessary commitment to serve our Christian community. We affirm our commitment to &. maintain fellowship with those whose opinions differ from ours and extend the compassion of Christ to all. 

So PL Christians, why are you so adamant that your denominations teachings are correct? Why is whatever your pastor says the 100% absolute truth? Are those who take a more liberal stance not a true Christian and if so, why do you think you or your church has the right to decide what makes someone a real Christian?

How do you justify the contradictions in the Bible? There is not a soul on earth who can never sin, even the Bible says so. Why is abortion one of the worst sins, if all sins are equal? Why do you choose that abortion is wrong, but ignore the part about loving thy neighbor and not judging?

2025-03-14,1741930652.0,Hypothetical for PL: A perfect form of birth control,"A new form of perfect birth control is developed. It has 100% efficiency and will stop 100% of unintended pregnancies. 

Here is how it will work: Nano-bots are placed inside the female reproductive system. They work by monitoring the reproductive system for new, unique human DNA. If fertilization occurs, and such unique DNA is detected, the cell containing it is destroyed by the nano-bot. 

Not only does this stop 100% of unintended pregnancies when used, they are perfectly safe for the AFAB person as they only attack unknown, unique human DNA. And, it's completely reversible, simply through remote control. 

Assuming this form of birth control could be cheap and widely available, it would most certainly have a massive impact in the abortion rate. Would the PL movement accept this as a valid alternative to bans? Are there any individual PLers in this subreddit who would find this acceptable?",Abortiondebate,100.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jawucb/hypothetical_for_pl_a_perfect_form_of_birth/

This unborn child was diagnosed with spina bifida at 20 weeks gestation. At 24 weeks, surgeons removed the child from her mothers womb and performed a surgery to repair her spinal cord. They then returned her to her mothers womb to complete the pregnancy. 

Was this child a person after being removed? Was she a non-person again after being put back in? 

Im particularly curious: suppose after being removed, the doctors determined the childs condition was more serious than anticipated and surgery offered little hope of improving the childs disability. Or, the doctors discovered another fetal abnormality inconsistent with life while the child was out. Should the mother still have the option to abort? If the mother did choose abortion at this point, why go the trouble of putting the child back in, aborting the child, then removing the child a second time as a corpse? Why not just kill the child on the outside?",Abortiondebate,130.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jakypg/was_this_child_a_nonperson_then_a_person_then_a/
2025-03-13,1741908318.0,Is It even possible to find the overall Better objective solution to abortion issues?,"A thing that i notice in so many abortion discussions Is that, usually, the best solution to abortion issues end up being Just subjective to the individual view on the matter. At the same Time through, most of abortion issues originate from the ethicality of It, which can't be completely objective because good and evil are overall subjective. Considering this, i think that the best overall ""objective"" solution to abortion issues would be a solution that wouldn't overall discriminately attack the fetus and/or the mother. The question is if It can actually be resolved in a way that would be found by the most amount possible of people as acceptable. We could try, like It Is done in many other ethical issues, to make a conclusion based on whenever or not human rights are respected in the situation. If we theorically consider fetuses as human lives(this statement Is found by overall most biologists as true based on multiple surveys such as the biomed One or others), then the killing of the human being would be considered as Murder as long as It Is premediated and unjustificate. In the law, with some excemption, Murder Is usually Only justificate if It Is done in self defense. Based on It, It can be found that if the fetus can potentially put the Life of the mother at risk, abortion would be a self defense of her Life. At the same Time through, this solution, even if It follow something objective such as the law, It probably wouldn't content a large amount of people. In conclusion, do you think that finding the overall Better solutions ( based on It being found by many as acceptable while It not discriminately attacking the mother and or the fetus) could be possible or not? If yes, how?",Abortiondebate,179.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1japy44/is_it_even_possible_to_find_the_overall_better/

Were planning on moving back to my hometown where we would both have better jobs and I would have my family there as a good support system, but my lease doesnt end til September, so Id have to endure 7 months of my pregnancy without that extra money and support. I was actually planning on not keeping the baby for these reasons, and also because Im terrified. But a part of me is really saddened by the idea of not seeing this through and having to terminate. Ive had one abortion before, and I never wanna be the person who abuses the system. Since the last abortion, weve been super careful and honestly it was super low chances that I even became pregnant this time around. Another tough part is that Im supposed to start nursing school in September, but Im due at the end of October, so Im not even sure if thats feasible.

2025-03-13,1741893655.0,PL for religious reasons - why are your churchs teachings on reproductive rights the 100% absolute truth?,"One of the biggest arguments that I see PL make is that the Bible says abortion is wrong &amp; it goes against Christian values. Faith is not something I particularly relate to, but I do think it can be comforting and deeply personal. In fact, I think its admirable that people can so strongly believe in something that there is not necessarily physical evidence of - I am truly happy for all who find comfort in it.

My question is: why do you feel that your denominations abortion beliefs is correct and above all others?

There are 6 main branches of Christianity &amp; all of them have varying beliefs on abortion. Many protestant denominations are not only pro-choice, but actively advocate for womens reproductive rights. About 60% of Catholics are pro-choice, despite the churchs view on it. 40% of Evangelical Protestants support abortion in cases of rape &amp; 51% are in support for medical reasons. The Mormon, Episcopal, Methodist &amp; Southern Baptist churches support abortion in cases of rape &amp; medical reasons. 

Of course we also need to recognize that many Christian denominations are against it. I am not denying that. But even the churchs messaging is more empathetic &amp; does not include the typical you opened your legs, deal with it sentiment I see from a lot of PL Christians. For example, Pope Francis, who is against abortion, recognizes and advocates for more support for women seeking an abortion, such as grace, community and love. The Baptist Churchs stance preaches the need for access to contraception, community support &amp; financial help. They also acknowledge the complexity of abortion, and even stated this: We acknowledge that we often lack compassion, insight &amp; the necessary commitment to serve our Christian community. We affirm our commitment to &. maintain fellowship with those whose opinions differ from ours and extend the compassion of Christ to all. 

So PL Christians, why are you so adamant that your denominations teachings are correct? Why is whatever your pastor says the 100% absolute truth? Are those who take a more liberal stance not a true Christian and if so, why do you think you or your church has the right to decide what makes someone a real Christian?

How do you justify the contradictions in the Bible? There is not a soul on earth who can never sin, even the Bible says so. Why is abortion one of the worst sins, if all sins are equal? Why do you choose that abortion is wrong, but ignore the part about loving thy neighbor and not judging? Why are you a better Christian than your neighbor who attends a more liberal church down the street?

2025-03-14,1741939059.0,My experience with surgical abortion,"Hello, I wanted to share my experience with a surgical abortion as I know reading other peoples experience helped ease my mind when I was going through it. It's quite detailed, feel free to skip straight to the abortion para, or the end if you just want the key takeaways. (I'm not going to be talking about the morality or debating, if you are pro-life this post isn't for you.)

PRE-ABORTION: I'm 23, I found out I was pregnant at 4 weeks, this was unplanned, I went to a doctor to discuss my options and was told if i wanted to terminate the pregnancy I had to be 5/6 weeks before I could have the pill. To schedule my abortion I called a woman's clinic and was recommended the surgical abortion from them which I was happier with having spoken to 2 people who had the medical one who both said they would recommend I do surgical instead. (I have a low pain tolerance and health anxiety so this made the most sense for me). For the next 2 weeks I had morning sickness and an intense fatigue accompanied with a lack of appetite and just genuinely feeling nauseous and exhausted all the time. 

ABORTION: The day of my abortion I was just over 5 weeks pregnant, when I got to the clinic i was initially in a waiting room, my boyfriend was with me, as I was going under anesthesia and so you have to have someone to drive you home and stay with you for the next 4 hours minimum. I was called in for the first part of it and was given the option to bring him with me up until the actual procedure, which i took. In this part I had an ultrasound where I saw the fetus (I wasn't asked if this is something I wanted to see), then I signed consent forms saying i wouldn't drive, understood the risks etc... 

Then I went into the next room where i spoke to the doctor who was going to be carrying out the abortion. There was a sign on the wall saying ""sometimes hard decisions are the right ones,"" which I liked. She asked me about contraception in the future and when i said condoms she accepted it without question and didn't try to pressure me into hormonal birth control which I've experienced with male doctors in the past. (We didnt use a condom the time I accidentally conceived). She then explained the procedure and that they would essentially be sucking it out of my uterus.  Next i spoke to the anesthesiologist who answered any of my questions regarding that. 

For the procedure I was given a lightweight pink robe instead of a hospital gown, a nurse took me through to the operating room. There was 3 people in total: nurse, doctor and anesthesiologist. I was freaking out at this point and they were compassionate with me and told me when the needle was going in, I began to get groggy and then they put a mask on my face and that was the last thing I remembered.

I woke up in a separate room, made private by a curtain, very groggy and confused, I was laying on a bed with a hot water bottle on my stomach. A nurse came in, asked me how i was feeling and if i wanted painkillers, to which i said yes. The pain wasn't that bad it was like period cramping I more so felt strange. They then offered me coffee/tea/juice and brought in a pack of biscuits and brought my boyfriend in to sit with me as the anesthesia started to wear off. I was there about 30/40 minutes from waking up before we were discharged. For the rest of the day I slept/ watched tv on the couch and took it really slow, as i was very tired. I have only had very minimal bleeding and light cramping since the procedure. The nausea and morning sickness went away instantly. I was given a course of antibiotics for 6 days to prevent infection as that is one of the most common side effects so i have taken one of them every day but for the most part I was fine after with very minimal pain (i used a hot water bottle, didn't need painkillers).

  
Overall I would say it went as well as it could and the procedure itself is nothing to be afraid of as you are in good hands and they do these things every single day multiple times a day, and I have a low pain tolerance and I really had very little (which was one of my main concerns). 

The only other thing to note was price, it was expensive, $700 Aud with Medicare but as i didn't have it i was $1200 out of pocket. ",abortion,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jayr3g/my_experience_with_surgical_abortion/
2025-03-13,1741894005.0,im torn whether to get an abortion (CA),"Im 18 years old and in college. Im 10 1/2 weeks pregnant and have an appointment to get an abortion tomorrow (pills). But I have so much fear and anxiety around it. I told my mom and grandma I was pregnant at 3 weeks right after I found out. They were very supportive and my mom and stepdad would adopt the baby. They have two young children (under 4 years old), so my baby would be in their age range. Im also due the week before next school year starts so my pregnancy doesnt affect my schooling. When I first found out, I was so scared and nervous, but loved my baby immediately. At 6 weeks I had an ultrasound and saw the little blob and I felt so much excitement, even though I knew I would never get to raise it. HOWEVER, the issue is, my partner does not want this child. In the beginning he told me I had to get an abortion and at 6 weeks when we made the appointment to go to Planned Parenthood, I couldnt take the first pill. I sobbed and sobbed and begged him to not make me do this and he did not care. We had many fights before that appointment and after that appointment where he told me Im an awful selfish person if I keep the child and how its not okay to gamble on a childs happiness, as it will be adopted by its biological grandmother and still have contact with its birth mother (me). Sorry this is kind of all over the place, but at 4 weeks I told him I was keeping it and so he yelled at me about how much he hated me then left. I freaked out so I told him if he comes back Ill get an abortion. After the appointment where I couldnt take the pills, he left again. And for those two weeks where he was gone I have never been more depressed and lonely. I just missed him so much and wanted a partner in this. My first trimester was really really really rough (nausea, vomiting, MAJOR cramping, flu, sinus infection, ear infections, fatigue). I just began doubting if I could really survive these next 7 1/2 months and that maybe an abortion is whats best. He agreed, as he thinks its selfish to develop the embryo into a child. He said if i get an abortion hell be there for me 24/7 and whenever I need and do whatever I need but Im very unsure. Lately, I constantly cry about loving my baby and he just corrects me saying its an embryo still. But at the same time, if I get an abortion we would be together, wed live together over the summer, wed go on trips&but I know Ill regret it for the rest of my life. My biggest dream has been to have children and I know I wont be able to raise this child, but Im so attached already. I know Ill look at my future children and wonder what if. He says my regret will pass but I adamantly dont think it will& Im unsure what to do. I feel like Im choosing short term suffering over long term suffering. I cant talk to my family about this because they are pro life, so they would not be thrilled with my actions. I just dont know what to do. My gut is telling me to keep my baby but Idk if i can handle the depression and loneliness for these next few months. But I also dont know if i can handle that regret for the rest of my life.

2025-03-14,1741939059.0,My experience with surgical abortion,"Hello, I wanted to share my experience with a surgical abortion as I know reading other peoples experience helped ease my mind when I was going through it. It's quite detailed, feel free to skip straight to the abortion para, or the end if you just want the key takeaways. (I'm not going to be talking about the morality or debating, if you are pro-life this post isn't for you.)

PRE-ABORTION: I'm 23, I found out I was pregnant at 4 weeks, this was unplanned, I went to a doctor to discuss my options and was told if i wanted to terminate the pregnancy I had to be 5/6 weeks before I could have the pill. To schedule my abortion I called a woman's clinic and was recommended the surgical abortion from them which I was happier with having spoken to 2 people who had the medical one who both said they would recommend I do surgical instead. (I have a low pain tolerance and health anxiety so this made the most sense for me). For the next 2 weeks I had morning sickness and an intense fatigue accompanied with a lack of appetite and just genuinely feeling nauseous and exhausted all the time. 

ABORTION: The day of my abortion I was just over 5 weeks pregnant, when I got to the clinic i was initially in a waiting room, my boyfriend was with me, as I was going under anesthesia and so you have to have someone to drive you home and stay with you for the next 4 hours minimum. I was called in for the first part of it and was given the option to bring him with me up until the actual procedure, which i took. In this part I had an ultrasound where I saw the fetus (I wasn't asked if this is something I wanted to see), then I signed consent forms saying i wouldn't drive, understood the risks etc... 

Then I went into the next room where i spoke to the doctor who was going to be carrying out the abortion. There was a sign on the wall saying ""sometimes hard decisions are the right ones,"" which I liked. She asked me about contraception in the future and when i said condoms she accepted it without question and didn't try to pressure me into hormonal birth control which I've experienced with male doctors in the past. (We didnt use a condom the time I accidentally conceived). She then explained the procedure and that they would essentially be sucking it out of my uterus.  Next i spoke to the anesthesiologist who answered any of my questions regarding that. 

For the procedure I was given a lightweight pink robe instead of a hospital gown, a nurse took me through to the operating room. There was 3 people in total: nurse, doctor and anesthesiologist. I was freaking out at this point and they were compassionate with me and told me when the needle was going in, I began to get groggy and then they put a mask on my face and that was the last thing I remembered.

I woke up in a separate room, made private by a curtain, very groggy and confused, I was laying on a bed with a hot water bottle on my stomach. A nurse came in, asked me how i was feeling and if i wanted painkillers, to which i said yes. The pain wasn't that bad it was like period cramping I more so felt strange. They then offered me coffee/tea/juice and brought in a pack of biscuits and brought my boyfriend in to sit with me as the anesthesia started to wear off. I was there about 30/40 minutes from waking up before we were discharged. For the rest of the day I slept/ watched tv on the couch and took it really slow, as i was very tired. I have only had very minimal bleeding and light cramping since the procedure. The nausea and morning sickness went away instantly. I was given a course of antibiotics for 6 days to prevent infection as that is one of the most common side effects so i have taken one of them every day but for the most part I was fine after with very minimal pain (i used a hot water bottle, didn't need painkillers).

  
Overall I would say it went as well as it could and the procedure itself is nothing to be afraid of as you are in good hands and they do these things every single day multiple times a day, and I have a low pain tolerance and I really had very little (which was one of my main concerns). 

The only other thing to note was price, it was expensive, $700 Aud with Medicare but as i didn't have it i was $1200 out of pocket. ",abortion,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jayr3g/my_experience_with_surgical_abortion/
2025-03-14,1741941564.0,Abortion Is Okay Because Its Their Choice,"At the end of the day, abortion is a personal decision, and no one should be forced to stay pregnant against their will. Pregnancy is a major medical event that affects a persons body, health, future, and life in ways that only they can fully understand. No one else has to experience the physical pain, the risks, the emotional toll, or the lifelong consequences of giving birthso why should anyone else get to decide?

Some argue that a fetus has a right to life, but even if we grant that, no one has the right to use another persons body without consent. We dont force people to donate organs, even if it would save a life. If bodily autonomy applies to everyone else, why should it suddenly stop applying to pregnant people?

People get abortions for all kinds of reasonsfinancial instability, medical risks, being too young, not wanting to be a parent, or simply not wanting to be pregnant. And they shouldnt have to justify it. No one is obligated to give up their body for someone else, and pregnancy should be no exception.

If someone believes abortion is wrong, they dont have to get one. But forcing others to stay pregnant against their will is not about valuing lifeits about controlling peoples bodies.",Abortiondebate,220.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jazbb9/abortion_is_okay_because_its_their_choice/
2025-03-13,1741908318.0,Is It even possible to find the overall Better objective solution to abortion issues?,"A thing that i notice in so many abortion discussions Is that, usually, the best solution to abortion issues end up being Just subjective to the individual view on the matter. At the same Time through, most of abortion issues originate from the ethicality of It, which can't be completely objective because good and evil are overall subjective. Considering this, i think that the best overall ""objective"" solution to abortion issues would be a solution that wouldn't overall discriminately attack the fetus and/or the mother. The question is if It can actually be resolved in a way that would be found by the most amount possible of people as acceptable. We could try, like It Is done in many other ethical issues, to make a conclusion based on whenever or not human rights are respected in the situation. If we theorically consider fetuses as human lives(this statement Is found by overall most biologists as true based on multiple surveys such as the biomed One or others), then the killing of the human being would be considered as Murder as long as It Is premediated and unjustificate. In the law, with some excemption, Murder Is usually Only justificate if It Is done in self defense. Based on It, It can be found that if the fetus can potentially put the Life of the mother at risk, abortion would be a self defense of her Life. At the same Time through, this solution, even if It follow something objective such as the law, It probably wouldn't content a large amount of people. In conclusion, do you think that finding the overall Better solutions ( based on It being found by many as acceptable while It not discriminately attacking the mother and or the fetus) could be possible or not? If yes, how?",Abortiondebate,179.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1japy44/is_it_even_possible_to_find_the_overall_better/
2025-03-13,1741897800.0,Am I overreacting?,"I have a 3 way group chat with a new friend in common with a girl I've been friends with since I was a teenager. (I'm 25) and thought she was a lil odd when she started texting in it daily after the 3 of us hung out once for an hour this past NYE. Any who, I found out I was pregnant Feb 2nd and we had never spoke of babies up until I found out I was preggo. She got completely fixated on that and did everything she could to suddenly get pregnant shortly after. She would send messages almost nightly about how she just got 'creampied' and give like all these details of how she was keeping the semen inside to get preggo. And then suddenly she said she and her boyfriend had been trying for a while to get pregnant and it never worked..... Well she sent a positive test probably around 2 weeks ago and she found out when she was like 8 days pregnant and had booked an ultrasound the day of at PP. Freaked out because they couldn't see the baby (because she literally just got pregnant but for some reason lied and told them she was 4 weeks pregnant) and has just been fucking non stop ever sense. I caught her lying about her saying her boyfriend was 'actively' trying to get her pregnant for a while, because now that she is he's not excited because hes 23 and he said he wasn't planning to have a baby and basically just said she started getting crazy about it out of nowhere....... I shit you not she has been daily been sending messages EVEN AT 9 DAYS PREGNANT about having food aversions, nausea, all this stuff but then when she was worried that they didn't see anything at 8 days pregnant she admitted she hasn't had any symptoms so she was concerned that they were saying they didn't see any signs of a fetus. It's just been so weird. Every day she's been non stop and normally I would be excited to have someone to relate to but I feel like she is pushing it all so hard. I struggled so bad between weeks 6-9 and she just doesn't understand idk. I'm sure she's starting to have symptoms at 4 weeks, but every single day its something but then shes out doing a whoooooole bunch of stuff which I feel like contradicts what she says and I just find it hard to believe how authentic shes being about it all because shes just been weirding me out entirely honestly. every day she just talks about herself nonstop and will go on and on and on &amp; not pick up social cues of when to stop and sometimes its like overly detailed and TMI??? She once sent a photo of toilet paper after she wiped to show her discharge ?

We were all talking in the chat today and she of course is already just going on and on and on about how shes already created her baby registry and shes going to start sending it out and she sent it in the chat to my friend &amp; I, and she was just saying how excited she is etc and I responded saying I'm just nervous because its a complete life change and something I've obviously never done before (she hasn't either) and that i hope i will be a good mom etc and she responded this entire paragraph saying this"" sometimes being a mother isn't meant for everyone, you really have to consider if this is the right choice for you, it is going to be a life altering decision, and a addition to your life that once its here it is truly your responsibility. you are a very young girl and you already have a lot of animals, if you genuinely don't think being a mother is something your going to want to do for the next 16 years until they get their license, its okay to wait a bit longer. i don't want to stress you out but there are going to be sacrifices. this is legit the rest of your life that's going to be changed. god forbid they do a sport that you hate."" and i was honestly appalled by this message. She made me feel like i was SO out of line for saying I'm genuinely nervous to be a mother and i get anxious thinking about it sometimes. Like who are you to tell me that at all? Idk. The girl just rubs me wrong honestly. Or maybe I'm just a bitch.

2025-03-14,1741963333.0,Positive MA experience - 10w 0d,"Using a throwaway for this one just in case. Although every MA is different, I want to share my story in hopes it will help others in a similar situation.

I discovered I was pregnant on Feb 26th; I'd had what I thought was a light period on January 29th-30th-31st, but it turns out that must have been implantation bleeding. I thought I was only 10 days late for my period based on the timing of that bleed, but it turns out I was much further along. I hadn't had many symptoms except for very sore breasts, some tiredness and loss of appetite, all of which I tend to get before my cycle anyway, so I didn't clue in right away.

I'm in a solid, loving relationship, but we just aren't currently in a situation to add to our family. I have a young child from my previous relationship, and we live in a fairly modest apartment, and for many other reasons it just wouldn't be right to add to the family right now. 

I was a bit panicked when I found out I was pregnant, but my partner was incredibly supportive and understanding. I called my doctor the same day and was referred to our local hospital which has a program for women seeking termination. My partner brought me to the appointment, which was on Wednesday of this week. I'm based in Canada and so it was a very calm and non-judgmental environment; I'm grateful to the doctor and nurse who walked me through my options and explained everything to me.

I was given an ultrasound and blood test the same day and they determined I was at exactly 10 weeks and 0 days, the cutoff for using medical termination in my province. They mentioned I could either schedule a surgical termination for the following week, or do the medical termination as long as I was willing to take the first pill that day. I decided on the medical because I wanted to end the pregnancy as soon as possible - my last pregnancy and birth process were extremely traumatic, and being pregnant again was giving me nightmares and flashbacks, so I couldn't handle the thought of waiting any longer.

Timeline:

6:00 pm Wednesday: took the mifepristone dose as directed. Had some very mild cramping starting about two hours later, which continued the following day.

1:00 pm Thursday: developed a headache, had some additional cramping and mildly upset stomach through the rest of the afternoon.

6:00 pm: took 10 mg ketorolac with a small amount of food.

6:45 pm: took 4 Misoprostol tablets in the cheek for 30 minutes as directed, washed down with water afterwards.

9:00 pm: started having some mild cramping which came in waves, slight chills. Very mild nausea which didn't last. Watched TV with partner and just tried to relax.

10:00 pm: started having some light spotting, cramps continuing. Cramps felt like my worst period day, nothing too major. Chills and started to have diarrhea.

10:45 pm: listened to an audiobook and went to sleep.

11:30 pm: woke up to a strange sensation, felt almost like my hands weren't attached to my body. Felt something shift in my lower abdomen, then a rush of fluid. Fortunately I was wearing heavy duty period undies in addition to a pad already and had no leakage. Went to the bathroom expecting pure blood but discovered it was pink tinted fluid which I assume was water breaking. Pad completely saturated. Pain very minimal.

As soon as I sat down on the toilet I felt something drop out. Had the sensation of needing to push, did so and a much larger clump came rushing out, along with quite a bit of blood. Peeked into the toilet and could see a ring shaped clot, and noticed a light pink thing partially submerged in the blood. It was not pleasant to see and I could tell it was part of a leg/lower torso of the embryo, extremely small but unmistakable.

Had a bit of a cry. Said I was sorry. Remembered what some of the other women have said on here about their babies becoming part of the water. I did not want to be pregnant, but I couldn't help but have feelings about it. I stayed for a while before saying goodbye and flushing.

1:30 am: woke up again, mild cramping and passed some more clots. Took a second ketorolac. Came back to bed and fell asleep easily.

6:00 am: woke up at my normal time, immediately felt different than I'd been feeling for the last few weeks. Breasts still a little sore but pain noticeably reduced from how they had been feeling prior. Did not have the morning upset stomach, and was able to enjoy a coffee (I'd been having aversion to it for about three weeks). Actually had energy as opposed to feeling extremely fatigued. Had moderate amount of blood on the pad and a few tiny clots when going to the bathroom, similar to a day 2 period.

10:30 am (present): cramps have almost completely subsided, have not needed more ketorolac. Ate some breakfast. Still have what is similar to a day 2 period. Energy is much higher than it normally is at this time of the morning.

I will still need to monitor for unusual bleeding, signs of infection, or increasing pain, and will need a follow up to confirm everything has passed, but ultimately the process was not what I expected. I originally worried that 4 Misoprostol wouldn't be sufficient, given that I was 10 weeks along and I've seen stories on here of women needing double the dose. I was worried it wasn't working initially as it took quite some time for the bleeding to start.

For anyone facing this situation right now: just know that you aren't alone. You are doing what is best for your body, and if you aren't ready to give up everything for a baby it means you're doing the right thing for your baby too.

2025-03-13,1741908477.0,PH to BKK Experience (Klongtun Hospital),"Hello everyone! I just wanted to share my experience getting an MVA (Manual Vacuum Aspiration) from Klongtun Hospital in Thailand. 


So on February 2024, I found out I was around 4-5 weeks pregnant. At that time I was thinking about ordering pills from WOW and doing the Pill Method instead, but since reading reviews that shipping could take quite a while, my boyfriend and I decided to go to Thailand instead. 


Before the trip and procedure, I talked to Jenny from Klongtun on Line. She gave me the options they had and the price list for all the procedure and the room rates, she also explained what to expect before the procedure (all the lab test and etc). So eventually I booked a slot for March 14 and she gave me an appoinment card. 


Fast forward to March 14, my boyfriend and I took an early morning flight from Manila to Bangkok after everything we checked in our hotel first and had late lunch, eventually we arrived at Klongtun Hospital at around 3:50 PM. 


This was how the process went for me:
- I showed them my appointment card then they quickly asked for my passport and 500thb (cash) for the ultrasound. 

- After the ultrasound, I found out I was already 8 weeks pregnant. 

- I had a consultation and the doctor recommended I do the MVA method, since the whole procedure would only take 5 minutes and I just had to rest for 2-3 hours after. She quoted me 11,000thb for everything (all the tests, MVA procedure, and room fee). She also disclosed that the doctor who will be doing my procedure is male. Afterwards, I paid the 11k using my debit card. 

- After paying, I waited for a bit to do the physical exam (they measured my height, weight, blood pressure, and they cleaned my V and did a pap smear, tbh the pap smear was kind of painful, more painful than the ones I've had in Manila). 

- After the physical exam, they asked my boyfriend to wait in another building then they accompanied me to leave my stuff on the 2nd floor and then accompanied me to the 3rd floor to change to a hospital gown and remove my undies. 

- After changing to a hospital gown, they asked me to lie down first. At this point, there was another girl sleeping in the same room so I assumed I would also be resting there too. 

- After a few minutes they asked me to go to the operating room. It was quite hectic because as soon as I got there they asked me to lie down with my legs up, the nurse to my left stuck a needle on my left hand to sedate me to sleep, while the nurse to my right was measuring my blood pressure, then the nurse in front of me was cleaning my V for the procedure. I saw the male doctor walk in as well, all the nurses were female BTW. At this point, I was feeling very anxious and I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to sleep but yes I did fall asleep immediately after they sedated me. 

- After the procedure, I woke up in a different room with lots of beds but I was the only one there, and at this point the nurse in charge wouldn't let me go up to use the bathroom she just told me to rest and sleep. After a while, she did allow me to use the toilet and she said it was ok for me to use a bidet. At this time she showed me my new ultrasound and the baby was no longer there. She told me the don'ts after the procedure such as: don't drink or eat food that's too hot, don't use a hot compress but warm compress is ok, etc). She also told me that I was asleep for about an hour and a half. She also gave the medicine (ibuprofen, antibiotics, iron pills) and instructions post abortion. After that, I just changed to my clothes and used the sanitary pad they provided. 

- After I was done, I just chatted with some of the nurses they told me it was ok to eat spicy food and raw food. Just not to consume alcohol. 


*Some tips I think that would help:
- go on a weekday as the hospital is not crowded at all. 
- don't be shy to ask the hospital and doctors all your questions before and after the procedure. Based on my experience, they were very patient and answered everything for me. 
- the first few hours were painful for me (felt like really bad dysmenorrhea), but what really helped eased my cramps was doing a warm compress, emphasis on warm. I brought my own hot/cold pack and used it in the hotel. 
- be prepared for the Bangkok traffic, I thought Manila traffic was already crazy but Bangkok is on another level. Although in my opinion, the price of Grab here is better than in Manila. 
- I highly suggest doing this with someone you can trust, as the whole process is very overwhelming and honestly you will need help and assistance esp during the first few hours after the procedure.


I just wanted to share my experience for those who feel anxious about their situation now. For me, the whole experience was very comfortable and I'm glad I got the procedure and healthcare I needed without any prejudice. If you have any questions about the price of the procedure, or if you just have any questions I highly suggest messaging them directly. 

Will try to update again about the post abortion experience. So far it's been about 12 hours since and I don't feel any pain at all.

2025-03-13,1741909577.0,Struggling with grief and sadness after MA,"This is just a vent, I'm not looking for any advice. 

I am 21, from the United States, and I thought I was doing what was right for me. I still believe that to be the case (I'm active duty military, still in school, and not mentally ready for a baby), but as the days go by I keep thinking about how things might have been. I still have the pregnancy tests from when I found out and I can't bring myself to get rid of them. 

I found out on March 1st, had my MA on the 7th. It all happened so fast that I didn't allow myself to feel any of the emotions until now. From the moment I found out, I had a gut feeling that it would have been a girl. After the initial shock, I accepted the fact that I was pregnant and grew attached to the life I was growing, even though I was only five weeks. I feel like I shouldn't be having these emotions, because it wasn't actually a baby, but I do. I don't have much of a support group (my fiance seems annoyed whenever I try to talk about it, my mother - though supportive - is very emotional and cries if I cry) so I'm mostly dealing with this alone.

2025-03-13,1741901137.0,boyfriend left 3 months after abortion,"I'm really just looking for emotional support, I've been going to therapy, talking to friends, but wanted to come into this space to see if others have had similar situations.

Backstory: My boyfriend was 13 years younger than me, I have 2 kids from a previous marriage, this was really the first time I was in love with someone again after my divorce which was a couple years out at this point. We got pregnant after seeing each other for about 3 months. At the time, it felt like an relatively easy answer. Never totally easy, especially as a mom, I know what it's like to go through pregnancy and give birth and love my babies, but I went ahead and opted for a MA right away. It ended up being fairly traumatic though, because it didn't work. I had to go in and get an ultrasound to confirm, and then went on to get a D&amp;C as soon as I could after that. So yeah, totally sucked, definitely left a mark on me more so than I would have expected. 

Fast-forward a few months later: I was on birth control pills now, and end up getting pregnant AGAIN anyways. This time, I'm feeling the effects of the previous experience, my boyfriend and I are much more stable and in love as a couple. I'm not really too spiritual but the chances of all this happening really floored me. I felt so much more protective of this pregnancy, big mama bear energy. Like I wanted to meet this person. I even started looking into open adoptions and contemplated what it would be like to raise a baby on my own, which honestly I felt pretty confident about. My boyfriend was freaked out, and basically gave me an ultimatum saying that if I went and kept the pregnancy he doesn't know if he could stay with me romantically at that point. I felt SO in love with this person that as soon as he said that, that was it, I felt so committed to our relationship and was like, I can't blame him for feeling this way, I get he was young and freaking out, but I choose him and our relationship. Had a harder time getting over this abortion, got depressed, the holidays were really rough for me. I was having a ton of depression and anxiety during this time. Then in January, about 3 months after the abortion, he broke up with me. 

It's been a couple months later, and I'm just SO angry and hurt. I'm such a loyal partner and I'm just so confused. I also hate the fact that this is causing me pain and I think about this all the time and I'm sure he hasn't even realized or given it a second thought. I usually have a lot of compassion for people, like if he needed to leave the relationship, I get it, but the timing still feels so awful, it still feels like I made a huge sacrifice for nothing. I feel like I want some kind of justice, but I know the healthy thing is to forgive him and move on.

I had decided I would track my period and we would avoid sex on ovulation or near it. But some how I guess I failed at that. I didnt want get on bc because of how it effects me mentally and I have already have mental health issues. So I thought I could track and that way Id prevent pregnancy and avoid getting on bc until his surgery that is now this month. I was told it was good way to avoid pregnancy if you didnt want to be on birth control. I figured I could handle that. We have literally had sex maybe three times at max in the last three months just trying to be cautious. I have two kids and my last baby I got car sick with. Two days ago I felt car sick and nauseous the next morning and I thought no way. Im still three days away from my period but I never get car sick expect when Im pregnant so that thought was eating me up so just to ease my mind I thought Id take a test. The way I felt sick immediately after getting the positive. Now my son birthday party is tomorrow and I have to make it through that whole time knowing Ive got so this all over again. My head wants to blame my husband because he was supposed to get V surgery over this past year and he put it off and of course when he finally gets it scheduled he had to reschedule. But two abortion back to back feels sick in my head because I know I could have prevented it and just got in bc in the mean time but besides just my mental health I didnt want my huband using me being on bc asa cop out. Not saying he has before but I thought it would make him push off my V more so if he felt I could get pregnant again ( he also doesnt want anymore kids) he would be motivated to get it done. Now I have to do the walk of shame to planned parenthood again I feel so embarrassed. The doctor there really encouraged me to get on bc and now look at me. I could break down crying. This sucks so bad and Im sorry to myself and my body. Im sorry to this baby that I cant keep. I physically couldnt carry a baby anyways anymore because after my last baby, I was told my uterus is so thin they couldnt tell the difference from a uterus in the sack. The baby was in and that I was lucky she had even made it to 36 weeks without my uterus bursting. It was due to devious c-section I have a lot scar tissue and it has sheered out my uterus. So I dont really have a choice but at the same time I had a choice to get in bc but my stupidity and choices have led me back to this. Im so sorry.

At this point in time, Ive had two abortions. The first time was simply my first time ever getting pregnant and i wasnt even sure if I was able to. Plus the events around the first time made the choice easier. The second time, it was more so realizing this full situation Im in and Id possibly be in if I had the child. I was still stressing and this time the choice was a little bit more difficult than before because I felt that maybe it wouldnt be that bad, but then again this shouldnt have happened twice. I had more feelings the second time as well. I went outside and just let loose. The way I was reacting had me questioning myself, but I was told those feeling were normal when I went the first time.

2025-03-14,1741922753.0,Struggling with my decision.,"

Im struggling with my decision to have an abortion. Im currently 6 weeks, and the next available appointment isnt until April 2nd (by then Ill be 9 weeks). The guilt is eating me alive, I have had a medical abortion 2 years ago and it was traumatizing! The pain I felt was extreme, and Ive vowed that I would do that again but here I am&

Ive been trying to justify my decision with the fact that Ive been experiencing severe hg and also suffer with HS (which is causing me immense pain due to the hormonal change), and as well as the thoughts that once it is gone Ill be okay again.. but my biggest excuse is that Im terrified to lose my freedom. 

Im 25 and I am in my second year of university while working full time..my spouse has landed a new job also and were excited to have a reliable income together. We are the type of people who are always doing something together, going to the movies randomly, attending concerts, clubbing, and just making spontaneous decisions..so when I found out I was pregnant, I felt like my world was coming to an end. Mind you, I do want children (we both do), but at this point in my life I feel like this is not the time :( I still want to travel the world while were young, because I know when we have children we will lose that freedom. Its killing me because Im terrified to experience that pain again, but also the guilt that we both want children. 

We have been talking about how we feel like were getting old meanwhile everyone around us has families (joking our kids wont have friends because everyone will be older). I feel so angry, and depressed that I cant properly decide on keeping the baby and settling to loose our freedom, or to abort and seek the life we wanted? Every day my decision changes like okay Ill keep it and accept the loss then the next Ill mourn the loss of my freedom and want the abortion. Im angry at my spouse because he doesnt understand the mental turmoil Im going through and is just all whatever you choose, its fine with me so Im left making this huge decision for our lives. The pain is unbearable, Ive been feeling so depressed and everyday I consider taking my own life instead, and to wait longer until April 2nd,  with these thoughts are haunting me, Im scared.

2025-03-13,1741894005.0,im torn whether to get an abortion (CA),"Im 18 years old and in college. Im 10 1/2 weeks pregnant and have an appointment to get an abortion tomorrow (pills). But I have so much fear and anxiety around it. I told my mom and grandma I was pregnant at 3 weeks right after I found out. They were very supportive and my mom and stepdad would adopt the baby. They have two young children (under 4 years old), so my baby would be in their age range. Im also due the week before next school year starts so my pregnancy doesnt affect my schooling. When I first found out, I was so scared and nervous, but loved my baby immediately. At 6 weeks I had an ultrasound and saw the little blob and I felt so much excitement, even though I knew I would never get to raise it. HOWEVER, the issue is, my partner does not want this child. In the beginning he told me I had to get an abortion and at 6 weeks when we made the appointment to go to Planned Parenthood, I couldnt take the first pill. I sobbed and sobbed and begged him to not make me do this and he did not care. We had many fights before that appointment and after that appointment where he told me Im an awful selfish person if I keep the child and how its not okay to gamble on a childs happiness, as it will be adopted by its biological grandmother and still have contact with its birth mother (me). Sorry this is kind of all over the place, but at 4 weeks I told him I was keeping it and so he yelled at me about how much he hated me then left. I freaked out so I told him if he comes back Ill get an abortion. After the appointment where I couldnt take the pills, he left again. And for those two weeks where he was gone I have never been more depressed and lonely. I just missed him so much and wanted a partner in this. My first trimester was really really really rough (nausea, vomiting, MAJOR cramping, flu, sinus infection, ear infections, fatigue). I just began doubting if I could really survive these next 7 1/2 months and that maybe an abortion is whats best. He agreed, as he thinks its selfish to develop the embryo into a child. He said if i get an abortion hell be there for me 24/7 and whenever I need and do whatever I need but Im very unsure. Lately, I constantly cry about loving my baby and he just corrects me saying its an embryo still. But at the same time, if I get an abortion we would be together, wed live together over the summer, wed go on trips&but I know Ill regret it for the rest of my life. My biggest dream has been to have children and I know I wont be able to raise this child, but Im so attached already. I know Ill look at my future children and wonder what if. He says my regret will pass but I adamantly dont think it will& Im unsure what to do. I feel like Im choosing short term suffering over long term suffering. I cant talk to my family about this because they are pro life, so they would not be thrilled with my actions. I just dont know what to do. My gut is telling me to keep my baby but Idk if i can handle the depression and loneliness for these next few months. But I also dont know if i can handle that regret for the rest of my life.

17 days ago I had a suction abortion, I was 6 weeks so early to handle what I had to do. 

Im 31 year old and I have a son who is 10 years old. 

I have a stable and supportive relationship with my boyfriend of almost 2 years and we live together in my houseboat. 

I had the abortion because my boyfriend wasnt ready yet (he is 23) and also the thought of having a baby on board is possible but not at all ideal. 
I did what I knew was best even tho I got warm fuzzy feelings towards the idea of being pregnant and having a love baby together. 

Since Im not on birthcontrol (I tried several times but I have a lot of side effects wich I dont want to have) I asked if he would want a vesectomy (excuse my English as it isnt my language) but he doesnt want that so we agreed on condoms. 

I made him clear that I want him to take the lead and the responsibility in this since he is the one that isnt ready to have kids, pointed out where I put the new package of condoms etc (within reach) 

Today (17 days after the abortion) we had sex for the first time, you probably hear it coming already; as he started cuddling and slides it in unprotected.. even tho I did warn him several times AND told him I dont want to have had this abortion for nothing as we have the risk of getting pregnant directly. 

I did push him out eventually and he is a very supportive and good lovely guy but this action of him gave me a lot of emotions so I wanted to talk about it in this group. 
Afterwards I did confront him as well about if he did think when he just pushed it in and he said he did but couldnt resist.

Was this child a person after being removed? Was she a non-person again after being put back in? 

Im particularly curious: suppose after being removed, the doctors determined the childs condition was more serious than anticipated and surgery offered little hope of improving the childs disability.

I'm literally crying my eyes out as I type this. I'm 39+6 today, I will be 40 weeks tomorrow. I have tried *everything* I can do get this baby out since 39 weeks. Now before I get lectured about being patient and letting the baby &amp; my body do what it needs to do, I want to say that unless you're in my situation, I don't want to hear that. 

I wanted to be induced at 40 weeks from the beginning as this as been a very difficult pregnancy and I *have* to work up until I give birth and I work as a housekeeper at a hospital, so I have a physically demanding job. I have accomodations and now I only clean one corridor during my shift but at this point, I'm so exhausted. Everything hurts. I have no stamina or energy anymore.

But at my last appointment with my OB, she didn't want to schedule an induction and wanted to discuss it later (this was at 37 weeks) I missed my 38 week appointment due to oversleeping and I missed my 39 week appointment which was yesterday due to the fact that I was having contractions and believed I was going into labor so I spent the time that should've been my appointment, at the hospital being evaluated for the contractions. The contractions stopped. So, it was false labor I guess. 

My next appointment is on the 19th but my doctor will be out of office and I'm meeting with her nurse instead. 

But I can't take this anymore. I just want relief. I'm sick of working while heavily pregnant. I just want to have my baby and start my leave. 

I'm going to try the miles circuit again tonight but if that doesn't work, I feel like my last resort is to go to L&amp;D and beg for them to induce me tomorrow at 40 weeks. I don't care about pitocin, emergency C-Sections, or anything else. I am literally losing my mind, I'm at my wit's end and I can't stop crying, I can't take this anymore

I go to a small doctors office which is actually known for their midwives, id say 85-90% of their clients see the certified midwives (If Im not mistaken most if not all of the midwives are nurse practitioners), I am in the minority and I see the medical director who is the only licensed doctor.

Hes one guy so like is it safe to assume hes the one that will deliver?? I mean Im not against the midwives seeing me they have amazing reviews where I live and like I said most people come to the practice for them but they only ever schedule me with my doctor.

2025-03-13,1741898316.0,Pregnant and Conflicted  Need Advice,"I found out about a week ago that Im pregnant (currently 4 weeks and 4 days). My boyfriend (22) and I (25) always said that if an ""oops"" happened, abortion would be the planbut we also acknowledged that you never truly know how youll feel until you're in that situation. And now, here we are.

I finish my nursing degree in December, have a steady job managing social media (which isnt hard to do and pays well), and were planning to move to Florida next summer. My boyfriend still has at least 3-4 years left of school (he's studying to be a chiropractor or physical therapist), and while he wants to be a dad one day, he admits now is not ideal. That said, he has made it clear that its ultimately my choice, since its my body.

I am pro-choice, but the thought of going through an abortion puts me in such a dark place mentally that I genuinely dont think I could survive it. Its not that I feel ""ready"" to be a mombecause who ever really is?but I just cant see myself going through the process of an abortion. His mom initially said its my decision, but she supports abortion and even called me to basically push for it. My boyfriend, while not pressuring me, also knows keeping the baby isnt what he would have chosen.

I know having a baby right now would make things a lot harder, especially with our move coming up. But I also know I *can* do it. My job is remote, and Ill still be able to work once we move. Plus, Ive always dreamed of being a momliterally forever. I want to be a pediatric or NiCU nurse, and once we move, I plan to find a job in either PEDS or NICU nursing while continuing to work remotely. Having a baby while finishing school wasnt part of the plan, but its not impossible.

Whats weighing on me is knowing that this wouldnt be his choice, and that his mom has already made it clear where she stands. He also told me that if we keep the baby, he probably wouldnt be able to work while studying, and he wants to be able to give the baby everything. I dont want to ruin his future, but I also feel like Id be ruining myself if I went through with an abortion.

Our relationship is so full of love, and the idea of ending this pregnancy when we are happy together *hurts*. It haunts me. I just dont know what to do.

2025-03-13,1741896873.0,Feeling territorialanyone else?,"Admittedly this isnt a huge deal, but for some reason it **really** bugs me. 

Im at 32 weeks, and friends have been giving gifts and signing them Aunt. For example, they sign their name as Aunt Jane in cards to me, or with a note to baby on the inside of a book. 

No one has asked me how I feel about it, and tbh it feels weird!! I love these people, but many of them live far away, and I would call them FRIENDS, not family. Im so excited for them to meet this baby and vice versa, but I dont think they will be the babys family. 

Obviously family isnt just blood or marriage. But not every friend is family. Some friends are just friends, even if they are very good friends!

I think it bugs me because while I know they are really writing this because they feel close to me, my baby is a separate person. I want this baby to be able to have clear boundaries and expectations with adults. I want them to understand what it means to have familywhat you should be able to expect from family, and what they should be able to expect from you. Friends and family might blur together sometimes, but if someone says theyre your family, kids should be able to form ideas of what that means. And if they decide one of my friends feels like an aunt to them, or we become so interdependent with someone that they become family, then great! But thats not where we are with these folks. 

I know were some time away from these things actually becoming an issue, and that likely it will never be an issue. But some of these folks I see once every 1-3 years. I dont want to show up at their house for a visit one day and have to explain to them then that no, Im not going to tell my child to call them aunt, and they shouldnt ask for that, either. 

My husband assures me this is very far from a big deal, and I know hes right, but it just feels very intrusive. Its like the emotional equivalent of someone touching your belly without asking. I know people already love this baby, and I love that, but they are their own little person, not just an extension of me. 

I know others will likely have their own opinions here. Please feel free to share, but Id also just ask up front that you dont feel the need to say there is a right vs wrong here or try to put down the feeling that Im having.

For a good few weeks I have been feeling bumps on my cervix, that's the best I can describe it, it's not a real twinge of pain but a noticeable little jab feeling really low down in the cervix area. I am very occasionally having what I believe is round ligament pain more towards the front, on either side, and that is indeed painful. I read that baby kicks will feel like bubbles or flutters, might I be feeling something more like pain because the cervix area is more sensitive? I had ultrasounds at 11 and 12 weeks and the techs commented that he was particularly active.

  
All that said, I am having some pelvic girdle pain, initially across my lower back and more recently up inside my thighs, the hip adductor. So maybe that's what's causing the little jabs as it's the same area.

2025-03-14,1741977997.0,Gestational diabetes test results,"So Im so frustrated right now because of my glucose testing. 

For some background, I have PCOS, so glucose is something we are concerned about. I went in for 2 hour glucose testing at 15 weeks, and my fasting level was normal as well as my 2 hour level. 

I went in for the routine one hour glucose test at 26 weeks and failed. Which, I was like okay no biggie, lots of people fail their one hour test. 

I went in for my three hour test, and I ended up high for my fasting level. I was a 103, but honestly I think that could be explained by the fact that fasting can make your glucose go up if you have PCOS (they had me fast for 12 hours this time whereas last time I only fasted for 8 hours), AND the girl taking my blood was CLEARLY new. She stabbed my arm like 6 times before moving over to the other arm, again stabbed me like 6 times, and finally had to go get someone else to do it. I REALLY dont do well with blood, and stress can cause your blood sugar to spike. 

My one hour came back and it was exactly 180, which is the cutoff. Then I passed my 2 hour and 3 hour with flying colors! Like, I was a 140 for my two hour (cutoff is 155), and I was a 118 for my three hour (cutoff is 140). 

My doctor calls me today and tells me that I have gestational diabetes. Uhm, WHAT??!!! What do you mean???? I passed my two hour and my three hour test???? And I was right at the cutoff for my one hour test. So they basically just qualified me because my fasting levels are off ? Even though that can be explained by my PCOS and the stress of being stabbed multiple times. And because my one hour test is EXACTLY on the 180 mark? 

I just feel like my doctors dont know what theyre talking about which makes me so nervous. And I was trying to talk to the nurse and she just kept saying your results were abnormal so you qualify and I was like but then why did I even do the two and three hour testing?? If you were going to qualify me from the one hour why didnt you do that the first time I failed my one hour test at 26 weeks?? They told me I had to go in to see how I did at 2 hours and 3 hours and that would determine whether I had it or not. And I passed both of those well within the normal range! 

I just really dont want to prick my finger four times a day if it doesnt seem necessary. I am really really really not good with blood. I of course will do whatever I need to do to protect my baby, but I just wish someone could explain to me how these numbers mean that I have gestational diabetes. I thought you could fail your one hour and still be fine, but apparently being exactly on the cutoff for one hour and being high for a fasting level is enough to qualify you?

I see a ton of posts about inductions being pushed for suspected large babies but not small, so I wanted to initiate the conversation and see if anyone has experience with this. I have had a totally normal healthy pregnancy so far, 31 years old pregnant with my first baby (a baby boy!) and underwent a routine 36 week US at my office (in retrospect I wish I declined this but you live and you learn) which showed that my baby's estimated fetal weight is 9th percentile, which is technically ""fetal growth restriction"". Of note he measured 24th percentile at prior ultrasound at 28 weeks. I have a repeat growth scan at 38 weeks 3 days and if he is still 9th percentile my OB is recommended induction between 38 to 39 weeks. I have had BPPs and dopplers to check blood flow which have all been totally normal, and I have a gut feeling that this is all seriously overkill. Also of note I was a small baby (6lb4oz at birth) and my husband and I are not big people (115lb pre pregnancy, husband is 150lb), and I have only gained 20-25 lbs during pregnancy. I am praying that he is 10th percentile or above at the growth scan so this is all a moot point, but if he does remain 9th percentile I am really inclined to decline induction if everything else remains stable as to not open the can of worms for cascade of intervention, but of course my first priority is baby's safety and would never want to put him at risk in doing so.

Ill get straight to the point, me and my gf are expecting our little girl in May and I could not be anymore excited to be a girl dad! She is currently 7 months so its getting closer. 

Tonight we had a bad argument. My gf has been sooooo clingy to the point its suffocating me. I dont understand and never will understand pregnancy, all I could do is research but Ill never understand what it feels like. I applause all you women who sacrifice your bodies for our children.

Shes been so clingy up the point where if I wanna go to the gym, take care of errands, or go with my family, she gets upset. I tell her to go with me but the days she doesnt feel like doing anything, she stays and complains. Ive been going to the gym and dropping weight and feeling better and I work pretty much everyday because Im trying to save up for a new house for all three of us. Its non stop with me, Im always working just to save money and grind for us. 

Tonight, she started ranting to me that Im never there for her or she feels alone. Ive heard it before and I step up and when she asks me to massage her feet, back, shoulders, etc I do it with no complaints. I always check on her when Im at work and always asks if she needs anything before I get home. She once again, said that she feels like Im not affectionate when all I do is care for her. She literally thanked me the other day and said she appreciates me everyday because Im so good to her but tonight I hit a boiling point..

I regret it and said some ugly things because she started saying ugly things to me and absolutely HATE yelling especially since our little girl can hear now. But I feel soooo unappreciated when she complains about me daily and when Im doing the best I can for her.. and for us.. we never really fight but its just built up and built up to the point where I got mad tonight. She left and went to go stay with her sister. Another thing i talked to her about was keeping our business private. The last fight we had she went and told her mom& like we have these arguments but I never go and run and tell my parents.. its so frustrating. I love her and thank her everyday for carrying our little girl but I feel like she doesnt see how HARD Im trying for us. I come home from work and I cuddle with her and spend time with her and its not good enough.. still saying Im not affectionate. She began crying saying that Im not affectionate and everything Im literally trying my best here.. but anything I do isnt good enough.

2025-03-14,1741977287.0,Im so scared,"Tw high risk
First pregnancy, went in for my anatomy scan at 20 weeks and Im 23 now and just had another because the original one couldnt see her limbs well. Everything else was normal on the first one, she was a little small but nothing crazy either 35th or 25th percentile I cant remember. On this one I did earlier this week, yesterday, they told me her head measured below the 3rd percentile and her body was the 19th. Shes still active and OB said my belly is measuring fine and heart sounds great, but Im being referred to a high risk specialist to do a more detailed ultrasound.
Im terrified. Im so scared shes not growing enough and Ive done something wrong. Recently Ive been dealing with insane amounts of stress causing inappetence and heart palpitations, but Im not underweight and Im still able to force stuff down. Dr isnt concerned with my weight or calorie intake either since its only been the past couple weeks, but what can I do?? My partner is taking over the role of taking care of the family matter thats caused so much stress (basically out of nowhere they started talking to his ex again and she doesnt like me bc she wants the dog and I have been working with him and the day she came she wanted to have him and I said not today bc I was about to go the vet in a couple hours to see if he had cancer and I wanted him to come home and relax. He does have cancer and his surgery is next week. Anyway his brother and mom and dad all love her and she came to stay with his twin brother, and then they all got together at dinner without us and started talking shit about me, doing background checks on me, trying to tell my partner Ive lied about who I was bc they couldnt find my last job and one of my degrees on it and they dont see him as much so I must be controlling and manipulating him, meanwhile Im just trying to fuckin feed myself and nest. WHOLE BIG THING) so partner is going to tell them theyre either cut off or it all stops and they need to cut the ex off. He thought I was crazy at first bc inconceivable right?? but once it all came to light he was so pissed and apologized heavily for not supporting 100% in the beginning. BESIDE THE POINT. Its put my daughter at risk and I have been an absolute mess. 
Now what?? I havent gotten the call to schedule the referral yet, my childhood friend lost her first baby at 6 months because she also stopped growing, and I dont know what I can do? Has this happened to anyone and they went for the referral and everything was fine? Is it possible shes just small? My moms and my sisters babies were all tiny and we are all fine?

They hooked me up to iv and did a quick ultrasound to check my fluids which they said my amniotic fluid was low. The fluids helped and made his heart rate go down to the 150s ( his heart rate has never been 150s before but I trust what they say. ) they had me come back for a non stress test yesterday which his heart rate was still elevated in the 160s to 170s going back and forth while he was awake but when he fell asleep towards the end his heart rate was in the 150s again. I mentioned they said my amniotic fluid was low on the ultrasound they did but they didnt seem concerned about checking again. Now at my next appointment in a few days they want me to come back for another non stress test after my appointment with my doctor. Anyone else gone through this?

2025-03-14,1741911316.0,"Today I had the most inappropriate, violating, dismissive, condescending care ever by an MFM who has never met me before."," WARNING  If you are near Long Island, NY and you ever have a pregnancy in which you need a referral to an MFM for possible high-risk factors, DO NOT EVER go to Cecilia Avila, part of Stony Brook Medicine. Every other doctor in this practice is wonderful. I got the bad egg this time due to bad timing and luck. 

Today I received the most inappropriate and VIOLATING care Ive ever received by a doctor (keep in mind this includes the team and surgeons that *misdiagnosed my appendicitis and left my appendix in by accident*, rendering me infertile and needing IVF in the first place. I wish I had looked up her reviews beforehand. Theyre dreadful. 

Today I was supposed to see an MFM one more time as a formality to make sure I can continue under the Midwives care for the remaining 1-4 weeks of my pregnancy and deliver with them. Thats not what happened. 

Would rate negative stars if I could. She came into the room without ever greeting me or introducing herself. Without ever having met me or reviewing my chart, told me she refuses to allow me back into the SBU midwives care although I have *no high-risk factors* at 36 weeks other than my age (45) and this being an IVF pregnancy. (The baby is in perfect health and is growing on schedule. I am in perfect health, BP is fine, no GD.)

She then told me my plan to go to 40 weeks is basically killing my baby, although Id already been cleared by another MFM in the practice to do exactly that with close monitoring. The statistics for placental issues after 39 weeks for IVF/older patients are in 17/1000 births as opposed to 11/1000 births in other pregnancies. Thats still only 1.7% vs 1.1% - yes, its 42% higher than younger natural pregnancies but LOOK AT THE NUMBERS. 

She went on a rant, speaking poorly of all of these IVF patients lately who dont want induction or to go before 40 weeks and want care other than MFM. Her opinion on IVF patients desire for the least invasive options that can *safely* be done was vile and simply& wrong. Im not a monster for wanting to be under the care of midwives that are still connected to the hospital system, particularly when an OB or MFM on call at the hospital can take over at any time if medically necessary. 

The icing on the cake was when she did a RECTAL SWAB INSERTION for Group B Strep with no forewarning of what she was about to do. I understand this can be part of the process, but a decent doctor would tell the patient what she was about to do first. Had I done this at my midwife appointment, the swab wouldve been self-administered and ONLY vaginal. Not even a hello, and she was shoving a Q-tip up my ass. 

Ive never been treated like this by any medical professional  in 45 years of life. She was dismissive, haughty, condescending, rude, and violating. She does not belong seeing patients. She should be a desk doctor only, reviewing paperwork or in a lab somewhere. Her knowledge of IVF pregnancies is outdated and shes not up on the current peer-reviewed science. She bases opinions on old information and is not interested in hearing new statistics. Checking her reviews, she has told patients to TMFR without doing any actual diagnostic testing!

An MFM sees patients who are high-risk and already frightened and anxious about their pregnancies and their babies health. To treat these patients with anything other than kind, gentle, compassionate care is negligent at best, and dangerous and detrimental to both mental and physical health.

Im not a Karen. I have never reported a doctor in all of the years Ive been alive. Ive seen MANY doctors. This is the first time I have ever been treated like this. I am filing a formal complaint with Patient Advocacy as well as the home office. I plan to contact the Board as well. It seems Im not the first patient who has had this experience - but I want to make sure I am the last. No one should ever be told theyre killing their baby or have an invasive test without warning. 

I honestly have no idea who will be handling my pregnancy here on out, and its so jarring. I was almost at the finish line.

Born on the 9th at 5lbs 1.6 ounces. But shes perfect and stays in room with me and husband. No breathing issues, no real health concerns. Im feeling immediate relief and two hours later I feel like I could already slowly walk a marathon around the hospital. Pain is minimal and my nurses are telling me how amazing it is that Im so okay. Were over the moon and bonding, though husband is sad about missing the birth by minutes.

Then I wake up at 2am that first night covered in sweat and shaking so badly I cant safely pick up my baby. Call the nurse, and I have a temp of 102 but no pain or other symptoms of anything. The nurses and midwife are stumped because aside from the fever they track over 2 days, Im perfectly fine. No stomach pain, minimal bleeding, no discomfort. They do rounds of blood work and even send me down for a CT scan the night of the 11th.

And find appendicitis. So I have my baby on the 9th and my appendix removed on the 12th. And after the recovery, our planned 2 day hospital stay turned into 5. But were home now and adjusting, and in a way it all feels like some weird fever dream, going from 4 to 10 centimeters in about an hour. Im in more pain from the surgery than the delivery, but baby is healthy and thriving and thats all that really matters.

2025-03-14,1741957343.0,Pregnancy ruined my teeth,"* I dont need advice 

I want to preface this by saying I did have dental issue prior to my first pregnancy but it was manageable at the time. This is a direct result of my pregnancy. Anyways I had my second baby last year (2 under 2) and one of the most disheartening things has been my teeth. I have to get dental implants because my pregnancy cost me my bottom molars on both side. During my pregnancy I had HG which made me severely anemic, malnourished, and stressed. I would grind my teeth at night, threw up at any time especially early morning, and I couldnt stomach tooth paste. I couldnt take my prenatal either because even after trying 7 different brands I would vomit to the point of bleeding after taking them. Which means my babies took the calcium they needed from me. On top of everything I was so depressed that I barely cared once I noticed my teeth literally cracking (was speaking out pieces of teeth). With this combination my teeth were destroyed with the latest being pulled last month. I hate to smile now because my teeth have cracks, chips, and holes in most of my teeth. I lost my job during my first pregnancy so I have basic dental care through medicaid which doesnt cover the work I need. I love my babies dearly but I didnt know it would cost me my smile in so many ways. Emotionally and mentally I barely want to smile and now its a physical reason that my smile feels horrible. Please take your prenatals, please push your doctors to check your levels to insure youre not deficient anywhere, and do remember that pregnancy is harsh. Never have a baby for any reason other than YOU wanting that baby because it can cost you in ways you never wouldve thought. I had my babies for me of course but the cost hit really fast.

So um. Nobody prepared me for the pain that comes with contractions. The pain will be different for everyone of course, but in my experience contractions started off like bad abdominal period cramps for a day, very tolerable. The following day.. they progressed to my back and it felt like someome was using all their force and swinging a baseball bat into my tailbone/lower back =5=« HOLY F!! No one prepares you for that. I just remember thinking God PLEASE help me!  and all you can do is shut your eyes as tight as they allow and groan through it. 

I finally went to the hospital that second night and next came the cervical check. The cervical check to me, felt like a sharp hot knife entering your vagina.. WTFFF. I instantly started sobbing and asked the nurse to please stop, and that i dont want to have a cervical check done. She told me she barely even went in but i was sobbing uncontrollably, i couldnt catch my breath, the pain was like nothing ive ever felt before. They had to convince me to get a cervical check with the help of fentanyl. Once I got the fentanyl, I was able to tolerate a cervical check. I was 6cm dilated. Thank you God for modern medicine! 

The pain absolutely wiped me out, I just wanted to sleep in between each contraction, my eyes would shut from all the pain and my body wanted me to fall asleep because it took every ounce of energy out of me. But then another contraction would beat you up awake again =5=«=-


My pain tolerance must be so low! I got the epidural shortly after being admitted... epidural = pure bliss.

I'm not high risk,  nor have I had any complications other than terrible pregnancy sickness.  

The anxiety is just horrible, I have stomach issues, even before pregnancy and I was warned the scar tissue could turn cancerous if I don't take care of myself so I already have a chance of dying it feels like.  (I've been puking stomach acid this while pregnancy, I know it's getting worse I can feel the pain from time to time) 

No matter what my bf thinks, I'm going to tell the Dr to deliver my baby that if any complications arise, save me before, baby.  We can have another kid. My mom can't have another me.  I never wanted to be a mom, so I had no intention of dying for a child I didn't want.

I'm worried my bf will hate me for saying that, but I've said since we met, I didn't want kids.  This pregnancy was not planned, and he's the ""God gave us this kid for a reason"" type of guy.  So, he probably would've left me had I went through with  the termination.  Of all the women out there PRAYING for a baby, why did it have to be ME that gets one??


Edit
He is not using me for a baby.  That's not what happened.  The condom broke, and I got pregnant.  I told him from the beginning that if I'd accidentally fall  pregnant, I wasn't sure if I'd keep it.  But, he proved to me that he isn't like my father was to me. He'll be a great dad.  We were together for a while before it happened, I know him like the back of my hand.  And he knows me like the back of his hand.  We never argued or fought once. We had disagreements, but it was settled quickly without any problems.  I wanted it to be us for a while longer before we had kids if we got to that point.

(I'm 25) and thought she was a lil odd when she started texting in it daily after the 3 of us hung out once for an hour this past NYE. Any who, I found out I was pregnant Feb 2nd and we had never spoke of babies up until I found out I was preggo. She got completely fixated on that and did everything she could to suddenly get pregnant shortly after. She would send messages almost nightly about how she just got 'creampied' and give like all these details of how she was keeping the semen inside to get preggo. And then suddenly she said she and her boyfriend had been trying for a while to get pregnant and it never worked..... Well she sent a positive test probably around 2 weeks ago and she found out when she was like 8 days pregnant and had booked an ultrasound the day of at PP. Freaked out because they couldn't see the baby (because she literally just got pregnant but for some reason lied and told them she was 4 weeks pregnant) and has just been fucking non stop ever sense. I caught her lying about her saying her boyfriend was 'actively' trying to get her pregnant for a while, because now that she is he's not excited because hes 23 and he said he wasn't planning to have a baby and basically just said she started getting crazy about it out of nowhere....... I shit you not she has been daily been sending messages EVEN AT 9 DAYS PREGNANT about having food aversions, nausea, all this stuff but then when she was worried that they didn't see anything at 8 days pregnant she admitted she hasn't had any symptoms so she was concerned that they were saying they didn't see any signs of a fetus. It's just been so weird. Every day she's been non stop and normally I would be excited to have someone to relate to but I feel like she is pushing it all so hard. I struggled so bad between weeks 6-9 and she just doesn't understand idk. I'm sure she's starting to have symptoms at 4 weeks, but every single day its something but then shes out doing a whoooooole bunch of stuff which I feel like contradicts what she says and I just find it hard to believe how authentic shes being about it all because shes just been weirding me out entirely honestly. every day she just talks about herself nonstop and will go on and on and on &amp; not pick up social cues of when to stop and sometimes its like overly detailed and TMI??? She once sent a photo of toilet paper after she wiped to show her discharge ?

We were all talking in the chat today and she of course is already just going on and on and on about how shes already created her baby registry and shes going to start sending it out and she sent it in the chat to my friend &amp; I, and she was just saying how excited she is etc and I responded saying I'm just nervous because its a complete life change and something I've obviously never done before (she hasn't either) and that i hope i will be a good mom etc and she responded this entire paragraph saying this"" sometimes being a mother isn't meant for everyone, you really have to consider if this is the right choice for you, it is going to be a life altering decision, and a addition to your life that once its here it is truly your responsibility. you are a very young girl and you already have a lot of animals, if you genuinely don't think being a mother is something your going to want to do for the next 16 years until they get their license, its okay to wait a bit longer. i don't want to stress you out but there are going to be sacrifices. this is legit the rest of your life that's going to be changed. god forbid they do a sport that you hate."" and i was honestly appalled by this message. She made me feel like i was SO out of line for saying I'm genuinely nervous to be a mother and i get anxious thinking about it sometimes. Like who are you to tell me that at all? Idk. The girl just rubs me wrong honestly. Or maybe I'm just a bitch.

My epidural never really worked the way it was supposed to and by the time my 26 hour labor (1 hour pushing) was over I could transfer myself to my own gurney. I also felt a lot of pain while pushing. 

For this baby my OB said she'd give me the epidural whenever i was ready. I opted when I was around 3-4cms. They didn't give me pitocin until the epidural was working, which was such a game changer. She did break my water before but the cervix check hurt more than that. We got the epidural placed and all was well. I started feeling my right leg though, as well as contractions on that side of my stomach, and had to tell a nurse three times before she got the anesthesiologist to come back and look at it. 

Once it was pulled back and adjusted my pain was gone. They said I could probably push if I was ready and 5 minutes later, my baby was born.

Not a big cuddler, best we get is sleeptime purring while she circles us like a hawk and begs for pets. She's mostly in our bedroom, where we plan to keep the baby stuff until we build the extra room that will hopefully serve as long term kid's room. The crib will have a breathable mesh net on top to keep her out and her litter box is hidden inside a cabinet (those nifty ones with a hole entrance just big enough for a cat that look like classic TV stands). Unless she does something totally horrible, I am not throwing her out. We will also have a portable crib for others rooms so no leaving them alone in bedroom without supervision.

I asked for an elective induction on my due date for my second pregnancy. I actually drove myself to the hospital and begged to be induced ha. They agreed (I guess labor and delivery was slow that day.) We tried a membrane sweep the week prior and nothing. I was just done being pregnant, I had a rough and painful (had to start leave from work a month earlier than expected because my hip pain was so bad I could barely walk) third trimester. Pregnancy was otherwise really healthy/ uncomplicated. Ive had one previous vaginal delivery (spontaneous labor at 39 weeks after membrane sweep). Relatively uncomplicated hospital birth (20hrs in labor, 30min pushing, second degree tear, normal recovery. I did have terrible back labor though but once I got the epidural I felt nothing).

My husband met me at the hospital and we had lunch and then walked over to L&amp;D. We got checked in and found out I was already 5cm dilated. Got started in pitocin and started having contractions. I BARELY felt the contractions though they felt like mild period cramps but could see them in the monitor. My husband and I happily hung out and watched tv for three hours (we joked it was the first date wed been on in months ha). 

After a few hours the contractions started to hurt a but more so I asked for an epidural. By the time i got the epidural they were pretty painful but i was able to breathe through it all. Epidural worked and dulled the pain a bit (not as strong as the one id had with my first delivery). Nurse checked my cervix (7cm now) and accidentally broke my water. 

I IMMEDIATELY felt the need to push/ excruciating pressure. She checked me again, lo and behold I was at 10cm. 

I pushed like 4 times and my healthy baby girl was born 8 minutes later. The midwife barely had time to get to the room. I didnt tear at all! They removed the epidural and I basically felt totally normal& 

Shockingly easy recovery, was out to lunch with friends a few days later& 

It felt like the epidural didnt work below my belly but honestly the pushing part was so fast it was fine. I also wonder if I didnt tear because I could feel everything& Anyways, I hope any future birth I may have goes exactly like this again.

Despite taking the medication and being told he might have low birth weight, my baby is measuring 3+ weeks ahead at 30 weeks (Im terrified) and in the 99th percentile for everything. I do have borderline GD but its been completely diet controlled and my numbers have been great. Hes just huge. And my belly is huge. He dropped at 29 weeks and is head down, ready to go. 

I really feel like Im gonna give birth sooner than 39 weeks (when I planned to be induced). Did anyone take Vyvanse or other ADHD stimulants during their pregnancy and give birth sooner than 39 weeks?

2025-03-14,1741954896.0,Innocently annoying ass coworker,"Hello, FTM here. My mood swings were in full swing before I even knew i was preggy. They've been getting better in my 2nd trimester, however, I have a coworker who irritates theeee shiiiiit out of me. She's actually SO NICE, but she reeks of ""desperation""... I can't think of a different or better word... of wanting to ""fit in"" &amp; be a part of every conversation... its irritating.. we are at work, I'm inquiring about something work related &amp; she manages to squeeze in a comment regarding something outside of work.. just to say it... or just to have an interaction.. and the bosses have new rules now &amp; she sarcastically brings them up, OFTEN. Like okay, jokes old already &amp; I don't want to fake laugh, just bc i feel bad.. also, she was calling my baby ""peanie"" the entire first trimester.. just a horrid nickname..not cute..and in the sonogram, baby didn't even LOOK like a peanut.. if it did, call it peanut.. not peanie... bc wth is that? I asked her to stop. My aunt also called it peanut.. I literally asked, ""where does it look like a peanut?"" ... its annoying as shit.

Anyway, back to coworker (who I've known since hs.. we are in our mid 30s now)

Examples:
1. How's peanie? Idk...... good, I hope!
2. Go eat, you're eating for two now.... no, I'm not.. and I don't eat unless I feel hungry or it's been a while since I've eaten. Even so, just bc I feel a slight twinge of hunger, doesn't mean I have to go stuff my face.
3. When im walking away from my work station, ""don't forget to clock out &amp; not waste company time.. or you'll get fired"" (jokes old already! .) - ""don't forget to clock out before you use the bathroom"" - all sarcastic joking comments, and only she's laughing.. legit laughing.. and im like.. this isn't even funny to me.. enough already.. 
4. Talking about work related shit &amp; she wants to throw in, ""we need a girl day"" . . . Or some personal stressful detail about her life, COMPLETELY irrelevant from the work related shit im talking about.. not even a conversation starter, just legit one sentence. One comment. Just to say it.
5. Talking about food and how hungry she is ALL THE TIME and then comments about how good the food was or how bad it messed up her belly.. comments on it FOR HOURS throughout the workday.. I've turned into a ""that's crazy"" person.... &amp; a ""don't make eye contact"" person, otherwise, she's blurting out ""those empanadas were so good.. I want more"" ..... SO GET THEM! It's like why do you have to say something every single time i face your direction? Like idc!
6. I had a browning banana on my desk and she tells me, ""you better eat that before it goes bad.."" - I said i will if I want it, but if it goes bad, I'll toss it. I'm not afraid to throw food away if i need to.. I'm not a food hoarder and I don't eat every single moment I'm hungry or just bc food is in front of me. 
7. She thinks just bc I'm pregnant I'm supposed to be eating like a cow... I was telling her something about me and my bf eating and she inquires about my bf, ""he eats as much as you?""  - B%#$* !! first of all, I'm not heavy. I love my body, I think I'm pretty =% hot, &amp; I feel good about myself in a world where what we see online can make us feel like pure shit. Even if i was heavy, juicy,.... a voluptuous woman.. id still feel sexy. however, I do not look like I overeat.. at all. So that comment implies that just bc I'm expecting, I eat more than my 5""11 190lb weight lifting BF !? I can barely eat with all of my food aversions. I'm 5'3, always bloated in belly (prior to pregnancy) due to PCOS.. but to say that shit...  my blood boiled. The assumptions are crazy annoying. Just bc im pregnant, you're simply going to assume i cant control my food intake. Wth. 
8. She suffers from anxiety, I'm someone who worries here and there, has fears, like anyone else... especially as a FTM and possible complications etc. I was so nervous in the beginning of this pregnancy... and so she would make comments like, ""people like us"" or ""you know how our mind works"" ... associating me with an anxiety disorder. It's like she took my valid ass fears or worries.. and moments* of anxiety... to compare to HER &amp; associates with anxiety
9. Tells my worker (who trusts my pallet) that as long as she sits next to me, she's going to gain weight. (Again, not bc I'm heavy.. she just think bc I'm pregnant, I eat like a savage) mind you I have 2 meals a day bc so many food thoughts turn me off.) You're not about to blame me for my food recommendations*** &amp; if someone chooses to eat it.. and gains weight, ""blame her"" .. you're not cute or funny. Bc what you're saying isn't even true! If it were true, it wouldn't bother me.

All this shit IRKS me &amp; I can't control the annoyed feelings.

I was diagnosed with a short cervix and SCH almost a week ago after having lots of pink and brown discharge/mucus with blood clots along with some mild cramping. I went to the ER (mind you this was my third doctor visit in a week to find out whats wrong.) They spotted a SCH that had some blood and debri, they assured me that was where the extra nasty discharge was probably coming from. They told me that should pass on its own. They then noticed how short my cervix was. It was at a 2.3-2.5. They kept me overnight with the TOCO machine to spot any early contractions and had me on progesterone all night to see if it helped. The high risk doctor measured my cervix the next morning and it was a 3.1. He was more confident that things were better but still wanted to follow up in a few days to check on things. They prescribed me progesterone and Ive been on it for 5 days now. I went back to the doctor today for a follow up. My cervix is measuring at 1. They are assuming the progesterone wasnt doing so well and are highly suggesting a cerclage. Ive took it very easy the past few days and missed a bunch of work and been on bed rest (my decision.) Im not sure what caused the cervix to get that bad so quickly. Im going to be admitted again tonight. They are going to put me back on the toco machine to check for contractions and put me on more medication tonight to prepare for surgery tomorrow. God willing. The doctor told me she has seen a lot of success with cerclages but she has also been there for cases that still had a bad outcome where they went into pre term labor and couldnt stop it regardless of the cerclage. She made sure I knew that if that were the case, the baby wouldnt survive and at this point they are definitely concerned of that happening. They are going to do anything preventative they can.

Im not making excuses for myself but am wrecked with guilt about how difficult it was for me to quit weed altogether out of the fear of withdrawals. 

I found out at 5 weeks and immediately stopped smoking - HOWEVER, the absolute torture that is insomnia from weed withdrawals is one of my greater fears (from past quitting experiences) so I bought low concentration THC pills from a dispensary. 

From weeks 5-10 I tapered from 10mg pills to 2mg and stopped from there. My tolerance was so jacked up that 10mg did nothing for me so to be clear I have never been high while pregnant I was honest to god just terrified of the sleepless nights &amp; my ability to function at my full time job (where if you make mistakes its a very big deal). 

This pregnancy was so not planned and I feel so fucking guilty and concerned that I was selfish enough to not just suffer through however many sleepless nights I needed to to safeguard this babys development. 

It doesnt help that so many people tell me I know all kinds of women who smoked through their pregnancy and their kids turned out fine!!! They been said their doctors even recommended it&.

In your experience, is it worth it, does it increase stress and costs unnecessarily, and does it push for interventions that aren't needed/scans that end up getting false positives? 

I'm labeled high risk at 39 as a FTM who conceived through IVF (unexplained, but very likely cervical issues). I agreed to MFM care in my first trimester because I was struggling with anxiety and happy for any additional assuring appointments. But at 22 weeks, anxiety is gone and everything is going perfectly with me and baby. I have a baby echocardiogram scheduled for 3 weeks from now, and apparently I'd start to see MFM every 2 weeks (!!) not long after that, in addition to all my OB appointments. 

I spoke with my normal GP today, who specializes in women's reproductive health, and she strongly recommended I consider bowing out of MFM care. This is given my zero indicated risk and the high likelihood that they would induce me (they told me they'd induce me before my due date) and overall push for scans and tests that often give false positives. 

She said MFM really pushes for babies to be born alive and early (pushing induction) vs. thinking about the baby's overall start in life (being able to nurse, breathe well, fight infection, etc). She sees the difference in newborn response and overall health whereas MFM and OB don't treat babies after birth, and the differences she sees between babies born 36-39 weeks vs. 40-41 weeks (especially for healthy women who eat, move, and have supportive communities) is huge. 

It's got me thinking! Anyone else avoid MFM or even extra OB intervention to avoid induction or being pressured toward induction (or just lots of expensive appointments/scans that aren't needed)?

Im having my c section in 7 days and Im excited. But my excitement about meeting my baby has totally been eradicated by this overwhelming expectation of my life turning into a shit show, and I feel extremely naive to be excited about the baby. I feel like everyone in my family, who are here to be supportive and have even moved in temporarily to help take care of me and the baby; while also  laughing at me and oh you have no idea whats going to happen to your life . My husband has already previously had a child 20 years ago with his ex wife and delights in telling me how shit everything will be and what a shock I will get. 

For example: I mentioned I wanted to put out a couple of outdoor pot plants in the spring. My mum and husband quickly jumped on top of me saying I have zero chance of doing that and I wont ever be able to do anything like that ever again and just to forget ideas like having like even a couple of outdoor plants& keeping in mind Im taking 12 Months off work. We are going to be 4 adults in the house with 1 newborn, 3 adults not working. Are you serious that none of us is ever going to be able to even wipe our own ass anymore?

2025-03-13,1741899475.0,"Newly pregnant after TTC for a year, an ectopic, and diagnosed infertility","I guess I need somewhere to spill my news of excitement and anxiety. 

My husband and I decided to TTC last year this month and we got pregnant in July, only for it to end with an ectopic pregnancy rupturing and I lost my right fallopian tube. I was diagnosed with stage 3 endometriosis during this surgery (which I never knew I had) and it had eaten through my entire fallopian tube, causing the ectopic. It was covering my ovaries and all over my insides. After my ectopic, we continued TTC with times sex and using LH strips and BBT monitoring. 

After my ectopic, I started having really short luteal phases (7-8 days) several months in a row. After pushing my OBGYN, they finally decided to run CD21 progesterone labs and discovered that my progesterone was too low to confirm ovulation each month. They tested me three months in a row and confirmed I had stopped ovulating on my own. That combined with my stage 3 endo diagnosis, I was diagnosed with infertility. 

In January, they did an endometriosis excision surgery and found that my other tube was completely clear (yay!). They ran progesterone labs again the following month and I still was not ovulating. They decided to put me on Letrozole 5mg. 

I hit one year TTC this month and my husband and I took a trip to France. I didnt have my hopes high because Im so used to disappointment and seeing negatives, but the night I got home, on 10DPO, I got a positive. 

I immediately took a digital and it came back positive too. I cant believe my first cycle on 5mg Letrozole actually worked!! I am cautiously excited because the protocol following an ectopic is to get bloodwork every 48 hours until I can get a 6 week placement scan to ensure it is not ectopic again. I have started my bloodwork and my 6 week appointment is scheduled. 

I am terrified of losing this baby that we have tried for for so long. I am waiting for the other shoe to drop and I cant help but feel terrified that this baby wont make it, despite really healthy first bloodwork.

Im currently 9 weeks and 4 days pregnant with my first baby. After my first prenatal appointment, I received unexpected news from my employer that we need to return to the office after nearly three years of working remotely. I was devastated because I had hoped to work from home during my pregnancy and through my babys first year, but here we are.

I spoke with my doctor about it, and she gave me some great advice to make the transition easier, like treating myself to lunch nearby, listening to my favorite podcast on the commute, and finding small ways to make the experience more pleasant. That helped me mentally prepare, but Im still struggling with first-trimester fatigue, sleepiness, food aversions, and all the fun symptoms that come with early pregnancy. I have been told things get better in the second trimester, so Im hopeful.

Now, I have the option to work either:

* 5 days a week, 8 hours a day
* 4 days a week, 10 hours a day with 3-day weekends

I would love to hear from others who have worked a flex schedule while pregnant. For context, I'm a software developer. My commute would be 45 - 60 minutes. Would working four longer days be worth it for the extra day off, or would the longer shifts be too exhausting? I understand that everyone is different and experiences may vary. I'd still love to learn about others' experiences or any advice especially if you've been in this exact situation.

I plan on talking to my doctor tomorrow but I am struggling with my anxiety. 

I am currently 20w along with my second pregnancy. 

I first was great till the birth. Had him at 39+4 and he was semi big at 8lb 1oz. He also was sunny side up (nose facing my pelvis vs nose facing tail bone like normal) And for anyone that doesn't know that means that the widest part of the baby head is coming out first instead of the cone part of the head which is made to come out first. 

Him being born in that position caused me to tear in 3 locations all needing stitches and all VERY painful. I had the Epidural for my labor which also was a very long process for me as well but it only semi worked. i could feel contraction pain in my tail bone and my left butt cheek... they of course turned it off for the pushing part which lasted 2 1/2 hours for me. 

During my birth i was crying and saying i couldn't handle it anymore, i was in so much pain i wanted to quit. which i technically did as i stopped pushing myself though my body still naturally pushed and they had to help pull him out of me once his head came out. 

I feel as though I'm sort of traumatized and I'm having so much anxiety about giving birth again. I've told my husband that I am considering a C section as the cons of a c section sound way more worth it to me than going through a 24 hour labor, and 2+ plus hours of pushing and feeling like I'm giving up. 

I am aware a C section has a several month healing process, I'm aware of how the procedure works. What I maybe want is hearing other peoples experience.

I had been on birth control for 20 ish years and stopped taking my pill around Christmas time. I had my regular withdraw bleed on Jan 2. My husband and I both assumed it would take 3-6 months for my body to regulate and start normal cycles again. Towards the very end of January I started to feel like I was about to start my period but never did. This feeling lasted 2-3 weeks, no period, but I tested very positive on Feb 23.

I called my dr and we went to our first appointment yesterday. He seemed quite discouraged, and said that our baby was only measuring about 5-6 weeks when he felt it should be closer to 8-9. He was not able to detect a heartbeat, but has scheduled us to come back in on the 24th for a repeat ultra sound. 

This is our first baby, so we arent sure what to expect or think. I am convinced that I ovulated at the very end of January/early February, we werent really trying yet so I have to admit I wasnt tracking anything. Im just going by the clear stringing stuff that was coming out of me = sorry if TMI, but it was def the egg white discharge

 My honest feelings are telling me they are going off my last period which wasnt even a period to assume how far along we should be - which I just dont think is accurate. I feel like the 5-6 week mark is correct, in which case our baby is right on track. I have had 0 spotting this entire time btw.

What are the chances of seeing a heartbeat at that stage through a vaginal ultra sound? Should we be worried or does this sound okay? I know the worst thing to do is stress, just wondering if there is anything else I could be doing to find out if everything is going as it should be??

Some insight on our housing - we rented a house with a roommate last July as we had no idea that we would be having a baby this year- our roommate left to the military a month back and we are just struggling in general to keep everything up before our lease ends in July. (My birth month). I want to move to my parents asap but I am still working and do not want to quit because then I won't get my maternity leave. (I am in California). Are there any benefits I can apply to in my situation? Would I qualify for unemployment due to relocation needs + being pregnant?  or try to get Maternity leave early? So we can at least be able to pay our car insurance, car payment, phone bills, etc bills while we move to my parents? I fear 1 paycheck (my husbands) will not be able to cover all our expenses. If anyone has any tips/advice I would greatly appreciate it.",pregnant,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1janxz6/23_weeks_pregnant_and_needing_to_move_but_if_i/

We started designing my engagement ring late November of last year (my ring just finished production yesterday and I cannot wait to pick it up this weekend hehe). We unexpectedly fell pregnant and are super excited to enter the next chapter of our lives as parents, but we also had plans for our engagement/elopement this year. We both agreed that we should move forward with the engagement/elopement before baby comes. However I need some advice or would love to hear your experience of wedding/eloping while pregnant. My plan is to wait until late June/July to elope to give us time to plan, I should be around 20-25 or so weeks pregnant at that time.

Some backstory, we are recent friends. Less than a year. We started hanging out because we have daughters around the same age and have similar interests. She has started to confide in me about her own infertility journey pretty recently into our friendship, maybe around 4 or 5 months ago. She recently had her first failed round of IVF, that she said she was disappointed but not surprised by because she has had so many losses in the past. All of her fertilized eggs are boys and she has also talked about how she has been worried about having a boy after wanting a sister for her daughter. 

Im currently pregnant with my third child and its a boy and I havent told her. I havent seen her in about a month but we have been hanging out while Ive been pregnant and Ive worn baggy clothes all winter. Ive been very very depressed this whole pregnancy. I just barely told my family a month ago (meaning they eventually told me they could tell I was pregnant and so I had to fess up that I am). I told a different friend only a few weeks ago also because I couldnt hide my belly anymore. I only told my extended family last week. I understand people closer to me may feel like I was withholding something from them or feel awkward about the times we have spent together and them not knowing Im pregnant, but Ive truly been so very depressed this whole time, crying myself to sleep and contacting the suicide hotline multiple times. Which has honestly made me feel worse because I have this friend who is trying so hard to have another baby and here I am being depressed while pregnant.

I want to see this friend again but I have no idea how to tell her now. She just barely had her first failed round of her boy embryo and is trying again next month. Im worried I messed up by not telling her earlier, but I also hadnt told a single soul until very recently.

2025-03-14,1741912716.0,Pregnant to my ex,"So I found out I was pregnant about a week after my ex broke up with me.  I use the term ex very loosely as we had only been together about 3 months.
I told him I was pregnant and was keeping the baby, I have a decent paying job and expected to have a good support network around. It was his choice if he wanted to be involved. He said he would support my decision and be there for me. 

Fast forward to now Im currently 16 weeks pregnant, I have a few friends that are supportive (but have their own lives)and baby dad who was doing what he could until the past couple weeks. My family have said Im being selfish (very old fashioned and think Im crazy doing it alone) and havent been supportive at all. I have basically cut them out at this point. 

I was heavily relying on my ex for both emotional support but also just to make me feel less lonely. Its not been an easy pregnancy so far and Im high risk, Ive had to have him come over a few times at the advice of midwives. I know he has his own life to lead and hes said himself he cant be there 24/7 but does want to be involved, then backed off about 2/3 weeks ago. I have reached out but was brushed off, again it was a me problem, but if Im not healthy then baby isnt safe. He has been there when the midwives have advised me to take it easy and knows how high risk I am. I have been signed off work too. How much is too much to expect ?  Im really struggling both physically and mentally with the pregnancy. I also want to build a friendship with him so we can coparent to the best of our ability. I want to be comfortable around him for the birth but also afterwards. I dont think Ill want a practical stranger around me when Im in labour or even in the weeks/months following the birth. 
The fact he is aware that hes the only person I really have right now but is stepping away is also making me think will he do this to the baby.  Can I really trust him to be the best dad. I just want to build a friendship now, maybe initially I thought we could work on us but not now. 

For reference were late 30s early 40s he already has older children (young adults) this is my first but had previous miscarriages. I am financially stable enough to do it alone but just struggling with everything and him having stepped back Im feeling completely isolated. As I said I do have friends I can rely on but they have their own lives (jobs/kids/families etc)

Is it unreasonable to expect baby dad to be involved with me throughout the pregnancy?  Am I expecting too much to build a friendship or even expect him to support me right now?  I dont feel comfortable having him at the appts now or even asking for support when I had a scare. Baby seems to be ok its me thats not doing great. 

We got into a huge fight when I told him that I didnt want him to come along to my next appt and that from now on I was going to do it alone. I would just inform him of updates if there was issues.  That if he couldnt offer the support I needed then we would have to reassess his coming along and also the birth and beyond. I would honestly rather be alone than have him around right now. He just said theres no reason for us to be friends but he does want to know and be there for appts. He isnt getting my view that its my body and if I feel like he will be a stranger then it will be me who decides when he can visit and when he can attend the appts or hospital after birth.

2025-03-14,1741936242.0,CMV: Sleep training is ultimately a choice to prioritize sleep needs (and sometimes convenience) over the emotional needs of the baby (at night) and necessarily involves deprioritising a babys distress at night in a way that most people would call at least somewhat negligent if done in the day.,"I've thought a lot about this, and the more I think about it the harder I find it to make sense of an apparent contradiction or tension in the arguments of those in favour of popular forms of sleep training.

If responding quickly and lovingly to a child's distress in the day is important, why is it somehow less important just because the sun is down?

After all, it's nearly universally agreed upon that we should not completely ignore our child's fear, anxiety or emotional distress. Doing so we term negligence. This is still true even if we start by ignoring our child's distress for 5 minutes and gradually increase the duration over time until we ignore their cries completely. Why is it okay to do this at night?",changemyview,76.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jay4cq/cmv_sleep_training_is_ultimately_a_choice_to/
2025-03-14,1741963333.0,Positive MA experience - 10w 0d,"Using a throwaway for this one just in case. Although every MA is different, I want to share my story in hopes it will help others in a similar situation.

I discovered I was pregnant on Feb 26th; I'd had what I thought was a light period on January 29th-30th-31st, but it turns out that must have been implantation bleeding. I thought I was only 10 days late for my period based on the timing of that bleed, but it turns out I was much further along. I hadn't had many symptoms except for very sore breasts, some tiredness and loss of appetite, all of which I tend to get before my cycle anyway, so I didn't clue in right away.

I'm in a solid, loving relationship, but we just aren't currently in a situation to add to our family. I have a young child from my previous relationship, and we live in a fairly modest apartment, and for many other reasons it just wouldn't be right to add to the family right now. 

I was a bit panicked when I found out I was pregnant, but my partner was incredibly supportive and understanding. I called my doctor the same day and was referred to our local hospital which has a program for women seeking termination. My partner brought me to the appointment, which was on Wednesday of this week. I'm based in Canada and so it was a very calm and non-judgmental environment; I'm grateful to the doctor and nurse who walked me through my options and explained everything to me.

I was given an ultrasound and blood test the same day and they determined I was at exactly 10 weeks and 0 days, the cutoff for using medical termination in my province. They mentioned I could either schedule a surgical termination for the following week, or do the medical termination as long as I was willing to take the first pill that day. I decided on the medical because I wanted to end the pregnancy as soon as possible - my last pregnancy and birth process were extremely traumatic, and being pregnant again was giving me nightmares and flashbacks, so I couldn't handle the thought of waiting any longer.

Timeline:

6:00 pm Wednesday: took the mifepristone dose as directed. Had some very mild cramping starting about two hours later, which continued the following day.

1:00 pm Thursday: developed a headache, had some additional cramping and mildly upset stomach through the rest of the afternoon.

6:00 pm: took 10 mg ketorolac with a small amount of food.

6:45 pm: took 4 Misoprostol tablets in the cheek for 30 minutes as directed, washed down with water afterwards.

9:00 pm: started having some mild cramping which came in waves, slight chills. Very mild nausea which didn't last. Watched TV with partner and just tried to relax.

10:00 pm: started having some light spotting, cramps continuing. Cramps felt like my worst period day, nothing too major. Chills and started to have diarrhea.

10:45 pm: listened to an audiobook and went to sleep.

11:30 pm: woke up to a strange sensation, felt almost like my hands weren't attached to my body. Felt something shift in my lower abdomen, then a rush of fluid. Fortunately I was wearing heavy duty period undies in addition to a pad already and had no leakage. Went to the bathroom expecting pure blood but discovered it was pink tinted fluid which I assume was water breaking. Pad completely saturated. Pain very minimal.

As soon as I sat down on the toilet I felt something drop out. Had the sensation of needing to push, did so and a much larger clump came rushing out, along with quite a bit of blood. Peeked into the toilet and could see a ring shaped clot, and noticed a light pink thing partially submerged in the blood. It was not pleasant to see and I could tell it was part of a leg/lower torso of the embryo, extremely small but unmistakable.

Had a bit of a cry. Said I was sorry. Remembered what some of the other women have said on here about their babies becoming part of the water. I did not want to be pregnant, but I couldn't help but have feelings about it. I stayed for a while before saying goodbye and flushing.

1:30 am: woke up again, mild cramping and passed some more clots. Took a second ketorolac. Came back to bed and fell asleep easily.

6:00 am: woke up at my normal time, immediately felt different than I'd been feeling for the last few weeks. Breasts still a little sore but pain noticeably reduced from how they had been feeling prior. Did not have the morning upset stomach, and was able to enjoy a coffee (I'd been having aversion to it for about three weeks). Actually had energy as opposed to feeling extremely fatigued. Had moderate amount of blood on the pad and a few tiny clots when going to the bathroom, similar to a day 2 period.

10:30 am (present): cramps have almost completely subsided, have not needed more ketorolac. Ate some breakfast. Still have what is similar to a day 2 period. Energy is much higher than it normally is at this time of the morning.

I will still need to monitor for unusual bleeding, signs of infection, or increasing pain, and will need a follow up to confirm everything has passed, but ultimately the process was not what I expected. I originally worried that 4 Misoprostol wouldn't be sufficient, given that I was 10 weeks along and I've seen stories on here of women needing double the dose. I was worried it wasn't working initially as it took quite some time for the bleeding to start.

For anyone facing this situation right now: just know that you aren't alone. You are doing what is best for your body, and if you aren't ready to give up everything for a baby it means you're doing the right thing for your baby too.

2025-03-14,1741923219.0,How to tell friend going through secondary infertility that I am 6 months pregnant?,"Im really worried that I am going to lose the friendship and I made a big mistake.

Some backstory, we are recent friends. Less than a year. We started hanging out because we have daughters around the same age and have similar interests. She has started to confide in me about her own infertility journey pretty recently into our friendship, maybe around 4 or 5 months ago. She recently had her first failed round of IVF, that she said she was disappointed but not surprised by because she has had so many losses in the past. All of her fertilized eggs are boys and she has also talked about how she has been worried about having a boy after wanting a sister for her daughter. 

Im currently pregnant with my third child and its a boy and I havent told her. I havent seen her in about a month but we have been hanging out while Ive been pregnant and Ive worn baggy clothes all winter. Ive been very very depressed this whole pregnancy. I just barely told my family a month ago (meaning they eventually told me they could tell I was pregnant and so I had to fess up that I am). I told a different friend only a few weeks ago also because I couldnt hide my belly anymore. I only told my extended family last week. I understand people closer to me may feel like I was withholding something from them or feel awkward about the times we have spent together and them not knowing Im pregnant, but Ive truly been so very depressed this whole time, crying myself to sleep and contacting the suicide hotline multiple times. Which has honestly made me feel worse because I have this friend who is trying so hard to have another baby and here I am being depressed while pregnant.

I want to see this friend again but I have no idea how to tell her now. She just barely had her first failed round of her boy embryo and is trying again next month. Im worried I messed up by not telling her earlier, but I also hadnt told a single soul until very recently.

I asked for an elective induction on my due date for my second pregnancy. I actually drove myself to the hospital and begged to be induced ha. They agreed (I guess labor and delivery was slow that day.) We tried a membrane sweep the week prior and nothing. I was just done being pregnant, I had a rough and painful (had to start leave from work a month earlier than expected because my hip pain was so bad I could barely walk) third trimester. Pregnancy was otherwise really healthy/ uncomplicated. Ive had one previous vaginal delivery (spontaneous labor at 39 weeks after membrane sweep). Relatively uncomplicated hospital birth (20hrs in labor, 30min pushing, second degree tear, normal recovery. I did have terrible back labor though but once I got the epidural I felt nothing).

My husband met me at the hospital and we had lunch and then walked over to L&amp;D. We got checked in and found out I was already 5cm dilated. Got started in pitocin and started having contractions. I BARELY felt the contractions though they felt like mild period cramps but could see them in the monitor. My husband and I happily hung out and watched tv for three hours (we joked it was the first date wed been on in months ha). 

After a few hours the contractions started to hurt a but more so I asked for an epidural. By the time i got the epidural they were pretty painful but i was able to breathe through it all. Epidural worked and dulled the pain a bit (not as strong as the one id had with my first delivery). Nurse checked my cervix (7cm now) and accidentally broke my water. 

I IMMEDIATELY felt the need to push/ excruciating pressure. She checked me again, lo and behold I was at 10cm. 

I pushed like 4 times and my healthy baby girl was born 8 minutes later. The midwife barely had time to get to the room. I didnt tear at all! They removed the epidural and I basically felt totally normal& 

Shockingly easy recovery, was out to lunch with friends a few days later& 

It felt like the epidural didnt work below my belly but honestly the pushing part was so fast it was fine.

Everything came back normal except for marginal cord placement. Meaning that the umbilical cord is placed at the side of the placenta instead of the middle. The OB I saw after the scan said that once I'm in my 3rd trimester, I'll be needing ultrasounds every 3 to 4 weeks to watch for IUGR. I am a high anxiety individual (I am seeing a psychotherapist &amp; trying to find an SSRI that works for me during pregnancy rn, but I don't see her again till the 24th), so I have started freaking out. I wanted to try having spontaneous labor and try birthing natural. And if I have IUGR, I obviously will have to let that dream go. This is my first ever pregnancy, and everyone around me doesn't seem too worried about it when it's all I can think about half of the time. Has anyone had marginal placement and NOT had IUGR? Or has anyone been in my shoes and gotten IUGR who has some words of advice to ease my crippling anxiety??

2025-03-14,1741954896.0,Innocently annoying ass coworker,"Hello, FTM here. My mood swings were in full swing before I even knew i was preggy. They've been getting better in my 2nd trimester, however, I have a coworker who irritates theeee shiiiiit out of me. She's actually SO NICE, but she reeks of ""desperation""... I can't think of a different or better word... of wanting to ""fit in"" &amp; be a part of every conversation... its irritating.. we are at work, I'm inquiring about something work related &amp; she manages to squeeze in a comment regarding something outside of work.. just to say it... or just to have an interaction.. and the bosses have new rules now &amp; she sarcastically brings them up, OFTEN. Like okay, jokes old already &amp; I don't want to fake laugh, just bc i feel bad.. also, she was calling my baby ""peanie"" the entire first trimester.. just a horrid nickname..not cute..and in the sonogram, baby didn't even LOOK like a peanut.. if it did, call it peanut.. not peanie... bc wth is that? I asked her to stop. My aunt also called it peanut.. I literally asked, ""where does it look like a peanut?"" ... its annoying as shit.

Anyway, back to coworker (who I've known since hs.. we are in our mid 30s now)

Examples:
1. How's peanie? Idk...... good, I hope!
2. Go eat, you're eating for two now.... no, I'm not.. and I don't eat unless I feel hungry or it's been a while since I've eaten. Even so, just bc I feel a slight twinge of hunger, doesn't mean I have to go stuff my face.
3. When im walking away from my work station, ""don't forget to clock out &amp; not waste company time.. or you'll get fired"" (jokes old already! .) - ""don't forget to clock out before you use the bathroom"" - all sarcastic joking comments, and only she's laughing.. legit laughing.. and im like.. this isn't even funny to me.. enough already.. 
4. Talking about work related shit &amp; she wants to throw in, ""we need a girl day"" . . . Or some personal stressful detail about her life, COMPLETELY irrelevant from the work related shit im talking about.. not even a conversation starter, just legit one sentence. One comment. Just to say it.
5. Talking about food and how hungry she is ALL THE TIME and then comments about how good the food was or how bad it messed up her belly.. comments on it FOR HOURS throughout the workday.. I've turned into a ""that's crazy"" person.... &amp; a ""don't make eye contact"" person, otherwise, she's blurting out ""those empanadas were so good.. I want more"" ..... SO GET THEM! It's like why do you have to say something every single time i face your direction? Like idc!
6. I had a browning banana on my desk and she tells me, ""you better eat that before it goes bad.."" - I said i will if I want it, but if it goes bad, I'll toss it. I'm not afraid to throw food away if i need to.. I'm not a food hoarder and I don't eat every single moment I'm hungry or just bc food is in front of me. 
7. She thinks just bc I'm pregnant I'm supposed to be eating like a cow... I was telling her something about me and my bf eating and she inquires about my bf, ""he eats as much as you?""  - B%#$* !! first of all, I'm not heavy. I love my body, I think I'm pretty =% hot, &amp; I feel good about myself in a world where what we see online can make us feel like pure shit. Even if i was heavy, juicy,.... a voluptuous woman.. id still feel sexy. however, I do not look like I overeat.. at all. So that comment implies that just bc I'm expecting, I eat more than my 5""11 190lb weight lifting BF !? I can barely eat with all of my food aversions. I'm 5'3, always bloated in belly (prior to pregnancy) due to PCOS.. but to say that shit...  my blood boiled. The assumptions are crazy annoying. Just bc im pregnant, you're simply going to assume i cant control my food intake. Wth. 
8. She suffers from anxiety, I'm someone who worries here and there, has fears, like anyone else... especially as a FTM and possible complications etc. I was so nervous in the beginning of this pregnancy... and so she would make comments like, ""people like us"" or ""you know how our mind works"" ... associating me with an anxiety disorder. It's like she took my valid ass fears or worries.. and moments* of anxiety... to compare to HER &amp; associates with anxiety
9. Tells my worker (who trusts my pallet) that as long as she sits next to me, she's going to gain weight. (Again, not bc I'm heavy.. she just think bc I'm pregnant, I eat like a savage) mind you I have 2 meals a day bc so many food thoughts turn me off.) You're not about to blame me for my food recommendations*** &amp; if someone chooses to eat it.. and gains weight, ""blame her"" .. you're not cute or funny. Bc what you're saying isn't even true! If it were true, it wouldn't bother me.

All this shit IRKS me &amp; I can't control the annoyed feelings.

I had a loss in October and even though I DESPERATELY wanted a girl, I found out it was a boy. Sadly it ended in loss in my second trimester (doctors suspect he had heart failure). The strange thing is even if I wanted a girl, I dreamt of a baby boy that was almost sickly in all my dreams. Its strange how accurate that was. He was never very active in my ultrasounds and was always sort of slumped over not looking well.

This time I want a boy due to my loss, but Im having dreams of a girl. More specifically a girl thats really lively, talks back to me, and doesnt listen =C And when I punish her she laughs at me. I got an ultrasound a couple days later after the dream and sure enough this kid is bouncing and wiggling everywhere =, Its cute, but I feel like the personality is going to be accurate. Its a lot more lively than my previous baby was.

My mom has been convinced since I was a child that if I ever have a child Ill only have one (shes right with that because I decided one and done) and itd be a boy. So far she hasnt been wrong with any of her grandkids so I feel like the odds are its a boy, but my gut and dreams are saying its a girl this time = Partner has 2 boys only from a previous marriage and the third would have also been a boy, so what are the odds?

Im currently 9 weeks and 4 days pregnant with my first baby. After my first prenatal appointment, I received unexpected news from my employer that we need to return to the office after nearly three years of working remotely. I was devastated because I had hoped to work from home during my pregnancy and through my babys first year, but here we are.

I spoke with my doctor about it, and she gave me some great advice to make the transition easier, like treating myself to lunch nearby, listening to my favorite podcast on the commute, and finding small ways to make the experience more pleasant. That helped me mentally prepare, but Im still struggling with first-trimester fatigue, sleepiness, food aversions, and all the fun symptoms that come with early pregnancy. I have been told things get better in the second trimester, so Im hopeful.

Now, I have the option to work either:

* 5 days a week, 8 hours a day
* 4 days a week, 10 hours a day with 3-day weekends

I would love to hear from others who have worked a flex schedule while pregnant. For context, I'm a software developer. My commute would be 45 - 60 minutes. Would working four longer days be worth it for the extra day off, or would the longer shifts be too exhausting? I understand that everyone is different and experiences may vary. I'd still love to learn about others' experiences or any advice especially if you've been in this exact situation.

2025-03-13,1741905218.0,Slight body image meltdown,"Let me start off by saying that this is an IVF pregnancy after years of trying, failed transfers, and early losses; Im over the moon to be pregnant and dont want to come off as ungrateful. Just having a rough day.

Im almost 15 weeks now, so still pretty early in the grand scheme of things, and Im really struggling with my body. 

Im 57 and my comfortable weight when Im eating well and working out is around 135 (Im small framed and dont carry much muscle, so this is not too thin on me). The constant hormones and stress of IVF bumped me up to 145 prior to this pregnancy. 

Now Im fresh into the second trimester and have already gained another 10 pounds. As of this morning, Im 155. My appetite has definitely increased and Im not depriving myself. 

I feel like I dont look pregnant, just chubby and I feel frumpy. My bump is not prominent yet and just looks like extra belly fat (and some of it definitely is=). My arms, hips, thighs, and boobs have already grown a lot too. None of my clothes fit me right now and nothing I try on makes me feel good.

Ill circle back to state that I am SO grateful to finally be pregnant. If it takes me gaining 100 pounds to bring this baby into the world, I absolutely will. But Im just not feeling like myself. 

Is anyone else feeling the same? When did your clothes start to not fit you anymore?

2025-03-14,1741964366.0,"Should I break up with MFM? (Labeled ""high risk"" because of IVF and 39, but textbook pregnancy so far)","Curious for this group's thoughts on MFM. In your experience, is it worth it, does it increase stress and costs unnecessarily, and does it push for interventions that aren't needed/scans that end up getting false positives? 

I'm labeled high risk at 39 as a FTM who conceived through IVF (unexplained, but very likely cervical issues). I agreed to MFM care in my first trimester because I was struggling with anxiety and happy for any additional assuring appointments. But at 22 weeks, anxiety is gone and everything is going perfectly with me and baby. I have a baby echocardiogram scheduled for 3 weeks from now, and apparently I'd start to see MFM every 2 weeks (!!) not long after that, in addition to all my OB appointments. 

I spoke with my normal GP today, who specializes in women's reproductive health, and she strongly recommended I consider bowing out of MFM care. This is given my zero indicated risk and the high likelihood that they would induce me (they told me they'd induce me before my due date) and overall push for scans and tests that often give false positives. 

She said MFM really pushes for babies to be born alive and early (pushing induction) vs. thinking about the baby's overall start in life (being able to nurse, breathe well, fight infection, etc). She sees the difference in newborn response and overall health whereas MFM and OB don't treat babies after birth, and the differences she sees between babies born 36-39 weeks vs. 40-41 weeks (especially for healthy women who eat, move, and have supportive communities) is huge. 

It's got me thinking! Anyone else avoid MFM or even extra OB intervention to avoid induction or being pressured toward induction (or just lots of expensive appointments/scans that aren't needed)?

2025-03-13,1741895127.0,Symptoms literally ALL. OVER. THE. PLACE.,"Alright, y'all -- I'm pregnant for the third time (7 weeks 1 day today) and let me tell you, my symptoms are ALL. OVER. THE. PLACE. 

My previous two pregnancies were both so textbook-like: nausea and super crazy exhaustion starting in 1st trimester, both symptoms pretty much gone near the end of 1st trimester. Not much craziness for symptoms besides that. Both pregnancies previously were boys (now 3 &amp; 5 years old). The only main difference is that with my first pregnancy, my morning sickness wore off each day around dinner time (what a blessing!), but with my second pregnancy, I was pretty much just nauseous 24/7. =.=¨

But this pregnancy?? This pregnancy... I'm sometimes tired, sometimes EXHAUSTED, sometimes nauseous, random times of day it comes and goes, also random pains and cramps at different parts of my abdomen (mostly on the right but occasionally on the left) that also come and go...just...!? And earlier on it was lots of bloating and constipation and gas and sometimes also heartburn and now I also get bursts of mom rage but really I just feel SO all over the place. =

People I've talked to are like ""oh, it's a girl"" = which maybe it is since my boy pregnancies were both so similar and predictable but this one is so all over the place and unpredictable so far. I know you can't really predict that, but I can't help but laugh at how many people have said that to me?! Like, what?? Haha.

Also my sister had fraternal twins during her 3rd pregnancy and I'm 34 and in my 3rd pregnancy so I can't help but wonder if I'm having twins?! I'll find out next week at my first checkup (just 6 more days!) but it's definitely been on my mind.

Not looking for predictions or anything, mostly just wondering there are any other mamas out there who have had similar situations, with crazy symptoms all over the place? Even if you haven't been pregnant before your current pregnancy. Maybe this can just be a safe place for us to rant about symptoms being so random, unpredictable, and all over the place. >à

My wife (26) and I (27M) just found out we are pregnant.

We have now known for 3 days and each have only told one person. We are waiting until Mothers Day to tell our families as that would be the end of the first trimester and we dont want to jinx anything considering how long and hard the process has been, but now for the problem.

If I just stop drinking without proudly explaining why, they will know something is up and likely deduce the news. Since my wife obviously cant drink Im not drinking as well. Has anyone else dealt with this issue before and have any tips? We really dont want the news to get out early, as much as we both want to shout it from the rooftops, I just dont know how to throw them off the trail as we have multiple birthdays and a college graduation coming up where alcohol will be flowing.

2025-03-13,1741906245.0,Deciding between MA or SA. Keeping the abortion a secret. Help?,"Hi there. I am currently deciding between an MA or SA. I do not know how far along I am ( I am about to make an appointment at PP for next week) but Im guessing I am around 8-9 weeks. Unfortunately, I have to lie and say that I am having a miscarriage. There is more info below on that. 

A couple of things - I had a MA about a year ago. The process was long and extremely painful for me. I was bleeding heavily for about 24 hours, and kept bleeding for several days with pain. It was an extremely difficult process and I still felt completely drained at my follow up appointment.

I have a few reasons why I am not sure if a SA or MA is better.

1. I will not have an informed support system this time around. I dont want to get into too many details, but I have to lie and say that I had a miscarriage and not an abortion (I know some will think this is wrong. I am sorry but it is my situation. I will be leaving this situation once the abortion is done). This is the main reason why I think a MA might be better, unfortunately.

2. The pain. I understand SA is also painful, but from what I have read, it is much quicker. And I like the idea of having a medical team with me during the whole process. 

3. I am nervous about having to sneak to two separate appointments for an MA. 

I also have a few questions, if anyone is willing to share. 

1. How long do you bleed after the SA procedure? 

2. Can a doctor tell that I have had a surgical abortion if I go to the ER? I believe they cant tell if I have had an MA.

3. When I go to my appointment, will they do the SA on that day? 

Thanks in advance for the help. Its really difficult and scary doing this by myself and keeping it a secret. I just want to be as prepared and informed as possible. If anyone has been through a similar situation, I would greatly appreciate some advice d",abortion,7.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jap5vf/deciding_between_ma_or_sa_keeping_the_abortion_a/

2025-03-14,1741912716.0,Pregnant to my ex,"So I found out I was pregnant about a week after my ex broke up with me.  I use the term ex very loosely as we had only been together about 3 months.
I told him I was pregnant and was keeping the baby, I have a decent paying job and expected to have a good support network around. It was his choice if he wanted to be involved. He said he would support my decision and be there for me. 

Fast forward to now Im currently 16 weeks pregnant, I have a few friends that are supportive (but have their own lives)and baby dad who was doing what he could until the past couple weeks. My family have said Im being selfish (very old fashioned and think Im crazy doing it alone) and havent been supportive at all. I have basically cut them out at this point. 

I was heavily relying on my ex for both emotional support but also just to make me feel less lonely. Its not been an easy pregnancy so far and Im high risk, Ive had to have him come over a few times at the advice of midwives. I know he has his own life to lead and hes said himself he cant be there 24/7 but does want to be involved, then backed off about 2/3 weeks ago. I have reached out but was brushed off, again it was a me problem, but if Im not healthy then baby isnt safe. He has been there when the midwives have advised me to take it easy and knows how high risk I am. I have been signed off work too. How much is too much to expect ?  Im really struggling both physically and mentally with the pregnancy. I also want to build a friendship with him so we can coparent to the best of our ability. I want to be comfortable around him for the birth but also afterwards. I dont think Ill want a practical stranger around me when Im in labour or even in the weeks/months following the birth. 
The fact he is aware that hes the only person I really have right now but is stepping away is also making me think will he do this to the baby.  Can I really trust him to be the best dad. I just want to build a friendship now, maybe initially I thought we could work on us but not now. 

For reference were late 30s early 40s he already has older children (young adults) this is my first but had previous miscarriages. I am financially stable enough to do it alone but just struggling with everything and him having stepped back Im feeling completely isolated. As I said I do have friends I can rely on but they have their own lives (jobs/kids/families etc)

Is it unreasonable to expect baby dad to be involved with me throughout the pregnancy?  Am I expecting too much to build a friendship or even expect him to support me right now?  I dont feel comfortable having him at the appts now or even asking for support when I had a scare. Baby seems to be ok its me thats not doing great. 

We got into a huge fight when I told him that I didnt want him to come along to my next appt and that from now on I was going to do it alone. I would just inform him of updates if there was issues.  That if he couldnt offer the support I needed then we would have to reassess his coming along and also the birth and beyond. I would honestly rather be alone than have him around right now. He just said theres no reason for us to be friends but he does want to know and be there for appts. He isnt getting my view that its my body and if I feel like he will be a stranger then it will be me who decides when he can visit and when he can attend the appts or hospital after birth.

He was really pushing for either CVS or amino to further test but Im just scared about the risk. Ive been reading online that 2.9 isnt too abnormal and would rather not risk a miscarriage because no result would sway me from carrying to term anyway.

2025-03-13,1741893655.0,PL for religious reasons - why are your churchs teachings on reproductive rights the 100% absolute truth?,"One of the biggest arguments that I see PL make is that the Bible says abortion is wrong &amp; it goes against Christian values. Faith is not something I particularly relate to, but I do think it can be comforting and deeply personal. In fact, I think its admirable that people can so strongly believe in something that there is not necessarily physical evidence of - I am truly happy for all who find comfort in it.

My question is: why do you feel that your denominations abortion beliefs is correct and above all others?

There are 6 main branches of Christianity &amp; all of them have varying beliefs on abortion. Many protestant denominations are not only pro-choice, but actively advocate for womens reproductive rights. About 60% of Catholics are pro-choice, despite the churchs view on it. 40% of Evangelical Protestants support abortion in cases of rape &amp; 51% are in support for medical reasons. The Mormon, Episcopal, Methodist &amp; Southern Baptist churches support abortion in cases of rape &amp; medical reasons. 

Of course we also need to recognize that many Christian denominations are against it. I am not denying that. But even the churchs messaging is more empathetic &amp; does not include the typical you opened your legs, deal with it sentiment I see from a lot of PL Christians. For example, Pope Francis, who is against abortion, recognizes and advocates for more support for women seeking an abortion, such as grace, community and love. The Baptist Churchs stance preaches the need for access to contraception, community support &amp; financial help. They also acknowledge the complexity of abortion, and even stated this: We acknowledge that we often lack compassion, insight &amp; the necessary commitment to serve our Christian community. We affirm our commitment to &. maintain fellowship with those whose opinions differ from ours and extend the compassion of Christ to all. 

So PL Christians, why are you so adamant that your denominations teachings are correct? Why is whatever your pastor says the 100% absolute truth? Are those who take a more liberal stance not a true Christian and if so, why do you think you or your church has the right to decide what makes someone a real Christian?

How do you justify the contradictions in the Bible? There is not a soul on earth who can never sin, even the Bible says so. Why is abortion one of the worst sins, if all sins are equal? Why do you choose that abortion is wrong, but ignore the part about loving thy neighbor and not judging? Why are you a better Christian than your neighbor who attends a more liberal church down the street?

Thank you in advance - I see a lot of points on the PL side, but this is one that I just really dont comprehend so I appreciate all of the insight! ",Abortiondebate,40.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jak9lk/pl_for_religious_reasons_why_are_your_churchs/
2025-03-14,1741960952.0,My worst nightmare pregnant two post abortion US,"Well I got positive again.. my husband had reschedule his v surgery last month because the doctor went on vacation. I had decided I would track my period and we would avoid sex on ovulation or near it. But some how I guess I failed at that. I didnt want get on bc because of how it effects me mentally and I have already have mental health issues. So I thought I could track and that way Id prevent pregnancy and avoid getting on bc until his surgery that is now this month. I was told it was good way to avoid pregnancy if you didnt want to be on birth control. I figured I could handle that. We have literally had sex maybe three times at max in the last three months just trying to be cautious. I have two kids and my last baby I got car sick with. Two days ago I felt car sick and nauseous the next morning and I thought no way. Im still three days away from my period but I never get car sick expect when Im pregnant so that thought was eating me up so just to ease my mind I thought Id take a test. The way I felt sick immediately after getting the positive. Now my son birthday party is tomorrow and I have to make it through that whole time knowing Ive got so this all over again. My head wants to blame my husband because he was supposed to get V surgery over this past year and he put it off and of course when he finally gets it scheduled he had to reschedule. But two abortion back to back feels sick in my head because I know I could have prevented it and just got in bc in the mean time but besides just my mental health I didnt want my huband using me being on bc asa cop out. Not saying he has before but I thought it would make him push off my V more so if he felt I could get pregnant again ( he also doesnt want anymore kids) he would be motivated to get it done. Now I have to do the walk of shame to planned parenthood again I feel so embarrassed. The doctor there really encouraged me to get on bc and now look at me. I could break down crying. This sucks so bad and Im sorry to myself and my body. Im sorry to this baby that I cant keep. I physically couldnt carry a baby anyways anymore because after my last baby, I was told my uterus is so thin they couldnt tell the difference from a uterus in the sack. The baby was in and that I was lucky she had even made it to 36 weeks without my uterus bursting. It was due to devious c-section I have a lot scar tissue and it has sheered out my uterus.

2025-03-13,1741894005.0,im torn whether to get an abortion (CA),"Im 18 years old and in college. Im 10 1/2 weeks pregnant and have an appointment to get an abortion tomorrow (pills). But I have so much fear and anxiety around it. I told my mom and grandma I was pregnant at 3 weeks right after I found out. They were very supportive and my mom and stepdad would adopt the baby. They have two young children (under 4 years old), so my baby would be in their age range. Im also due the week before next school year starts so my pregnancy doesnt affect my schooling. When I first found out, I was so scared and nervous, but loved my baby immediately. At 6 weeks I had an ultrasound and saw the little blob and I felt so much excitement, even though I knew I would never get to raise it. HOWEVER, the issue is, my partner does not want this child. In the beginning he told me I had to get an abortion and at 6 weeks when we made the appointment to go to Planned Parenthood, I couldnt take the first pill. I sobbed and sobbed and begged him to not make me do this and he did not care. We had many fights before that appointment and after that appointment where he told me Im an awful selfish person if I keep the child and how its not okay to gamble on a childs happiness, as it will be adopted by its biological grandmother and still have contact with its birth mother (me). Sorry this is kind of all over the place, but at 4 weeks I told him I was keeping it and so he yelled at me about how much he hated me then left. I freaked out so I told him if he comes back Ill get an abortion. After the appointment where I couldnt take the pills, he left again. And for those two weeks where he was gone I have never been more depressed and lonely. I just missed him so much and wanted a partner in this. My first trimester was really really really rough (nausea, vomiting, MAJOR cramping, flu, sinus infection, ear infections, fatigue). I just began doubting if I could really survive these next 7 1/2 months and that maybe an abortion is whats best. He agreed, as he thinks its selfish to develop the embryo into a child. He said if i get an abortion hell be there for me 24/7 and whenever I need and do whatever I need but Im very unsure. Lately, I constantly cry about loving my baby and he just corrects me saying its an embryo still. But at the same time, if I get an abortion we would be together, wed live together over the summer, wed go on trips&but I know Ill regret it for the rest of my life. My biggest dream has been to have children and I know I wont be able to raise this child, but Im so attached already. I know Ill look at my future children and wonder what if. He says my regret will pass but I adamantly dont think it will& Im unsure what to do. I feel like Im choosing short term suffering over long term suffering. I cant talk to my family about this because they are pro life, so they would not be thrilled with my actions. I just dont know what to do. My gut is telling me to keep my baby but Idk if i can handle the depression and loneliness for these next few months. But I also dont know if i can handle that regret for the rest of my life.

I discovered I was pregnant on Feb 26th; I'd had what I thought was a light period on January 29th-30th-31st, but it turns out that must have been implantation bleeding. I thought I was only 10 days late for my period based on the timing of that bleed, but it turns out I was much further along. I hadn't had many symptoms except for very sore breasts, some tiredness and loss of appetite, all of which I tend to get before my cycle anyway, so I didn't clue in right away.

I'm in a solid, loving relationship, but we just aren't currently in a situation to add to our family. I have a young child from my previous relationship, and we live in a fairly modest apartment, and for many other reasons it just wouldn't be right to add to the family right now. 

I was a bit panicked when I found out I was pregnant, but my partner was incredibly supportive and understanding. I called my doctor the same day and was referred to our local hospital which has a program for women seeking termination.

I'm based in Canada and so it was a very calm and non-judgmental environment; I'm grateful to the doctor and nurse who walked me through my options and explained everything to me.

I was given an ultrasound and blood test the same day and they determined I was at exactly 10 weeks and 0 days, the cutoff for using medical termination in my province. They mentioned I could either schedule a surgical termination for the following week, or do the medical termination as long as I was willing to take the first pill that day. I decided on the medical because I wanted to end the pregnancy as soon as possible - my last pregnancy and birth process were extremely traumatic, and being pregnant again was giving me nightmares and flashbacks, so I couldn't handle the thought of waiting any longer.

Timeline:

6:00 pm Wednesday: took the mifepristone dose as directed. Had some very mild cramping starting about two hours later, which continued the following day.

1:00 pm Thursday: developed a headache, had some additional cramping and mildly upset stomach through the rest of the afternoon.

6:00 pm: took 10 mg ketorolac with a small amount of food.

6:45 pm: took 4 Misoprostol tablets in the cheek for 30 minutes as directed, washed down with water afterwards.

9:00 pm: started having some mild cramping which came in waves, slight chills. Very mild nausea which didn't last. Watched TV with partner and just tried to relax.

10:00 pm: started having some light spotting, cramps continuing. Cramps felt like my worst period day, nothing too major. Chills and started to have diarrhea.

10:45 pm: listened to an audiobook and went to sleep.

11:30 pm: woke up to a strange sensation, felt almost like my hands weren't attached to my body. Felt something shift in my lower abdomen, then a rush of fluid. Fortunately I was wearing heavy duty period undies in addition to a pad already and had no leakage. Went to the bathroom expecting pure blood but discovered it was pink tinted fluid which I assume was water breaking. Pad completely saturated. Pain very minimal.

As soon as I sat down on the toilet I felt something drop out. Had the sensation of needing to push, did so and a much larger clump came rushing out, along with quite a bit of blood. Peeked into the toilet and could see a ring shaped clot, and noticed a light pink thing partially submerged in the blood. It was not pleasant to see and I could tell it was part of a leg/lower torso of the embryo, extremely small but unmistakable.

Had a bit of a cry. Said I was sorry. Remembered what some of the other women have said on here about their babies becoming part of the water. I did not want to be pregnant, but I couldn't help but have feelings about it. I stayed for a while before saying goodbye and flushing.

1:30 am: woke up again, mild cramping and passed some more clots. Took a second ketorolac. Came back to bed and fell asleep easily.

6:00 am: woke up at my normal time, immediately felt different than I'd been feeling for the last few weeks. Breasts still a little sore but pain noticeably reduced from how they had been feeling prior. Did not have the morning upset stomach, and was able to enjoy a coffee (I'd been having aversion to it for about three weeks). Actually had energy as opposed to feeling extremely fatigued. Had moderate amount of blood on the pad and a few tiny clots when going to the bathroom, similar to a day 2 period.

10:30 am (present): cramps have almost completely subsided, have not needed more ketorolac. Ate some breakfast. Still have what is similar to a day 2 period. Energy is much higher than it normally is at this time of the morning.

I will still need to monitor for unusual bleeding, signs of infection, or increasing pain, and will need a follow up to confirm everything has passed, but ultimately the process was not what I expected. I originally worried that 4 Misoprostol wouldn't be sufficient, given that I was 10 weeks along and I've seen stories on here of women needing double the dose. I was worried it wasn't working initially as it took quite some time for the bleeding to start.

For anyone facing this situation right now: just know that you aren't alone. You are doing what is best for your body, and if you aren't ready to give up everything for a baby it means you're doing the right thing for your baby too. Sending healing thoughts and wishes to all of you who are reading this and feeling scared - you can do this if you need to.",abortion,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jb5i23/positive_ma_experience_10w_0d/
2025-03-13,1741908477.0,PH to BKK Experience (Klongtun Hospital),"Hello everyone! I just wanted to share my experience getting an MVA (Manual Vacuum Aspiration) from Klongtun Hospital in Thailand. 


So on February 2024, I found out I was around 4-5 weeks pregnant. At that time I was thinking about ordering pills from WOW and doing the Pill Method instead, but since reading reviews that shipping could take quite a while, my boyfriend and I decided to go to Thailand instead. 


Before the trip and procedure, I talked to Jenny from Klongtun on Line. She gave me the options they had and the price list for all the procedure and the room rates, she also explained what to expect before the procedure (all the lab test and etc). So eventually I booked a slot for March 14 and she gave me an appoinment card. 


Fast forward to March 14, my boyfriend and I took an early morning flight from Manila to Bangkok after everything we checked in our hotel first and had late lunch, eventually we arrived at Klongtun Hospital at around 3:50 PM. 


This was how the process went for me:
- I showed them my appointment card then they quickly asked for my passport and 500thb (cash) for the ultrasound. 

- After the ultrasound, I found out I was already 8 weeks pregnant. 

- I had a consultation and the doctor recommended I do the MVA method, since the whole procedure would only take 5 minutes and I just had to rest for 2-3 hours after. She quoted me 11,000thb for everything (all the tests, MVA procedure, and room fee). She also disclosed that the doctor who will be doing my procedure is male. Afterwards, I paid the 11k using my debit card. 

- After paying, I waited for a bit to do the physical exam (they measured my height, weight, blood pressure, and they cleaned my V and did a pap smear, tbh the pap smear was kind of painful, more painful than the ones I've had in Manila). 

- After the physical exam, they asked my boyfriend to wait in another building then they accompanied me to leave my stuff on the 2nd floor and then accompanied me to the 3rd floor to change to a hospital gown and remove my undies. 

- After changing to a hospital gown, they asked me to lie down first. At this point, there was another girl sleeping in the same room so I assumed I would also be resting there too. 

- After a few minutes they asked me to go to the operating room. It was quite hectic because as soon as I got there they asked me to lie down with my legs up, the nurse to my left stuck a needle on my left hand to sedate me to sleep, while the nurse to my right was measuring my blood pressure, then the nurse in front of me was cleaning my V for the procedure. I saw the male doctor walk in as well, all the nurses were female BTW. At this point, I was feeling very anxious and I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to sleep but yes I did fall asleep immediately after they sedated me. 

- After the procedure, I woke up in a different room with lots of beds but I was the only one there, and at this point the nurse in charge wouldn't let me go up to use the bathroom she just told me to rest and sleep. After a while, she did allow me to use the toilet and she said it was ok for me to use a bidet. At this time she showed me my new ultrasound and the baby was no longer there. She told me the don'ts after the procedure such as: don't drink or eat food that's too hot, don't use a hot compress but warm compress is ok, etc). She also told me that I was asleep for about an hour and a half. She also gave the medicine (ibuprofen, antibiotics, iron pills) and instructions post abortion. After that, I just changed to my clothes and used the sanitary pad they provided. 

- After I was done, I just chatted with some of the nurses they told me it was ok to eat spicy food and raw food. Just not to consume alcohol. 


*Some tips I think that would help:
- go on a weekday as the hospital is not crowded at all. 
- don't be shy to ask the hospital and doctors all your questions before and after the procedure. Based on my experience, they were very patient and answered everything for me. 
- the first few hours were painful for me (felt like really bad dysmenorrhea), but what really helped eased my cramps was doing a warm compress, emphasis on warm. I brought my own hot/cold pack and used it in the hotel. 
- be prepared for the Bangkok traffic, I thought Manila traffic was already crazy but Bangkok is on another level. Although in my opinion, the price of Grab here is better than in Manila. 
- I highly suggest doing this with someone you can trust, as the whole process is very overwhelming and honestly you will need help and assistance esp during the first few hours after the procedure.


I just wanted to share my experience for those who feel anxious about their situation now. For me, the whole experience was very comfortable and I'm glad I got the procedure and healthcare I needed without any prejudice. If you have any questions about the price of the procedure, or if you just have any questions I highly suggest messaging them directly. 

Will try to update again about the post abortion experience. So far it's been about 12 hours since and I don't feel any pain at all.

2025-03-13,1741909577.0,Struggling with grief and sadness after MA,"This is just a vent, I'm not looking for any advice. 

I am 21, from the United States, and I thought I was doing what was right for me. I still believe that to be the case (I'm active duty military, still in school, and not mentally ready for a baby), but as the days go by I keep thinking about how things might have been. I still have the pregnancy tests from when I found out and I can't bring myself to get rid of them. 

I found out on March 1st, had my MA on the 7th. It all happened so fast that I didn't allow myself to feel any of the emotions until now. From the moment I found out, I had a gut feeling that it would have been a girl. After the initial shock, I accepted the fact that I was pregnant and grew attached to the life I was growing, even though I was only five weeks. I feel like I shouldn't be having these emotions, because it wasn't actually a baby, but I do. I don't have much of a support group (my fiance seems annoyed whenever I try to talk about it, my mother - though supportive - is very emotional and cries if I cry) so I'm mostly dealing with this alone. Thanks for allowing me to vent. ",abortion,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jaqe6e/struggling_with_grief_and_sadness_after_ma/
2025-03-13,1741901137.0,boyfriend left 3 months after abortion,"I'm really just looking for emotional support, I've been going to therapy, talking to friends, but wanted to come into this space to see if others have had similar situations.

Backstory: My boyfriend was 13 years younger than me, I have 2 kids from a previous marriage, this was really the first time I was in love with someone again after my divorce which was a couple years out at this point. We got pregnant after seeing each other for about 3 months. At the time, it felt like an relatively easy answer. Never totally easy, especially as a mom, I know what it's like to go through pregnancy and give birth and love my babies, but I went ahead and opted for a MA right away. It ended up being fairly traumatic though, because it didn't work. I had to go in and get an ultrasound to confirm, and then went on to get a D&amp;C as soon as I could after that. So yeah, totally sucked, definitely left a mark on me more so than I would have expected. 

Fast-forward a few months later: I was on birth control pills now, and end up getting pregnant AGAIN anyways. This time, I'm feeling the effects of the previous experience, my boyfriend and I are much more stable and in love as a couple. I'm not really too spiritual but the chances of all this happening really floored me. I felt so much more protective of this pregnancy, big mama bear energy. Like I wanted to meet this person. I even started looking into open adoptions and contemplated what it would be like to raise a baby on my own, which honestly I felt pretty confident about. My boyfriend was freaked out, and basically gave me an ultimatum saying that if I went and kept the pregnancy he doesn't know if he could stay with me romantically at that point. I felt SO in love with this person that as soon as he said that, that was it, I felt so committed to our relationship and was like, I can't blame him for feeling this way, I get he was young and freaking out, but I choose him and our relationship. Had a harder time getting over this abortion, got depressed, the holidays were really rough for me. I was having a ton of depression and anxiety during this time. Then in January, about 3 months after the abortion, he broke up with me. 

It's been a couple months later, and I'm just SO angry and hurt. I'm such a loyal partner and I'm just so confused. I also hate the fact that this is causing me pain and I think about this all the time and I'm sure he hasn't even realized or given it a second thought. I usually have a lot of compassion for people, like if he needed to leave the relationship, I get it, but the timing still feels so awful, it still feels like I made a huge sacrifice for nothing. I feel like I want some kind of justice, but I know the healthy thing is to forgive him and move on.

2025-03-14,1741939059.0,My experience with surgical abortion,"Hello, I wanted to share my experience with a surgical abortion as I know reading other peoples experience helped ease my mind when I was going through it. It's quite detailed, feel free to skip straight to the abortion para, or the end if you just want the key takeaways. (I'm not going to be talking about the morality or debating, if you are pro-life this post isn't for you.)

PRE-ABORTION: I'm 23, I found out I was pregnant at 4 weeks, this was unplanned, I went to a doctor to discuss my options and was told if i wanted to terminate the pregnancy I had to be 5/6 weeks before I could have the pill. To schedule my abortion I called a woman's clinic and was recommended the surgical abortion from them which I was happier with having spoken to 2 people who had the medical one who both said they would recommend I do surgical instead. (I have a low pain tolerance and health anxiety so this made the most sense for me). For the next 2 weeks I had morning sickness and an intense fatigue accompanied with a lack of appetite and just genuinely feeling nauseous and exhausted all the time. 

ABORTION: The day of my abortion I was just over 5 weeks pregnant, when I got to the clinic i was initially in a waiting room, my boyfriend was with me, as I was going under anesthesia and so you have to have someone to drive you home and stay with you for the next 4 hours minimum. I was called in for the first part of it and was given the option to bring him with me up until the actual procedure, which i took. In this part I had an ultrasound where I saw the fetus (I wasn't asked if this is something I wanted to see), then I signed consent forms saying i wouldn't drive, understood the risks etc... 

Then I went into the next room where i spoke to the doctor who was going to be carrying out the abortion. There was a sign on the wall saying ""sometimes hard decisions are the right ones,"" which I liked. She asked me about contraception in the future and when i said condoms she accepted it without question and didn't try to pressure me into hormonal birth control which I've experienced with male doctors in the past. (We didnt use a condom the time I accidentally conceived). She then explained the procedure and that they would essentially be sucking it out of my uterus.  Next i spoke to the anesthesiologist who answered any of my questions regarding that. 

For the procedure I was given a lightweight pink robe instead of a hospital gown, a nurse took me through to the operating room. There was 3 people in total: nurse, doctor and anesthesiologist. I was freaking out at this point and they were compassionate with me and told me when the needle was going in, I began to get groggy and then they put a mask on my face and that was the last thing I remembered.

I woke up in a separate room, made private by a curtain, very groggy and confused, I was laying on a bed with a hot water bottle on my stomach. A nurse came in, asked me how i was feeling and if i wanted painkillers, to which i said yes. The pain wasn't that bad it was like period cramping I more so felt strange. They then offered me coffee/tea/juice and brought in a pack of biscuits and brought my boyfriend in to sit with me as the anesthesia started to wear off. I was there about 30/40 minutes from waking up before we were discharged. For the rest of the day I slept/ watched tv on the couch and took it really slow, as i was very tired. I have only had very minimal bleeding and light cramping since the procedure. The nausea and morning sickness went away instantly. I was given a course of antibiotics for 6 days to prevent infection as that is one of the most common side effects so i have taken one of them every day but for the most part I was fine after with very minimal pain (i used a hot water bottle, didn't need painkillers).

  
Overall I would say it went as well as it could and the procedure itself is nothing to be afraid of as you are in good hands and they do these things every single day multiple times a day, and I have a low pain tolerance and I really had very little (which was one of my main concerns). 

The only other thing to note was price, it was expensive, $700 Aud with Medicare but as i didn't have it i was $1200 out of pocket. ",abortion,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jayr3g/my_experience_with_surgical_abortion/
2025-03-14,1741951971.0,my complications wont end and I just want my abortion to be over,"Found out I was pregnant 7/2 and took mife on the 10th and miso on the 12th.

I was very early, about 4-5 weeks pregnant so I assume thats why I had a very light bleeding that only lasted a few days. I passed small clots and slimy tissue but after a few days that was it. 

Went for a blood test the next day and my hCG levels had sank and everything was fine and she asked me to take a pregnancy test 4 weeks after the abortion. Monday was the 4th week and it was a weak positive line. I told her and I came in for an ultrasound checkup and she couldnt really see anything but wanted me to do a blood test to make sure and they found that my hCG levels had actually RISEN.

2025-03-14,1741960952.0,My worst nightmare pregnant two post abortion US,"Well I got positive again.. my husband had reschedule his v surgery last month because the doctor went on vacation. I had decided I would track my period and we would avoid sex on ovulation or near it. But some how I guess I failed at that. I didnt want get on bc because of how it effects me mentally and I have already have mental health issues. So I thought I could track and that way Id prevent pregnancy and avoid getting on bc until his surgery that is now this month. I was told it was good way to avoid pregnancy if you didnt want to be on birth control. I figured I could handle that. We have literally had sex maybe three times at max in the last three months just trying to be cautious. I have two kids and my last baby I got car sick with. Two days ago I felt car sick and nauseous the next morning and I thought no way. Im still three days away from my period but I never get car sick expect when Im pregnant so that thought was eating me up so just to ease my mind I thought Id take a test. The way I felt sick immediately after getting the positive. Now my son birthday party is tomorrow and I have to make it through that whole time knowing Ive got so this all over again. My head wants to blame my husband because he was supposed to get V surgery over this past year and he put it off and of course when he finally gets it scheduled he had to reschedule. But two abortion back to back feels sick in my head because I know I could have prevented it and just got in bc in the mean time but besides just my mental health I didnt want my huband using me being on bc asa cop out. Not saying he has before but I thought it would make him push off my V more so if he felt I could get pregnant again ( he also doesnt want anymore kids) he would be motivated to get it done. Now I have to do the walk of shame to planned parenthood again I feel so embarrassed. The doctor there really encouraged me to get on bc and now look at me. I could break down crying. This sucks so bad and Im sorry to myself and my body. Im sorry to this baby that I cant keep. I physically couldnt carry a baby anyways anymore because after my last baby, I was told my uterus is so thin they couldnt tell the difference from a uterus in the sack. The baby was in and that I was lucky she had even made it to 36 weeks without my uterus bursting. It was due to devious c-section I have a lot scar tissue and it has sheered out my uterus. So I dont really have a choice but at the same time I had a choice to get in bc but my stupidity and choices have led me back to this. Im so sorry.

(advice please),"Ill start this by saying I know Ill get the judgement so harshly, but do know that everyone isnt just going into the activity everyday with the same mood and feeling (aka. sex). At this point in time, Ive had two abortions. The first time was simply my first time ever getting pregnant and i wasnt even sure if I was able to. Plus the events around the first time made the choice easier. The second time, it was more so realizing this full situation Im in and Id possibly be in if I had the child. I was still stressing and this time the choice was a little bit more difficult than before because I felt that maybe it wouldnt be that bad, but then again this shouldnt have happened twice. I had more feelings the second time as well. I went outside and just let loose. The way I was reacting had me questioning myself, but I was told those feeling were normal when I went the first time. Difference was I didnt feel anything the first time. Now Im pregnant again, but I have different feelings. I know I dont want my baby in a bad environment, especially school. I dont even want to be here when I have children. But Im not sure if I can do this a third time&.

If I were to do it, I know I would not have this problem again until Im ready.

2025-03-13,1741894005.0,im torn whether to get an abortion (CA),"Im 18 years old and in college. Im 10 1/2 weeks pregnant and have an appointment to get an abortion tomorrow (pills). But I have so much fear and anxiety around it. I told my mom and grandma I was pregnant at 3 weeks right after I found out. They were very supportive and my mom and stepdad would adopt the baby. They have two young children (under 4 years old), so my baby would be in their age range. Im also due the week before next school year starts so my pregnancy doesnt affect my schooling. When I first found out, I was so scared and nervous, but loved my baby immediately. At 6 weeks I had an ultrasound and saw the little blob and I felt so much excitement, even though I knew I would never get to raise it. HOWEVER, the issue is, my partner does not want this child. In the beginning he told me I had to get an abortion and at 6 weeks when we made the appointment to go to Planned Parenthood, I couldnt take the first pill. I sobbed and sobbed and begged him to not make me do this and he did not care. We had many fights before that appointment and after that appointment where he told me Im an awful selfish person if I keep the child and how its not okay to gamble on a childs happiness, as it will be adopted by its biological grandmother and still have contact with its birth mother (me). Sorry this is kind of all over the place, but at 4 weeks I told him I was keeping it and so he yelled at me about how much he hated me then left. I freaked out so I told him if he comes back Ill get an abortion. After the appointment where I couldnt take the pills, he left again. And for those two weeks where he was gone I have never been more depressed and lonely. I just missed him so much and wanted a partner in this. My first trimester was really really really rough (nausea, vomiting, MAJOR cramping, flu, sinus infection, ear infections, fatigue). I just began doubting if I could really survive these next 7 1/2 months and that maybe an abortion is whats best. He agreed, as he thinks its selfish to develop the embryo into a child. He said if i get an abortion hell be there for me 24/7 and whenever I need and do whatever I need but Im very unsure. Lately, I constantly cry about loving my baby and he just corrects me saying its an embryo still. But at the same time, if I get an abortion we would be together, wed live together over the summer, wed go on trips&but I know Ill regret it for the rest of my life. My biggest dream has been to have children and I know I wont be able to raise this child, but Im so attached already. I know Ill look at my future children and wonder what if. He says my regret will pass but I adamantly dont think it will& Im unsure what to do. I feel like Im choosing short term suffering over long term suffering. I cant talk to my family about this because they are pro life, so they would not be thrilled with my actions. I just dont know what to do. My gut is telling me to keep my baby but Idk if i can handle the depression and loneliness for these next few months. But I also dont know if i can handle that regret for the rest of my life.

2025-03-14,1741922753.0,Struggling with my decision.,"

Im struggling with my decision to have an abortion. Im currently 6 weeks, and the next available appointment isnt until April 2nd (by then Ill be 9 weeks). The guilt is eating me alive, I have had a medical abortion 2 years ago and it was traumatizing! The pain I felt was extreme, and Ive vowed that I would do that again but here I am&

Ive been trying to justify my decision with the fact that Ive been experiencing severe hg and also suffer with HS (which is causing me immense pain due to the hormonal change), and as well as the thoughts that once it is gone Ill be okay again.. but my biggest excuse is that Im terrified to lose my freedom. 

Im 25 and I am in my second year of university while working full time..my spouse has landed a new job also and were excited to have a reliable income together. We are the type of people who are always doing something together, going to the movies randomly, attending concerts, clubbing, and just making spontaneous decisions..so when I found out I was pregnant, I felt like my world was coming to an end. Mind you, I do want children (we both do), but at this point in my life I feel like this is not the time :( I still want to travel the world while were young, because I know when we have children we will lose that freedom. Its killing me because Im terrified to experience that pain again, but also the guilt that we both want children. 

We have been talking about how we feel like were getting old meanwhile everyone around us has families (joking our kids wont have friends because everyone will be older). I feel so angry, and depressed that I cant properly decide on keeping the baby and settling to loose our freedom, or to abort and seek the life we wanted? Every day my decision changes like okay Ill keep it and accept the loss then the next Ill mourn the loss of my freedom and want the abortion. Im angry at my spouse because he doesnt understand the mental turmoil Im going through and is just all whatever you choose, its fine with me so Im left making this huge decision for our lives. The pain is unbearable, Ive been feeling so depressed and everyday I consider taking my own life instead, and to wait longer until April 2nd,  with these thoughts are haunting me, Im scared.

17 days ago I had a suction abortion, I was 6 weeks so early to handle what I had to do. 

Im 31 year old and I have a son who is 10 years old. 

I have a stable and supportive relationship with my boyfriend of almost 2 years and we live together in my houseboat. 

I had the abortion because my boyfriend wasnt ready yet (he is 23) and also the thought of having a baby on board is possible but not at all ideal. 
I did what I knew was best even tho I got warm fuzzy feelings towards the idea of being pregnant and having a love baby together. 

Since Im not on birthcontrol (I tried several times but I have a lot of side effects wich I dont want to have) I asked if he would want a vesectomy (excuse my English as it isnt my language) but he doesnt want that so we agreed on condoms. 

I made him clear that I want him to take the lead and the responsibility in this since he is the one that isnt ready to have kids, pointed out where I put the new package of condoms etc (within reach) 

Today (17 days after the abortion) we had sex for the first time, you probably hear it coming already; as he started cuddling and slides it in unprotected.. even tho I did warn him several times AND told him I dont want to have had this abortion for nothing as we have the risk of getting pregnant directly. 

I did push him out eventually and he is a very supportive and good lovely guy but this action of him gave me a lot of emotions so I wanted to talk about it in this group. 
Afterwards I did confront him as well about if he did think when he just pushed it in and he said he did but couldnt resist. 

Anyway, I had to get it off my chest, I really do like the idea of having one, but here I am trying to defend his decision after all i went through with the abortion 17 days ago wich I didnt took lightly& ",abortion,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jb6o8s/sharing_thoughts/

2025-03-14,1741941564.0,Abortion Is Okay Because Its Their Choice,"At the end of the day, abortion is a personal decision, and no one should be forced to stay pregnant against their will. Pregnancy is a major medical event that affects a persons body, health, future, and life in ways that only they can fully understand. No one else has to experience the physical pain, the risks, the emotional toll, or the lifelong consequences of giving birthso why should anyone else get to decide?

Some argue that a fetus has a right to life, but even if we grant that, no one has the right to use another persons body without consent. We dont force people to donate organs, even if it would save a life. If bodily autonomy applies to everyone else, why should it suddenly stop applying to pregnant people?

People get abortions for all kinds of reasonsfinancial instability, medical risks, being too young, not wanting to be a parent, or simply not wanting to be pregnant. And they shouldnt have to justify it. No one is obligated to give up their body for someone else, and pregnancy should be no exception.

If someone believes abortion is wrong, they dont have to get one. But forcing others to stay pregnant against their will is not about valuing lifeits about controlling peoples bodies.",Abortiondebate,221.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jazbb9/abortion_is_okay_because_its_their_choice/

2025-03-14,1741912716.0,Pregnant to my ex,"So I found out I was pregnant about a week after my ex broke up with me.  I use the term ex very loosely as we had only been together about 3 months.
I told him I was pregnant and was keeping the baby, I have a decent paying job and expected to have a good support network around. It was his choice if he wanted to be involved. He said he would support my decision and be there for me. 

Fast forward to now Im currently 16 weeks pregnant, I have a few friends that are supportive (but have their own lives)and baby dad who was doing what he could until the past couple weeks. My family have said Im being selfish (very old fashioned and think Im crazy doing it alone) and havent been supportive at all. I have basically cut them out at this point. 

I was heavily relying on my ex for both emotional support but also just to make me feel less lonely. Its not been an easy pregnancy so far and Im high risk, Ive had to have him come over a few times at the advice of midwives. I know he has his own life to lead and hes said himself he cant be there 24/7 but does want to be involved, then backed off about 2/3 weeks ago. I have reached out but was brushed off, again it was a me problem, but if Im not healthy then baby isnt safe. He has been there when the midwives have advised me to take it easy and knows how high risk I am. I have been signed off work too. How much is too much to expect ?  Im really struggling both physically and mentally with the pregnancy. I also want to build a friendship with him so we can coparent to the best of our ability. I want to be comfortable around him for the birth but also afterwards. I dont think Ill want a practical stranger around me when Im in labour or even in the weeks/months following the birth. 
The fact he is aware that hes the only person I really have right now but is stepping away is also making me think will he do this to the baby.  Can I really trust him to be the best dad. I just want to build a friendship now, maybe initially I thought we could work on us but not now. 

For reference were late 30s early 40s he already has older children (young adults) this is my first but had previous miscarriages. I am financially stable enough to do it alone but just struggling with everything and him having stepped back Im feeling completely isolated. As I said I do have friends I can rely on but they have their own lives (jobs/kids/families etc)

Is it unreasonable to expect baby dad to be involved with me throughout the pregnancy?  Am I expecting too much to build a friendship or even expect him to support me right now?  I dont feel comfortable having him at the appts now or even asking for support when I had a scare. Baby seems to be ok its me thats not doing great. 

We got into a huge fight when I told him that I didnt want him to come along to my next appt and that from now on I was going to do it alone. I would just inform him of updates if there was issues.  That if he couldnt offer the support I needed then we would have to reassess his coming along and also the birth and beyond. I would honestly rather be alone than have him around right now. He just said theres no reason for us to be friends but he does want to know and be there for appts. He isnt getting my view that its my body and if I feel like he will be a stranger then it will be me who decides when he can visit and when he can attend the appts or hospital after birth. 

Maybe I was being too needy, maybe I was expecting too much.  But when I discovered I was pregnant I wasnt expecting to have this emotional turmoil, or to have such a high risk pregnancy. But I also feel he should have been clearer from the start about his boundaries. ",pregnant,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jargtm/pregnant_to_my_ex/

I'm literally crying my eyes out as I type this. I'm 39+6 today, I will be 40 weeks tomorrow. I have tried *everything* I can do get this baby out since 39 weeks. Now before I get lectured about being patient and letting the baby &amp; my body do what it needs to do, I want to say that unless you're in my situation, I don't want to hear that. 

I wanted to be induced at 40 weeks from the beginning as this as been a very difficult pregnancy and I *have* to work up until I give birth and I work as a housekeeper at a hospital, so I have a physically demanding job. I have accomodations and now I only clean one corridor during my shift but at this point, I'm so exhausted. Everything hurts. I have no stamina or energy anymore.

But at my last appointment with my OB, she didn't want to schedule an induction and wanted to discuss it later (this was at 37 weeks) I missed my 38 week appointment due to oversleeping and I missed my 39 week appointment which was yesterday due to the fact that I was having contractions and believed I was going into labor so I spent the time that should've been my appointment, at the hospital being evaluated for the contractions. The contractions stopped. So, it was false labor I guess. 

My next appointment is on the 19th but my doctor will be out of office and I'm meeting with her nurse instead. 

But I can't take this anymore. I just want relief. I'm sick of working while heavily pregnant. I just want to have my baby and start my leave. 

I'm going to try the miles circuit again tonight but if that doesn't work, I feel like my last resort is to go to L&amp;D and beg for them to induce me tomorrow at 40 weeks. I don't care about pitocin, emergency C-Sections, or anything else. I am literally losing my mind, I'm at my wit's end and I can't stop crying, I can't take this anymore

2025-03-13,1741898316.0,Pregnant and Conflicted  Need Advice,"I found out about a week ago that Im pregnant (currently 4 weeks and 4 days). My boyfriend (22) and I (25) always said that if an ""oops"" happened, abortion would be the planbut we also acknowledged that you never truly know how youll feel until you're in that situation. And now, here we are.

I finish my nursing degree in December, have a steady job managing social media (which isnt hard to do and pays well), and were planning to move to Florida next summer. My boyfriend still has at least 3-4 years left of school (he's studying to be a chiropractor or physical therapist), and while he wants to be a dad one day, he admits now is not ideal. That said, he has made it clear that its ultimately my choice, since its my body.

I am pro-choice, but the thought of going through an abortion puts me in such a dark place mentally that I genuinely dont think I could survive it. Its not that I feel ""ready"" to be a mombecause who ever really is?but I just cant see myself going through the process of an abortion. His mom initially said its my decision, but she supports abortion and even called me to basically push for it. My boyfriend, while not pressuring me, also knows keeping the baby isnt what he would have chosen.

I know having a baby right now would make things a lot harder, especially with our move coming up. But I also know I *can* do it. My job is remote, and Ill still be able to work once we move. Plus, Ive always dreamed of being a momliterally forever. I want to be a pediatric or NiCU nurse, and once we move, I plan to find a job in either PEDS or NICU nursing while continuing to work remotely. Having a baby while finishing school wasnt part of the plan, but its not impossible.

Whats weighing on me is knowing that this wouldnt be his choice, and that his mom has already made it clear where she stands. He also told me that if we keep the baby, he probably wouldnt be able to work while studying, and he wants to be able to give the baby everything. I dont want to ruin his future, but I also feel like Id be ruining myself if I went through with an abortion.

Our relationship is so full of love, and the idea of ending this pregnancy when we are happy together *hurts*. It haunts me. I just dont know what to do.

I see a ton of posts about inductions being pushed for suspected large babies but not small, so I wanted to initiate the conversation and see if anyone has experience with this. I have had a totally normal healthy pregnancy so far, 31 years old pregnant with my first baby (a baby boy!) and underwent a routine 36 week US at my office (in retrospect I wish I declined this but you live and you learn) which showed that my baby's estimated fetal weight is 9th percentile, which is technically ""fetal growth restriction"". Of note he measured 24th percentile at prior ultrasound at 28 weeks. I have a repeat growth scan at 38 weeks 3 days and if he is still 9th percentile my OB is recommended induction between 38 to 39 weeks. I have had BPPs and dopplers to check blood flow which have all been totally normal, and I have a gut feeling that this is all seriously overkill. Also of note I was a small baby (6lb4oz at birth) and my husband and I are not big people (115lb pre pregnancy, husband is 150lb), and I have only gained 20-25 lbs during pregnancy. I am praying that he is 10th percentile or above at the growth scan so this is all a moot point, but if he does remain 9th percentile I am really inclined to decline induction if everything else remains stable as to not open the can of worms for cascade of intervention, but of course my first priority is baby's safety and would never want to put him at risk in doing so. Does anyone have any words or wisdom or experience this?!

Im at 32 weeks, and friends have been giving gifts and signing them Aunt. For example, they sign their name as Aunt Jane in cards to me, or with a note to baby on the inside of a book. 

No one has asked me how I feel about it, and tbh it feels weird!! I love these people, but many of them live far away, and I would call them FRIENDS, not family. Im so excited for them to meet this baby and vice versa, but I dont think they will be the babys family. 

Obviously family isnt just blood or marriage. But not every friend is family. Some friends are just friends, even if they are very good friends!

I think it bugs me because while I know they are really writing this because they feel close to me, my baby is a separate person. I want this baby to be able to have clear boundaries and expectations with adults. I want them to understand what it means to have familywhat you should be able to expect from family, and what they should be able to expect from you. Friends and family might blur together sometimes, but if someone says theyre your family, kids should be able to form ideas of what that means. And if they decide one of my friends feels like an aunt to them, or we become so interdependent with someone that they become family, then great! But thats not where we are with these folks. 

I know were some time away from these things actually becoming an issue, and that likely it will never be an issue. But some of these folks I see once every 1-3 years. I dont want to show up at their house for a visit one day and have to explain to them then that no, Im not going to tell my child to call them aunt, and they shouldnt ask for that, either. 

My husband assures me this is very far from a big deal, and I know hes right, but it just feels very intrusive. Its like the emotional equivalent of someone touching your belly without asking. I know people already love this baby, and I love that, but they are their own little person, not just an extension of me. 

I know others will likely have their own opinions here. Please feel free to share, but Id also just ask up front that you dont feel the need to say there is a right vs wrong here or try to put down the feeling that Im having.

For a good few weeks I have been feeling bumps on my cervix, that's the best I can describe it, it's not a real twinge of pain but a noticeable little jab feeling really low down in the cervix area. I am very occasionally having what I believe is round ligament pain more towards the front, on either side, and that is indeed painful. I read that baby kicks will feel like bubbles or flutters, might I be feeling something more like pain because the cervix area is more sensitive? I had ultrasounds at 11 and 12 weeks and the techs commented that he was particularly active.

  
All that said, I am having some pelvic girdle pain, initially across my lower back and more recently up inside my thighs, the hip adductor. So maybe that's what's causing the little jabs as it's the same area.

I was a 103, but honestly I think that could be explained by the fact that fasting can make your glucose go up if you have PCOS (they had me fast for 12 hours this time whereas last time I only fasted for 8 hours), AND the girl taking my blood was CLEARLY new. She stabbed my arm like 6 times before moving over to the other arm, again stabbed me like 6 times, and finally had to go get someone else to do it. I REALLY dont do well with blood, and stress can cause your blood sugar to spike. 

My one hour came back and it was exactly 180, which is the cutoff. Then I passed my 2 hour and 3 hour with flying colors! Like, I was a 140 for my two hour (cutoff is 155), and I was a 118 for my three hour (cutoff is 140). 

My doctor calls me today and tells me that I have gestational diabetes. Uhm, WHAT??!!! What do you mean???? I passed my two hour and my three hour test???? And I was right at the cutoff for my one hour test. So they basically just qualified me because my fasting levels are off ? Even though that can be explained by my PCOS and the stress of being stabbed multiple times. And because my one hour test is EXACTLY on the 180 mark? 

I just feel like my doctors dont know what theyre talking about which makes me so nervous. And I was trying to talk to the nurse and she just kept saying your results were abnormal so you qualify and I was like but then why did I even do the two and three hour testing?? If you were going to qualify me from the one hour why didnt you do that the first time I failed my one hour test at 26 weeks?? They told me I had to go in to see how I did at 2 hours and 3 hours and that would determine whether I had it or not. And I passed both of those well within the normal range! 

I just really dont want to prick my finger four times a day if it doesnt seem necessary. I am really really really not good with blood. I of course will do whatever I need to do to protect my baby, but I just wish someone could explain to me how these numbers mean that I have gestational diabetes. I thought you could fail your one hour and still be fine, but apparently being exactly on the cutoff for one hour and being high for a fasting level is enough to qualify you?

2025-03-13,1741899931.0,Severe food anxiety?? ED symptoms coming back with pregnancy,"I'm almost through my second trimester and have thankfully had a healthy pregnancy so far. I've tried to be relatively vigilant about the things I'm eating and avoid highly processed food or fast foods, and balance my diet in general so I'm not getting too much of one thing. Of course, sometimes it doesn't always work out, but I like to think I'm doing alright. The issue is, it seems like my desire to eat healthy has verged into overreactive anxiety. It's gotten really bad, where I'm starting to actually count grams of each ingredient and overthink even healthy things, like peanut butter or yogurt or too much fruit. A few years ago I battled anorexia, and it occurred to me today that a lot of the thoughts I've had the past couple weeks seem almost identical to the ones I struggled with back thenthe only difference is that I'm not starving myself. However, if I wasn't pregnant, I probably would. It doesn't help that my mom keeps sending me posts all the time about potential dangers, like chemicals in foods or mattresses or toys, etc. She's trying to be helpful but it just makes me feel worse. I had two brownies yesterday and cried about it because I felt so ashamed. Now I'm avoiding my salad because I think the lettuce tastes weird and I worry there's pesticides on it.

2025-03-14,1741974066.0,2 progesterone lab results from same day,"Hi everyone, I'm not sure I chose the best fitting flair, just wanted to share a personal experience in case anyone ever wondered.

Last week, my NP ordered hcg and progesterone labs for me after I reported some spotting after a bowel movement (I already knew I was pregnant and was just waiting for the 1st OB appt at this time). My labs were drawn around 11am. Before the results came back, the NP said they were able to see me for a quick ultrasound as well, so I returned to the office. Thankfully the spotting was considered normal and they were able to detect fetal heartbeat. It turned into a ""confirmation of pregnancy"" visit so they ordered the pregnancy panel, which included another hcg and progesterone. These labs were drawn at 3pm on the same day.

By Monday, I got all the results back. My progesterone at 11am was 16, it went up to 23 by 3pm. I've read articles about progesterone fluctuating throughout the day and I figured this was a chance to see it in action. What's funny is I requested to be prescribed progesterone after seeing the 16 and maybe it's not necessary, but it still gives me some peace of mind.",pregnant,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jb9qdz/2_progesterone_lab_results_from_same_day/
2025-03-14,1741960587.0,Kind of traumatizing doctors visit,"Is this normal?

I went in for my regular 4 week visit yesterday at 22w4d. This was only my second visit at this office, since I moved mid-pregnancy. The nurse took my blood pressure and it was slightly elevated. I let them know that I do get nervous for visits (on top of that they rush you into the back, have you pee, weigh you, then try to have a full conversation with you and then take your blood pressure). My first visit at the office, 4 weeks ago, my blood pressure was elevated the first time they took it, I think like 150/80. After sitting there for about a minute, they retook it and it dropped to 132/82. I told them my normal blood pressure, before pregnancy was about 120/80. Yesterday, the first time they took it my BP was 153/87 and then they retook it about a minute later and it was 147/83. I know these are elevated blood pressures, but I did not expect what happened next. The midwife comes into the room, we've never met her before and met with a different midwife 4 weeks ago. The first thing she says to us is ""we're sending you to triage"". My husband and I had no idea what she meant, this is our first pregnancy. I honestly thought she was joking because of how cut and dry she said it. She then told me that my BP is so concerning and saying all of these things to me that are instantly terrifying me. We have had a completely healthy pregnancy so far, with zero complications, so this came as such a shock. She was so harsh about the way she was saying things. We had previously expressed that we wanted a natural birth in their birthing center, she starts telling us that this is all at risk and that we need to make sacrifices and ""that's just how parenthood is"". We were completely shocked and scared with the way that she was talking. She didn't even ask us if we have any questions or anything, just told us the directions to OB triage at the hospital. When we got to the hospital they took my blood and had me pee in a cup and explained that they would take my blood pressure every 15 minutes for 2 hours. They wanted to check for early markers of preeclampsia. We met the triage midwife who was much nicer and well spoken. When the 2 hours was up, they prescribed me a low dose of labetalol. All of my blood tests came back negative for preeclampsia. I have no protein in my pee. The only thing going on is an elevated blood pressure. 

I guess I just want to hear from others if this is a normal thing to be sent to triage for or if it seems like an over reaction from the midwife? Also am I completely screwed from having a natural birth? Am I going to get preeclampsia no matter what?? I feel like I left with so many questions and overall just so nervous and scared. What would've been a 30 minute doctors office turned into us at the doctors/ hospital for over 3 hours. I was lucky to have the day off of work, but is this going to happen at all of my doctors visits?

2025-03-13,1741899475.0,"Newly pregnant after TTC for a year, an ectopic, and diagnosed infertility","I guess I need somewhere to spill my news of excitement and anxiety. 

My husband and I decided to TTC last year this month and we got pregnant in July, only for it to end with an ectopic pregnancy rupturing and I lost my right fallopian tube. I was diagnosed with stage 3 endometriosis during this surgery (which I never knew I had) and it had eaten through my entire fallopian tube, causing the ectopic. It was covering my ovaries and all over my insides. After my ectopic, we continued TTC with times sex and using LH strips and BBT monitoring. 

After my ectopic, I started having really short luteal phases (7-8 days) several months in a row. After pushing my OBGYN, they finally decided to run CD21 progesterone labs and discovered that my progesterone was too low to confirm ovulation each month. They tested me three months in a row and confirmed I had stopped ovulating on my own. That combined with my stage 3 endo diagnosis, I was diagnosed with infertility. 

In January, they did an endometriosis excision surgery and found that my other tube was completely clear (yay!). They ran progesterone labs again the following month and I still was not ovulating. They decided to put me on Letrozole 5mg. 

I hit one year TTC this month and my husband and I took a trip to France. I didnt have my hopes high because Im so used to disappointment and seeing negatives, but the night I got home, on 10DPO, I got a positive. 

I immediately took a digital and it came back positive too. I cant believe my first cycle on 5mg Letrozole actually worked!! I am cautiously excited because the protocol following an ectopic is to get bloodwork every 48 hours until I can get a 6 week placement scan to ensure it is not ectopic again. I have started my bloodwork and my 6 week appointment is scheduled.

For my first 2 children we found out the sex of our babies at birth, so I think I was just too focussed on actual labour and birth to be thinking about the sex! We decided to find out this time now but my husband loves making the calls when theyre born to tell everyone so were keeping it a secret just the 2 of us which is really exciting, also why I cant speak to anyone about it! 

We have 2 perfect boys, for my first I didnt really care for my second I so wanted another boy, I have a sister so I wanted the same sex bond I grew up with and I was so happy for my son that we had a boy. We always knew wed have a third. This time I dont really know how I feel, I love having boys and I know Ill adore having another one, my youngest wants a boy.

2025-03-14,1741964366.0,"Should I break up with MFM? (Labeled ""high risk"" because of IVF and 39, but textbook pregnancy so far)","Curious for this group's thoughts on MFM. In your experience, is it worth it, does it increase stress and costs unnecessarily, and does it push for interventions that aren't needed/scans that end up getting false positives? 

I'm labeled high risk at 39 as a FTM who conceived through IVF (unexplained, but very likely cervical issues). I agreed to MFM care in my first trimester because I was struggling with anxiety and happy for any additional assuring appointments. But at 22 weeks, anxiety is gone and everything is going perfectly with me and baby. I have a baby echocardiogram scheduled for 3 weeks from now, and apparently I'd start to see MFM every 2 weeks (!!) not long after that, in addition to all my OB appointments. 

I spoke with my normal GP today, who specializes in women's reproductive health, and she strongly recommended I consider bowing out of MFM care. This is given my zero indicated risk and the high likelihood that they would induce me (they told me they'd induce me before my due date) and overall push for scans and tests that often give false positives. 

She said MFM really pushes for babies to be born alive and early (pushing induction) vs. thinking about the baby's overall start in life (being able to nurse, breathe well, fight infection, etc). She sees the difference in newborn response and overall health whereas MFM and OB don't treat babies after birth, and the differences she sees between babies born 36-39 weeks vs. 40-41 weeks (especially for healthy women who eat, move, and have supportive communities) is huge. 

It's got me thinking! Anyone else avoid MFM or even extra OB intervention to avoid induction or being pressured toward induction (or just lots of expensive appointments/scans that aren't needed)?

I had been on birth control for 20 ish years and stopped taking my pill around Christmas time. I had my regular withdraw bleed on Jan 2. My husband and I both assumed it would take 3-6 months for my body to regulate and start normal cycles again. Towards the very end of January I started to feel like I was about to start my period but never did. This feeling lasted 2-3 weeks, no period, but I tested very positive on Feb 23.

I called my dr and we went to our first appointment yesterday. He seemed quite discouraged, and said that our baby was only measuring about 5-6 weeks when he felt it should be closer to 8-9. He was not able to detect a heartbeat, but has scheduled us to come back in on the 24th for a repeat ultra sound. 

This is our first baby, so we arent sure what to expect or think. I am convinced that I ovulated at the very end of January/early February, we werent really trying yet so I have to admit I wasnt tracking anything. Im just going by the clear stringing stuff that was coming out of me = sorry if TMI, but it was def the egg white discharge

 My honest feelings are telling me they are going off my last period which wasnt even a period to assume how far along we should be - which I just dont think is accurate. I feel like the 5-6 week mark is correct, in which case our baby is right on track. I have had 0 spotting this entire time btw.

What are the chances of seeing a heartbeat at that stage through a vaginal ultra sound? Should we be worried or does this sound okay? I know the worst thing to do is stress, just wondering if there is anything else I could be doing to find out if everything is going as it should be??

2025-03-13,1741895127.0,Symptoms literally ALL. OVER. THE. PLACE.,"Alright, y'all -- I'm pregnant for the third time (7 weeks 1 day today) and let me tell you, my symptoms are ALL. OVER. THE. PLACE. 

My previous two pregnancies were both so textbook-like: nausea and super crazy exhaustion starting in 1st trimester, both symptoms pretty much gone near the end of 1st trimester. Not much craziness for symptoms besides that. Both pregnancies previously were boys (now 3 &amp; 5 years old). The only main difference is that with my first pregnancy, my morning sickness wore off each day around dinner time (what a blessing!), but with my second pregnancy, I was pretty much just nauseous 24/7. =.=¨

But this pregnancy?? This pregnancy... I'm sometimes tired, sometimes EXHAUSTED, sometimes nauseous, random times of day it comes and goes, also random pains and cramps at different parts of my abdomen (mostly on the right but occasionally on the left) that also come and go...just...!? And earlier on it was lots of bloating and constipation and gas and sometimes also heartburn and now I also get bursts of mom rage but really I just feel SO all over the place. =

People I've talked to are like ""oh, it's a girl"" = which maybe it is since my boy pregnancies were both so similar and predictable but this one is so all over the place and unpredictable so far. I know you can't really predict that, but I can't help but laugh at how many people have said that to me?! Like, what?? Haha.

Also my sister had fraternal twins during her 3rd pregnancy and I'm 34 and in my 3rd pregnancy so I can't help but wonder if I'm having twins?! I'll find out next week at my first checkup (just 6 more days!) but it's definitely been on my mind.

Not looking for predictions or anything, mostly just wondering there are any other mamas out there who have had similar situations, with crazy symptoms all over the place? Even if you haven't been pregnant before your current pregnancy. Maybe this can just be a safe place for us to rant about symptoms being so random, unpredictable, and all over the place. >à

First pregnancy, went in for my anatomy scan at 20 weeks and Im 23 now and just had another because the original one couldnt see her limbs well. Everything else was normal on the first one, she was a little small but nothing crazy either 35th or 25th percentile I cant remember. On this one I did earlier this week, yesterday, they told me her head measured below the 3rd percentile and her body was the 19th. Shes still active and OB said my belly is measuring fine and heart sounds great, but Im being referred to a high risk specialist to do a more detailed ultrasound.
Im terrified. Im so scared shes not growing enough and Ive done something wrong. Recently Ive been dealing with insane amounts of stress causing inappetence and heart palpitations, but Im not underweight and Im still able to force stuff down. Dr isnt concerned with my weight or calorie intake either since its only been the past couple weeks, but what can I do?? My partner is taking over the role of taking care of the family matter thats caused so much stress (basically out of nowhere they started talking to his ex again and she doesnt like me bc she wants the dog and I have been working with him and the day she came she wanted to have him and I said not today bc I was about to go the vet in a couple hours to see if he had cancer and I wanted him to come home and relax. He does have cancer and his surgery is next week. Anyway his brother and mom and dad all love her and she came to stay with his twin brother, and then they all got together at dinner without us and started talking shit about me, doing background checks on me, trying to tell my partner Ive lied about who I was bc they couldnt find my last job and one of my degrees on it and they dont see him as much so I must be controlling and manipulating him, meanwhile Im just trying to fuckin feed myself and nest. WHOLE BIG THING) so partner is going to tell them theyre either cut off or it all stops and they need to cut the ex off. He thought I was crazy at first bc inconceivable right?? but once it all came to light he was so pissed and apologized heavily for not supporting 100% in the beginning. BESIDE THE POINT. Its put my daughter at risk and I have been an absolute mess. 
Now what?? I havent gotten the call to schedule the referral yet, my childhood friend lost her first baby at 6 months because she also stopped growing, and I dont know what I can do?

2025-03-14,1741911316.0,"Today I had the most inappropriate, violating, dismissive, condescending care ever by an MFM who has never met me before."," WARNING  If you are near Long Island, NY and you ever have a pregnancy in which you need a referral to an MFM for possible high-risk factors, DO NOT EVER go to Cecilia Avila, part of Stony Brook Medicine. Every other doctor in this practice is wonderful. I got the bad egg this time due to bad timing and luck. 

Today I received the most inappropriate and VIOLATING care Ive ever received by a doctor (keep in mind this includes the team and surgeons that *misdiagnosed my appendicitis and left my appendix in by accident*, rendering me infertile and needing IVF in the first place. I wish I had looked up her reviews beforehand. Theyre dreadful. 

Today I was supposed to see an MFM one more time as a formality to make sure I can continue under the Midwives care for the remaining 1-4 weeks of my pregnancy and deliver with them. Thats not what happened. 

Would rate negative stars if I could. She came into the room without ever greeting me or introducing herself. Without ever having met me or reviewing my chart, told me she refuses to allow me back into the SBU midwives care although I have *no high-risk factors* at 36 weeks other than my age (45) and this being an IVF pregnancy. (The baby is in perfect health and is growing on schedule. I am in perfect health, BP is fine, no GD.)

She then told me my plan to go to 40 weeks is basically killing my baby, although Id already been cleared by another MFM in the practice to do exactly that with close monitoring. The statistics for placental issues after 39 weeks for IVF/older patients are in 17/1000 births as opposed to 11/1000 births in other pregnancies. Thats still only 1.7% vs 1.1% - yes, its 42% higher than younger natural pregnancies but LOOK AT THE NUMBERS. 

She went on a rant, speaking poorly of all of these IVF patients lately who dont want induction or to go before 40 weeks and want care other than MFM. Her opinion on IVF patients desire for the least invasive options that can *safely* be done was vile and simply& wrong. Im not a monster for wanting to be under the care of midwives that are still connected to the hospital system, particularly when an OB or MFM on call at the hospital can take over at any time if medically necessary. 

The icing on the cake was when she did a RECTAL SWAB INSERTION for Group B Strep with no forewarning of what she was about to do. I understand this can be part of the process, but a decent doctor would tell the patient what she was about to do first. Had I done this at my midwife appointment, the swab wouldve been self-administered and ONLY vaginal. Not even a hello, and she was shoving a Q-tip up my ass. 

Ive never been treated like this by any medical professional  in 45 years of life. She was dismissive, haughty, condescending, rude, and violating. She does not belong seeing patients. She should be a desk doctor only, reviewing paperwork or in a lab somewhere. Her knowledge of IVF pregnancies is outdated and shes not up on the current peer-reviewed science. She bases opinions on old information and is not interested in hearing new statistics. Checking her reviews, she has told patients to TMFR without doing any actual diagnostic testing!

An MFM sees patients who are high-risk and already frightened and anxious about their pregnancies and their babies health. To treat these patients with anything other than kind, gentle, compassionate care is negligent at best, and dangerous and detrimental to both mental and physical health.

Im not a Karen. I have never reported a doctor in all of the years Ive been alive. Ive seen MANY doctors. This is the first time I have ever been treated like this. I am filing a formal complaint with Patient Advocacy as well as the home office. I plan to contact the Board as well. It seems Im not the first patient who has had this experience - but I want to make sure I am the last. No one should ever be told theyre killing their baby or have an invasive test without warning. 

I honestly have no idea who will be handling my pregnancy here on out, and its so jarring. I was almost at the finish line.

I am 38 1/2 weeks and this past weekend I got extremely sick to the point where I could barely move. The next day I was having some very weird, heavy,  and sometimes painful feeling in my uterus so I decided to go to the hospital to get checked out. I am a black woman and also big and more so on the obese side of the BMI scale and both of those things have statistically been known to cause problems for pregnant women.

Anyways while getting ready to go my partner said how can I convince you to wait longer to go? Meaning to not go at all and today told me she asked her step mom as well during that time how to convince me not to go. She said she didnt want me to take a trip to the hospital when I didnt need to. She thought, that I thought I was in labor, she said she didnt know that I felt like something was wrong, and knew that you werent in labor. =- Like what? 

Either way how could someone want to convince their partner not go get checked out if they feel they need to. Im in disbelief that she would even go out of her way to try and find a way to convince me not to go. Ive had multiple near death experiences throughout my life and already dont have a good track record with doctors listening to me in the first place leading to almost catastrophic consequences.

I went back into triage around 7:15 after not being able to relieve the pain through a hot shower, heat packs, or relaxing.

Im feeling immediate relief and two hours later I feel like I could already slowly walk a marathon around the hospital. Pain is minimal and my nurses are telling me how amazing it is that Im so okay. Were over the moon and bonding, though husband is sad about missing the birth by minutes.

Then I wake up at 2am that first night covered in sweat and shaking so badly I cant safely pick up my baby. Call the nurse, and I have a temp of 102 but no pain or other symptoms of anything. The nurses and midwife are stumped because aside from the fever they track over 2 days, Im perfectly fine. No stomach pain, minimal bleeding, no discomfort. They do rounds of blood work and even send me down for a CT scan the night of the 11th.

And find appendicitis. So I have my baby on the 9th and my appendix removed on the 12th. And after the recovery, our planned 2 day hospital stay turned into 5. But were home now and adjusting, and in a way it all feels like some weird fever dream, going from 4 to 10 centimeters in about an hour. Im in more pain from the surgery than the delivery, but baby is healthy and thriving and thats all that really matters.

2025-03-14,1741957343.0,Pregnancy ruined my teeth,"* I dont need advice 

I want to preface this by saying I did have dental issue prior to my first pregnancy but it was manageable at the time. This is a direct result of my pregnancy. Anyways I had my second baby last year (2 under 2) and one of the most disheartening things has been my teeth. I have to get dental implants because my pregnancy cost me my bottom molars on both side. During my pregnancy I had HG which made me severely anemic, malnourished, and stressed. I would grind my teeth at night, threw up at any time especially early morning, and I couldnt stomach tooth paste. I couldnt take my prenatal either because even after trying 7 different brands I would vomit to the point of bleeding after taking them. Which means my babies took the calcium they needed from me. On top of everything I was so depressed that I barely cared once I noticed my teeth literally cracking (was speaking out pieces of teeth). With this combination my teeth were destroyed with the latest being pulled last month. I hate to smile now because my teeth have cracks, chips, and holes in most of my teeth. I lost my job during my first pregnancy so I have basic dental care through medicaid which doesnt cover the work I need. I love my babies dearly but I didnt know it would cost me my smile in so many ways. Emotionally and mentally I barely want to smile and now its a physical reason that my smile feels horrible. Please take your prenatals, please push your doctors to check your levels to insure youre not deficient anywhere, and do remember that pregnancy is harsh. Never have a baby for any reason other than YOU wanting that baby because it can cost you in ways you never wouldve thought. I had my babies for me of course but the cost hit really fast.

So um. Nobody prepared me for the pain that comes with contractions. The pain will be different for everyone of course, but in my experience contractions started off like bad abdominal period cramps for a day, very tolerable. The following day.. they progressed to my back and it felt like someome was using all their force and swinging a baseball bat into my tailbone/lower back =5=« HOLY F!! No one prepares you for that. I just remember thinking God PLEASE help me!  and all you can do is shut your eyes as tight as they allow and groan through it. 

I finally went to the hospital that second night and next came the cervical check. The cervical check to me, felt like a sharp hot knife entering your vagina.. WTFFF. I instantly started sobbing and asked the nurse to please stop, and that i dont want to have a cervical check done. She told me she barely even went in but i was sobbing uncontrollably, i couldnt catch my breath, the pain was like nothing ive ever felt before. They had to convince me to get a cervical check with the help of fentanyl. Once I got the fentanyl, I was able to tolerate a cervical check. I was 6cm dilated. Thank you God for modern medicine! 

The pain absolutely wiped me out, I just wanted to sleep in between each contraction, my eyes would shut from all the pain and my body wanted me to fall asleep because it took every ounce of energy out of me. But then another contraction would beat you up awake again =5=«=-


My pain tolerance must be so low! I got the epidural shortly after being admitted... epidural = pure bliss.

I'm not high risk,  nor have I had any complications other than terrible pregnancy sickness.  

The anxiety is just horrible, I have stomach issues, even before pregnancy and I was warned the scar tissue could turn cancerous if I don't take care of myself so I already have a chance of dying it feels like.  (I've been puking stomach acid this while pregnancy, I know it's getting worse I can feel the pain from time to time) 

No matter what my bf thinks, I'm going to tell the Dr to deliver my baby that if any complications arise, save me before, baby.  We can have another kid. My mom can't have another me.  I never wanted to be a mom, so I had no intention of dying for a child I didn't want.

I'm worried my bf will hate me for saying that, but I've said since we met, I didn't want kids.  This pregnancy was not planned, and he's the ""God gave us this kid for a reason"" type of guy.  So, he probably would've left me had I went through with  the termination.  Of all the women out there PRAYING for a baby, why did it have to be ME that gets one??


Edit
He is not using me for a baby.  That's not what happened.  The condom broke, and I got pregnant.  I told him from the beginning that if I'd accidentally fall  pregnant, I wasn't sure if I'd keep it.  But, he proved to me that he isn't like my father was to me. He'll be a great dad.  We were together for a while before it happened, I know him like the back of my hand.  And he knows me like the back of his hand.  We never argued or fought once. We had disagreements, but it was settled quickly without any problems.  I wanted it to be us for a while longer before we had kids if we got to that point.

(I'm 25) and thought she was a lil odd when she started texting in it daily after the 3 of us hung out once for an hour this past NYE. Any who, I found out I was pregnant Feb 2nd and we had never spoke of babies up until I found out I was preggo. She got completely fixated on that and did everything she could to suddenly get pregnant shortly after. She would send messages almost nightly about how she just got 'creampied' and give like all these details of how she was keeping the semen inside to get preggo. And then suddenly she said she and her boyfriend had been trying for a while to get pregnant and it never worked..... Well she sent a positive test probably around 2 weeks ago and she found out when she was like 8 days pregnant and had booked an ultrasound the day of at PP. Freaked out because they couldn't see the baby (because she literally just got pregnant but for some reason lied and told them she was 4 weeks pregnant) and has just been fucking non stop ever sense. I caught her lying about her saying her boyfriend was 'actively' trying to get her pregnant for a while, because now that she is he's not excited because hes 23 and he said he wasn't planning to have a baby and basically just said she started getting crazy about it out of nowhere....... I shit you not she has been daily been sending messages EVEN AT 9 DAYS PREGNANT about having food aversions, nausea, all this stuff but then when she was worried that they didn't see anything at 8 days pregnant she admitted she hasn't had any symptoms so she was concerned that they were saying they didn't see any signs of a fetus. It's just been so weird. Every day she's been non stop and normally I would be excited to have someone to relate to but I feel like she is pushing it all so hard. I struggled so bad between weeks 6-9 and she just doesn't understand idk. I'm sure she's starting to have symptoms at 4 weeks, but every single day its something but then shes out doing a whoooooole bunch of stuff which I feel like contradicts what she says and I just find it hard to believe how authentic shes being about it all because shes just been weirding me out entirely honestly. every day she just talks about herself nonstop and will go on and on and on &amp; not pick up social cues of when to stop and sometimes its like overly detailed and TMI??? She once sent a photo of toilet paper after she wiped to show her discharge ?

We were all talking in the chat today and she of course is already just going on and on and on about how shes already created her baby registry and shes going to start sending it out and she sent it in the chat to my friend &amp; I, and she was just saying how excited she is etc and I responded saying I'm just nervous because its a complete life change and something I've obviously never done before (she hasn't either) and that i hope i will be a good mom etc and she responded this entire paragraph saying this"" sometimes being a mother isn't meant for everyone, you really have to consider if this is the right choice for you, it is going to be a life altering decision, and a addition to your life that once its here it is truly your responsibility. you are a very young girl and you already have a lot of animals, if you genuinely don't think being a mother is something your going to want to do for the next 16 years until they get their license, its okay to wait a bit longer. i don't want to stress you out but there are going to be sacrifices. this is legit the rest of your life that's going to be changed. god forbid they do a sport that you hate."" and i was honestly appalled by this message. She made me feel like i was SO out of line for saying I'm genuinely nervous to be a mother and i get anxious thinking about it sometimes. Like who are you to tell me that at all? Idk. The girl just rubs me wrong honestly. Or maybe I'm just a bitch.

My OB wanted to induce because while I do not have GD or diabetes, I do have a strong family history of diabetes and gained 6 pounds in between the 3 weeks of my last appointments. OB wanted to be safe rather than sorry and scheduled me for 39 weeks, which I agreed with.

This was my second pregnancy. My first came at 38 weeks, water breaking but no contractions so I was given pitocin and other meds to help me along. My epidural never really worked the way it was supposed to and by the time my 26 hour labor (1 hour pushing) was over I could transfer myself to my own gurney. I also felt a lot of pain while pushing. 

For this baby my OB said she'd give me the epidural whenever i was ready. I opted when I was around 3-4cms. They didn't give me pitocin until the epidural was working, which was such a game changer. She did break my water before but the cervix check hurt more than that. We got the epidural placed and all was well. I started feeling my right leg though, as well as contractions on that side of my stomach, and had to tell a nurse three times before she got the anesthesiologist to come back and look at it. 

Once it was pulled back and adjusted my pain was gone. They said I could probably push if I was ready and 5 minutes later, my baby was born.

I asked for an elective induction on my due date for my second pregnancy. I actually drove myself to the hospital and begged to be induced ha. They agreed (I guess labor and delivery was slow that day.) We tried a membrane sweep the week prior and nothing. I was just done being pregnant, I had a rough and painful (had to start leave from work a month earlier than expected because my hip pain was so bad I could barely walk) third trimester. Pregnancy was otherwise really healthy/ uncomplicated. Ive had one previous vaginal delivery (spontaneous labor at 39 weeks after membrane sweep). Relatively uncomplicated hospital birth (20hrs in labor, 30min pushing, second degree tear, normal recovery. I did have terrible back labor though but once I got the epidural I felt nothing).

My husband met me at the hospital and we had lunch and then walked over to L&amp;D. We got checked in and found out I was already 5cm dilated. Got started in pitocin and started having contractions. I BARELY felt the contractions though they felt like mild period cramps but could see them in the monitor. My husband and I happily hung out and watched tv for three hours (we joked it was the first date wed been on in months ha). 

After a few hours the contractions started to hurt a but more so I asked for an epidural. By the time i got the epidural they were pretty painful but i was able to breathe through it all. Epidural worked and dulled the pain a bit (not as strong as the one id had with my first delivery). Nurse checked my cervix (7cm now) and accidentally broke my water. 

I IMMEDIATELY felt the need to push/ excruciating pressure. She checked me again, lo and behold I was at 10cm. 

I pushed like 4 times and my healthy baby girl was born 8 minutes later. The midwife barely had time to get to the room. I didnt tear at all! They removed the epidural and I basically felt totally normal& 

Shockingly easy recovery, was out to lunch with friends a few days later& 

It felt like the epidural didnt work below my belly but honestly the pushing part was so fast it was fine. I also wonder if I didnt tear because I could feel everything& Anyways, I hope any future birth I may have goes exactly like this again.

2025-03-13,1741893214.0,Finally had my boy,It seems so unreal to say that I'm sitting here holding my boy at a week old. My boy that we thought would never exist but now that he's safely here it's nice to tell our little story. From the time I was 17 I was told I'd never be able to have kids because of severe endometriosis and pcos and was absolutely devastated because I always knew I wanted babies seeing as I had helped raise babies since I was 12. Fast forward to 27 and finding out I was pregnant for the first time and crying so hard because it finally happened.  Unfortunately for my husband and I we lost our angel at 8 weeks and I felt like my whole world was crashing around us. It felt like there was our only chance after 7 years together struggling and hoping.  Then last year happened. Exactly a year after we lost our baby we found out we were pregnant again.  To say I was terrified would be an understatement always wondering if something would go wrong. Always looking to each appointment to make sure baby boy was ok. Every appointment we waited for the other shoe to drop. We just tried to enjoy the time we had while hoping everything would stay healthy. Then at 39 weeks and 5days contractions finally started after what felt like an eternity. At 39 and 6 after only 12 hours of labor our little miracle rainbow made his appearance and it still seems unreal. All this to say i am grateful to have my little man with me and have truly enjoyed being in this group and letting myself have hope after reading so many others stories. d,pregnant,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jak39u/finally_had_my_boy/

2025-03-14,1741954896.0,Innocently annoying ass coworker,"Hello, FTM here. My mood swings were in full swing before I even knew i was preggy. They've been getting better in my 2nd trimester, however, I have a coworker who irritates theeee shiiiiit out of me. She's actually SO NICE, but she reeks of ""desperation""... I can't think of a different or better word... of wanting to ""fit in"" &amp; be a part of every conversation... its irritating.. we are at work, I'm inquiring about something work related &amp; she manages to squeeze in a comment regarding something outside of work.. just to say it... or just to have an interaction.. and the bosses have new rules now &amp; she sarcastically brings them up, OFTEN. Like okay, jokes old already &amp; I don't want to fake laugh, just bc i feel bad.. also, she was calling my baby ""peanie"" the entire first trimester.. just a horrid nickname..not cute..and in the sonogram, baby didn't even LOOK like a peanut.. if it did, call it peanut.. not peanie... bc wth is that? I asked her to stop. My aunt also called it peanut.. I literally asked, ""where does it look like a peanut?"" ... its annoying as shit.

Anyway, back to coworker (who I've known since hs.. we are in our mid 30s now)

Examples:
1. How's peanie? Idk...... good, I hope!
2. Go eat, you're eating for two now.... no, I'm not.. and I don't eat unless I feel hungry or it's been a while since I've eaten. Even so, just bc I feel a slight twinge of hunger, doesn't mean I have to go stuff my face.
3. When im walking away from my work station, ""don't forget to clock out &amp; not waste company time.. or you'll get fired"" (jokes old already! .) - ""don't forget to clock out before you use the bathroom"" - all sarcastic joking comments, and only she's laughing.. legit laughing.. and im like.. this isn't even funny to me.. enough already.. 
4. Talking about work related shit &amp; she wants to throw in, ""we need a girl day"" . . . Or some personal stressful detail about her life, COMPLETELY irrelevant from the work related shit im talking about.. not even a conversation starter, just legit one sentence. One comment. Just to say it.
5. Talking about food and how hungry she is ALL THE TIME and then comments about how good the food was or how bad it messed up her belly.. comments on it FOR HOURS throughout the workday.. I've turned into a ""that's crazy"" person.... &amp; a ""don't make eye contact"" person, otherwise, she's blurting out ""those empanadas were so good.. I want more"" ..... SO GET THEM! It's like why do you have to say something every single time i face your direction? Like idc!
6. I had a browning banana on my desk and she tells me, ""you better eat that before it goes bad.."" - I said i will if I want it, but if it goes bad, I'll toss it. I'm not afraid to throw food away if i need to.. I'm not a food hoarder and I don't eat every single moment I'm hungry or just bc food is in front of me. 
7. She thinks just bc I'm pregnant I'm supposed to be eating like a cow... I was telling her something about me and my bf eating and she inquires about my bf, ""he eats as much as you?""  - B%#$* !! first of all, I'm not heavy. I love my body, I think I'm pretty =% hot, &amp; I feel good about myself in a world where what we see online can make us feel like pure shit. Even if i was heavy, juicy,.... a voluptuous woman.. id still feel sexy. however, I do not look like I overeat.. at all. So that comment implies that just bc I'm expecting, I eat more than my 5""11 190lb weight lifting BF !? I can barely eat with all of my food aversions. I'm 5'3, always bloated in belly (prior to pregnancy) due to PCOS.. but to say that shit...  my blood boiled. The assumptions are crazy annoying. Just bc im pregnant, you're simply going to assume i cant control my food intake. Wth. 
8. She suffers from anxiety, I'm someone who worries here and there, has fears, like anyone else... especially as a FTM and possible complications etc. I was so nervous in the beginning of this pregnancy... and so she would make comments like, ""people like us"" or ""you know how our mind works"" ... associating me with an anxiety disorder. It's like she took my valid ass fears or worries.. and moments* of anxiety... to compare to HER &amp; associates with anxiety
9. Tells my worker (who trusts my pallet) that as long as she sits next to me, she's going to gain weight. (Again, not bc I'm heavy.. she just think bc I'm pregnant, I eat like a savage) mind you I have 2 meals a day bc so many food thoughts turn me off.) You're not about to blame me for my food recommendations*** &amp; if someone chooses to eat it.. and gains weight, ""blame her"" .. you're not cute or funny. Bc what you're saying isn't even true! If it were true, it wouldn't bother me.

All this shit IRKS me &amp; I can't control the annoyed feelings.

We were planning on taking a vow to spend the rest of our lives together before we conceived, but this has accelerated our timeframe.

When we found out she said now our engagement photos are going to have a baby bump in a negative tone - were happy that it happened but she doesnt want to give the public impression that were getting married because I knocked her up. We have told friends or family about the baby or the engagement and although Im fine with it, she wants to delay making it public for as long as possible, so I want to respect that. 

Ideally Id like to propose in June on a beach when the weathers nice but shell have a baby bump then. 

From your collective experience, whats the latest that I should propose? Can I make it until May? 

Im planning on asking one of her friends to take pictures& and subtly suggest she wears will cover a small baby bump.

I was diagnosed with a short cervix and SCH almost a week ago after having lots of pink and brown discharge/mucus with blood clots along with some mild cramping. I went to the ER (mind you this was my third doctor visit in a week to find out whats wrong.) They spotted a SCH that had some blood and debri, they assured me that was where the extra nasty discharge was probably coming from. They told me that should pass on its own. They then noticed how short my cervix was. It was at a 2.3-2.5. They kept me overnight with the TOCO machine to spot any early contractions and had me on progesterone all night to see if it helped. The high risk doctor measured my cervix the next morning and it was a 3.1. He was more confident that things were better but still wanted to follow up in a few days to check on things. They prescribed me progesterone and Ive been on it for 5 days now. I went back to the doctor today for a follow up. My cervix is measuring at 1. They are assuming the progesterone wasnt doing so well and are highly suggesting a cerclage. Ive took it very easy the past few days and missed a bunch of work and been on bed rest (my decision.) Im not sure what caused the cervix to get that bad so quickly. Im going to be admitted again tonight. They are going to put me back on the toco machine to check for contractions and put me on more medication tonight to prepare for surgery tomorrow. God willing. The doctor told me she has seen a lot of success with cerclages but she has also been there for cases that still had a bad outcome where they went into pre term labor and couldnt stop it regardless of the cerclage. She made sure I knew that if that were the case, the baby wouldnt survive and at this point they are definitely concerned of that happening. They are going to do anything preventative they can.

Im currently 9 weeks and 4 days pregnant with my first baby. After my first prenatal appointment, I received unexpected news from my employer that we need to return to the office after nearly three years of working remotely. I was devastated because I had hoped to work from home during my pregnancy and through my babys first year, but here we are.

I spoke with my doctor about it, and she gave me some great advice to make the transition easier, like treating myself to lunch nearby, listening to my favorite podcast on the commute, and finding small ways to make the experience more pleasant. That helped me mentally prepare, but Im still struggling with first-trimester fatigue, sleepiness, food aversions, and all the fun symptoms that come with early pregnancy. I have been told things get better in the second trimester, so Im hopeful.

Now, I have the option to work either:

* 5 days a week, 8 hours a day
* 4 days a week, 10 hours a day with 3-day weekends

I would love to hear from others who have worked a flex schedule while pregnant. For context, I'm a software developer. My commute would be 45 - 60 minutes. Would working four longer days be worth it for the extra day off, or would the longer shifts be too exhausting? I understand that everyone is different and experiences may vary.

I discovered I was pregnant on Feb 26th; I'd had what I thought was a light period on January 29th-30th-31st, but it turns out that must have been implantation bleeding. I thought I was only 10 days late for my period based on the timing of that bleed, but it turns out I was much further along. I hadn't had many symptoms except for very sore breasts, some tiredness and loss of appetite, all of which I tend to get before my cycle anyway, so I didn't clue in right away.

I'm in a solid, loving relationship, but we just aren't currently in a situation to add to our family. I have a young child from my previous relationship, and we live in a fairly modest apartment, and for many other reasons it just wouldn't be right to add to the family right now. 

I was a bit panicked when I found out I was pregnant, but my partner was incredibly supportive and understanding. I called my doctor the same day and was referred to our local hospital which has a program for women seeking termination. My partner brought me to the appointment, which was on Wednesday of this week. I'm based in Canada and so it was a very calm and non-judgmental environment; I'm grateful to the doctor and nurse who walked me through my options and explained everything to me.

I was given an ultrasound and blood test the same day and they determined I was at exactly 10 weeks and 0 days, the cutoff for using medical termination in my province. They mentioned I could either schedule a surgical termination for the following week, or do the medical termination as long as I was willing to take the first pill that day. I decided on the medical because I wanted to end the pregnancy as soon as possible - my last pregnancy and birth process were extremely traumatic, and being pregnant again was giving me nightmares and flashbacks, so I couldn't handle the thought of waiting any longer.

Timeline:

6:00 pm Wednesday: took the mifepristone dose as directed. Had some very mild cramping starting about two hours later, which continued the following day.

1:00 pm Thursday: developed a headache, had some additional cramping and mildly upset stomach through the rest of the afternoon.

6:00 pm: took 10 mg ketorolac with a small amount of food.

6:45 pm: took 4 Misoprostol tablets in the cheek for 30 minutes as directed, washed down with water afterwards.

9:00 pm: started having some mild cramping which came in waves, slight chills. Very mild nausea which didn't last. Watched TV with partner and just tried to relax.

10:00 pm: started having some light spotting, cramps continuing. Cramps felt like my worst period day, nothing too major. Chills and started to have diarrhea.

10:45 pm: listened to an audiobook and went to sleep.

11:30 pm: woke up to a strange sensation, felt almost like my hands weren't attached to my body. Felt something shift in my lower abdomen, then a rush of fluid. Fortunately I was wearing heavy duty period undies in addition to a pad already and had no leakage. Went to the bathroom expecting pure blood but discovered it was pink tinted fluid which I assume was water breaking. Pad completely saturated. Pain very minimal.

As soon as I sat down on the toilet I felt something drop out. Had the sensation of needing to push, did so and a much larger clump came rushing out, along with quite a bit of blood. Peeked into the toilet and could see a ring shaped clot, and noticed a light pink thing partially submerged in the blood. It was not pleasant to see and I could tell it was part of a leg/lower torso of the embryo, extremely small but unmistakable.

Had a bit of a cry. Said I was sorry. Remembered what some of the other women have said on here about their babies becoming part of the water. I did not want to be pregnant, but I couldn't help but have feelings about it. I stayed for a while before saying goodbye and flushing.

1:30 am: woke up again, mild cramping and passed some more clots. Took a second ketorolac. Came back to bed and fell asleep easily.

6:00 am: woke up at my normal time, immediately felt different than I'd been feeling for the last few weeks. Breasts still a little sore but pain noticeably reduced from how they had been feeling prior. Did not have the morning upset stomach, and was able to enjoy a coffee (I'd been having aversion to it for about three weeks). Actually had energy as opposed to feeling extremely fatigued. Had moderate amount of blood on the pad and a few tiny clots when going to the bathroom, similar to a day 2 period.

10:30 am (present): cramps have almost completely subsided, have not needed more ketorolac. Ate some breakfast. Still have what is similar to a day 2 period. Energy is much higher than it normally is at this time of the morning.

I will still need to monitor for unusual bleeding, signs of infection, or increasing pain, and will need a follow up to confirm everything has passed, but ultimately the process was not what I expected. I originally worried that 4 Misoprostol wouldn't be sufficient, given that I was 10 weeks along and I've seen stories on here of women needing double the dose. I was worried it wasn't working initially as it took quite some time for the bleeding to start.

For anyone facing this situation right now: just know that you aren't alone. You are doing what is best for your body, and if you aren't ready to give up everything for a baby it means you're doing the right thing for your baby too. Sending healing thoughts and wishes to all of you who are reading this and feeling scared - you can do this if you need to.",abortion,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jb5i23/positive_ma_experience_10w_0d/

I am 21, from the United States, and I thought I was doing what was right for me. I still believe that to be the case (I'm active duty military, still in school, and not mentally ready for a baby), but as the days go by I keep thinking about how things might have been. I still have the pregnancy tests from when I found out and I can't bring myself to get rid of them. 

I found out on March 1st, had my MA on the 7th. It all happened so fast that I didn't allow myself to feel any of the emotions until now. From the moment I found out, I had a gut feeling that it would have been a girl. After the initial shock, I accepted the fact that I was pregnant and grew attached to the life I was growing, even though I was only five weeks. I feel like I shouldn't be having these emotions, because it wasn't actually a baby, but I do. I don't have much of a support group (my fiance seems annoyed whenever I try to talk about it, my mother - though supportive - is very emotional and cries if I cry) so I'm mostly dealing with this alone.

2025-03-13,1741901137.0,boyfriend left 3 months after abortion,"I'm really just looking for emotional support, I've been going to therapy, talking to friends, but wanted to come into this space to see if others have had similar situations.

Backstory: My boyfriend was 13 years younger than me, I have 2 kids from a previous marriage, this was really the first time I was in love with someone again after my divorce which was a couple years out at this point. We got pregnant after seeing each other for about 3 months. At the time, it felt like an relatively easy answer. Never totally easy, especially as a mom, I know what it's like to go through pregnancy and give birth and love my babies, but I went ahead and opted for a MA right away. It ended up being fairly traumatic though, because it didn't work. I had to go in and get an ultrasound to confirm, and then went on to get a D&amp;C as soon as I could after that. So yeah, totally sucked, definitely left a mark on me more so than I would have expected. 

Fast-forward a few months later: I was on birth control pills now, and end up getting pregnant AGAIN anyways. This time, I'm feeling the effects of the previous experience, my boyfriend and I are much more stable and in love as a couple. I'm not really too spiritual but the chances of all this happening really floored me. I felt so much more protective of this pregnancy, big mama bear energy. Like I wanted to meet this person. I even started looking into open adoptions and contemplated what it would be like to raise a baby on my own, which honestly I felt pretty confident about. My boyfriend was freaked out, and basically gave me an ultimatum saying that if I went and kept the pregnancy he doesn't know if he could stay with me romantically at that point. I felt SO in love with this person that as soon as he said that, that was it, I felt so committed to our relationship and was like, I can't blame him for feeling this way, I get he was young and freaking out, but I choose him and our relationship. Had a harder time getting over this abortion, got depressed, the holidays were really rough for me. I was having a ton of depression and anxiety during this time. Then in January, about 3 months after the abortion, he broke up with me. 

It's been a couple months later, and I'm just SO angry and hurt. I'm such a loyal partner and I'm just so confused. I also hate the fact that this is causing me pain and I think about this all the time and I'm sure he hasn't even realized or given it a second thought. I usually have a lot of compassion for people, like if he needed to leave the relationship, I get it, but the timing still feels so awful, it still feels like I made a huge sacrifice for nothing. I feel like I want some kind of justice, but I know the healthy thing is to forgive him and move on.

2025-03-14,1741939059.0,My experience with surgical abortion,"Hello, I wanted to share my experience with a surgical abortion as I know reading other peoples experience helped ease my mind when I was going through it. It's quite detailed, feel free to skip straight to the abortion para, or the end if you just want the key takeaways. (I'm not going to be talking about the morality or debating, if you are pro-life this post isn't for you.)

PRE-ABORTION: I'm 23, I found out I was pregnant at 4 weeks, this was unplanned, I went to a doctor to discuss my options and was told if i wanted to terminate the pregnancy I had to be 5/6 weeks before I could have the pill. To schedule my abortion I called a woman's clinic and was recommended the surgical abortion from them which I was happier with having spoken to 2 people who had the medical one who both said they would recommend I do surgical instead. (I have a low pain tolerance and health anxiety so this made the most sense for me). For the next 2 weeks I had morning sickness and an intense fatigue accompanied with a lack of appetite and just genuinely feeling nauseous and exhausted all the time. 

ABORTION: The day of my abortion I was just over 5 weeks pregnant, when I got to the clinic i was initially in a waiting room, my boyfriend was with me, as I was going under anesthesia and so you have to have someone to drive you home and stay with you for the next 4 hours minimum. I was called in for the first part of it and was given the option to bring him with me up until the actual procedure, which i took. In this part I had an ultrasound where I saw the fetus (I wasn't asked if this is something I wanted to see), then I signed consent forms saying i wouldn't drive, understood the risks etc... 

Then I went into the next room where i spoke to the doctor who was going to be carrying out the abortion. There was a sign on the wall saying ""sometimes hard decisions are the right ones,"" which I liked. She asked me about contraception in the future and when i said condoms she accepted it without question and didn't try to pressure me into hormonal birth control which I've experienced with male doctors in the past. (We didnt use a condom the time I accidentally conceived). She then explained the procedure and that they would essentially be sucking it out of my uterus.  Next i spoke to the anesthesiologist who answered any of my questions regarding that. 

For the procedure I was given a lightweight pink robe instead of a hospital gown, a nurse took me through to the operating room. There was 3 people in total: nurse, doctor and anesthesiologist. I was freaking out at this point and they were compassionate with me and told me when the needle was going in, I began to get groggy and then they put a mask on my face and that was the last thing I remembered.

I woke up in a separate room, made private by a curtain, very groggy and confused, I was laying on a bed with a hot water bottle on my stomach. A nurse came in, asked me how i was feeling and if i wanted painkillers, to which i said yes. The pain wasn't that bad it was like period cramping I more so felt strange. They then offered me coffee/tea/juice and brought in a pack of biscuits and brought my boyfriend in to sit with me as the anesthesia started to wear off. I was there about 30/40 minutes from waking up before we were discharged. For the rest of the day I slept/ watched tv on the couch and took it really slow, as i was very tired. I have only had very minimal bleeding and light cramping since the procedure. The nausea and morning sickness went away instantly. I was given a course of antibiotics for 6 days to prevent infection as that is one of the most common side effects so i have taken one of them every day but for the most part I was fine after with very minimal pain (i used a hot water bottle, didn't need painkillers).

  
Overall I would say it went as well as it could and the procedure itself is nothing to be afraid of as you are in good hands and they do these things every single day multiple times a day, and I have a low pain tolerance and I really had very little (which was one of my main concerns). 

The only other thing to note was price, it was expensive, $700 Aud with Medicare but as i didn't have it i was $1200 out of pocket. ",abortion,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jayr3g/my_experience_with_surgical_abortion/
2025-03-14,1741960952.0,My worst nightmare pregnant two post abortion US,"Well I got positive again.. my husband had reschedule his v surgery last month because the doctor went on vacation. I had decided I would track my period and we would avoid sex on ovulation or near it. But some how I guess I failed at that. I didnt want get on bc because of how it effects me mentally and I have already have mental health issues. So I thought I could track and that way Id prevent pregnancy and avoid getting on bc until his surgery that is now this month. I was told it was good way to avoid pregnancy if you didnt want to be on birth control. I figured I could handle that. We have literally had sex maybe three times at max in the last three months just trying to be cautious. I have two kids and my last baby I got car sick with. Two days ago I felt car sick and nauseous the next morning and I thought no way. Im still three days away from my period but I never get car sick expect when Im pregnant so that thought was eating me up so just to ease my mind I thought Id take a test. The way I felt sick immediately after getting the positive. Now my son birthday party is tomorrow and I have to make it through that whole time knowing Ive got so this all over again. My head wants to blame my husband because he was supposed to get V surgery over this past year and he put it off and of course when he finally gets it scheduled he had to reschedule. But two abortion back to back feels sick in my head because I know I could have prevented it and just got in bc in the mean time but besides just my mental health I didnt want my huband using me being on bc asa cop out. Not saying he has before but I thought it would make him push off my V more so if he felt I could get pregnant again ( he also doesnt want anymore kids) he would be motivated to get it done. Now I have to do the walk of shame to planned parenthood again I feel so embarrassed. The doctor there really encouraged me to get on bc and now look at me. I could break down crying. This sucks so bad and Im sorry to myself and my body. Im sorry to this baby that I cant keep. I physically couldnt carry a baby anyways anymore because after my last baby, I was told my uterus is so thin they couldnt tell the difference from a uterus in the sack. The baby was in and that I was lucky she had even made it to 36 weeks without my uterus bursting. It was due to devious c-section I have a lot scar tissue and it has sheered out my uterus. So I dont really have a choice but at the same time I had a choice to get in bc but my stupidity and choices have led me back to this. Im so sorry.

2025-03-13,1741894005.0,im torn whether to get an abortion (CA),"Im 18 years old and in college. Im 10 1/2 weeks pregnant and have an appointment to get an abortion tomorrow (pills). But I have so much fear and anxiety around it. I told my mom and grandma I was pregnant at 3 weeks right after I found out. They were very supportive and my mom and stepdad would adopt the baby. They have two young children (under 4 years old), so my baby would be in their age range. Im also due the week before next school year starts so my pregnancy doesnt affect my schooling. When I first found out, I was so scared and nervous, but loved my baby immediately. At 6 weeks I had an ultrasound and saw the little blob and I felt so much excitement, even though I knew I would never get to raise it. HOWEVER, the issue is, my partner does not want this child. In the beginning he told me I had to get an abortion and at 6 weeks when we made the appointment to go to Planned Parenthood, I couldnt take the first pill. I sobbed and sobbed and begged him to not make me do this and he did not care. We had many fights before that appointment and after that appointment where he told me Im an awful selfish person if I keep the child and how its not okay to gamble on a childs happiness, as it will be adopted by its biological grandmother and still have contact with its birth mother (me). Sorry this is kind of all over the place, but at 4 weeks I told him I was keeping it and so he yelled at me about how much he hated me then left. I freaked out so I told him if he comes back Ill get an abortion. After the appointment where I couldnt take the pills, he left again. And for those two weeks where he was gone I have never been more depressed and lonely. I just missed him so much and wanted a partner in this. My first trimester was really really really rough (nausea, vomiting, MAJOR cramping, flu, sinus infection, ear infections, fatigue). I just began doubting if I could really survive these next 7 1/2 months and that maybe an abortion is whats best. He agreed, as he thinks its selfish to develop the embryo into a child. He said if i get an abortion hell be there for me 24/7 and whenever I need and do whatever I need but Im very unsure. Lately, I constantly cry about loving my baby and he just corrects me saying its an embryo still. But at the same time, if I get an abortion we would be together, wed live together over the summer, wed go on trips&but I know Ill regret it for the rest of my life. My biggest dream has been to have children and I know I wont be able to raise this child, but Im so attached already. I know Ill look at my future children and wonder what if. He says my regret will pass but I adamantly dont think it will& Im unsure what to do. I feel like Im choosing short term suffering over long term suffering. I cant talk to my family about this because they are pro life, so they would not be thrilled with my actions. I just dont know what to do.

2025-03-14,1741941564.0,Abortion Is Okay Because Its Their Choice,"At the end of the day, abortion is a personal decision, and no one should be forced to stay pregnant against their will. Pregnancy is a major medical event that affects a persons body, health, future, and life in ways that only they can fully understand. No one else has to experience the physical pain, the risks, the emotional toll, or the lifelong consequences of giving birthso why should anyone else get to decide?

Some argue that a fetus has a right to life, but even if we grant that, no one has the right to use another persons body without consent. We dont force people to donate organs, even if it would save a life. If bodily autonomy applies to everyone else, why should it suddenly stop applying to pregnant people?

People get abortions for all kinds of reasonsfinancial instability, medical risks, being too young, not wanting to be a parent, or simply not wanting to be pregnant. And they shouldnt have to justify it. No one is obligated to give up their body for someone else, and pregnancy should be no exception.

Here is how it will work: Nano-bots are placed inside the female reproductive system. They work by monitoring the reproductive system for new, unique human DNA. If fertilization occurs, and such unique DNA is detected, the cell containing it is destroyed by the nano-bot. 

Not only does this stop 100% of unintended pregnancies when used, they are perfectly safe for the AFAB person as they only attack unknown, unique human DNA. And, it's completely reversible, simply through remote control.

Im kinda nervous because my bump is absolutely huge and everyone asks if Im having twins.

My pre pregnancy weight was around 59kg and Im about 58. Im a fairly narrow or petite build. I went down to 56kg from nausea and vomiting at 9 weeks.

I was 74KG at 31 weeks and now Im 34 weeks(havent checked yet tbh too scared to)!! >u. So Ive gained about 15 kg from my pre pregnancy weight only at 31 weeks. The midwife didnt seem to think anything of it.

Bub was always measuring slightly big. First he was 75th percentile and then he rose up to the 85th by 27 weeks. Not sure what he will be now but they are checking next week.

Im already really struggling with walking and back issues. I actually needed crutches a few weeks ago from my SI joint popping out of place and Im still really struggling with back pain. 

Im wondering if any of you had a similar experience with weight gain and what the outcome was?

Im secretly hoping for an ealryish labour because I feel like I physically cannot keep up with the weight. I also live in a subtropical climate so the heat makes it almost unbearable. ",pregnant,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jb21fx/did_having_a_big_baby_and_excessive_weight_gain/

2025-03-14,1741974066.0,2 progesterone lab results from same day,"Hi everyone, I'm not sure I chose the best fitting flair, just wanted to share a personal experience in case anyone ever wondered.

Last week, my NP ordered hcg and progesterone labs for me after I reported some spotting after a bowel movement (I already knew I was pregnant and was just waiting for the 1st OB appt at this time). My labs were drawn around 11am. Before the results came back, the NP said they were able to see me for a quick ultrasound as well, so I returned to the office. Thankfully the spotting was considered normal and they were able to detect fetal heartbeat. It turned into a ""confirmation of pregnancy"" visit so they ordered the pregnancy panel, which included another hcg and progesterone. These labs were drawn at 3pm on the same day.

By Monday, I got all the results back. My progesterone at 11am was 16, it went up to 23 by 3pm. I've read articles about progesterone fluctuating throughout the day and I figured this was a chance to see it in action. What's funny is I requested to be prescribed progesterone after seeing the 16 and maybe it's not necessary, but it still gives me some peace of mind.",pregnant,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jb9qdz/2_progesterone_lab_results_from_same_day/
2025-03-14,1741960587.0,Kind of traumatizing doctors visit,"Is this normal?

I went in for my regular 4 week visit yesterday at 22w4d. This was only my second visit at this office, since I moved mid-pregnancy. The nurse took my blood pressure and it was slightly elevated. I let them know that I do get nervous for visits (on top of that they rush you into the back, have you pee, weigh you, then try to have a full conversation with you and then take your blood pressure). My first visit at the office, 4 weeks ago, my blood pressure was elevated the first time they took it, I think like 150/80. After sitting there for about a minute, they retook it and it dropped to 132/82. I told them my normal blood pressure, before pregnancy was about 120/80. Yesterday, the first time they took it my BP was 153/87 and then they retook it about a minute later and it was 147/83. I know these are elevated blood pressures, but I did not expect what happened next. The midwife comes into the room, we've never met her before and met with a different midwife 4 weeks ago. The first thing she says to us is ""we're sending you to triage"". My husband and I had no idea what she meant, this is our first pregnancy. I honestly thought she was joking because of how cut and dry she said it. She then told me that my BP is so concerning and saying all of these things to me that are instantly terrifying me. We have had a completely healthy pregnancy so far, with zero complications, so this came as such a shock. She was so harsh about the way she was saying things. We had previously expressed that we wanted a natural birth in their birthing center, she starts telling us that this is all at risk and that we need to make sacrifices and ""that's just how parenthood is"". We were completely shocked and scared with the way that she was talking. She didn't even ask us if we have any questions or anything, just told us the directions to OB triage at the hospital. When we got to the hospital they took my blood and had me pee in a cup and explained that they would take my blood pressure every 15 minutes for 2 hours. They wanted to check for early markers of preeclampsia. We met the triage midwife who was much nicer and well spoken. When the 2 hours was up, they prescribed me a low dose of labetalol. All of my blood tests came back negative for preeclampsia. I have no protein in my pee. The only thing going on is an elevated blood pressure. 

I guess I just want to hear from others if this is a normal thing to be sent to triage for or if it seems like an over reaction from the midwife? Also am I completely screwed from having a natural birth? Am I going to get preeclampsia no matter what?? I feel like I left with so many questions and overall just so nervous and scared. What would've been a 30 minute doctors office turned into us at the doctors/ hospital for over 3 hours. I was lucky to have the day off of work, but is this going to happen at all of my doctors visits?

Im terrified. Im so scared shes not growing enough and Ive done something wrong.

Some backstory, we are recent friends. Less than a year. We started hanging out because we have daughters around the same age and have similar interests.

She recently had her first failed round of IVF, that she said she was disappointed but not surprised by because she has had so many losses in the past.

My previous two pregnancies were both so textbook-like: nausea and super crazy exhaustion starting in 1st trimester, both symptoms pretty much gone near the end of 1st trimester. Not much craziness for symptoms besides that. Both pregnancies previously were boys (now 3 &amp; 5 years old). The only main difference is that with my first pregnancy, my morning sickness wore off each day around dinner time (what a blessing!), but with my second pregnancy, I was pretty much just nauseous 24/7. =.=¨

But this pregnancy?? This pregnancy... I'm sometimes tired, sometimes EXHAUSTED, sometimes nauseous, random times of day it comes and goes, also random pains and cramps at different parts of my abdomen (mostly on the right but occasionally on the left) that also come and go...just...!? And earlier on it was lots of bloating and constipation and gas and sometimes also heartburn and now I also get bursts of mom rage but really I just feel SO all over the place. =

People I've talked to are like ""oh, it's a girl"" = which maybe it is since my boy pregnancies were both so similar and predictable but this one is so all over the place and unpredictable so far. I know you can't really predict that, but I can't help but laugh at how many people have said that to me?! Like, what?? Haha.

Also my sister had fraternal twins during her 3rd pregnancy and I'm 34 and in my 3rd pregnancy so I can't help but wonder if I'm having twins?! I'll find out next week at my first checkup (just 6 more days!) but it's definitely been on my mind.

Not looking for predictions or anything, mostly just wondering there are any other mamas out there who have had similar situations, with crazy symptoms all over the place? Even if you haven't been pregnant before your current pregnancy. Maybe this can just be a safe place for us to rant about symptoms being so random, unpredictable, and all over the place. >à

2025-03-13,1741903662.0,I peed myself today. Twice. The second time was while on a work call.,"I started PT for incontinence over a month ago and have been making progress. I never had this problem with my first pregnancy, but luckily I work from home this time around so it's been easy to address issues when they come up. I'm 30 weeks and it's been going on since around 22+. Sneezing, laughing, suddenly standing from sitting at my desk for too long - nothing has been safe unless I've recently emptied. My husband has witnessed far too many instances of me sneezing or laughing, suddenly stopping all bodily movement, and waddling to the bathroom to change. We giggle every time, but damn has it been annoying. I make sure to pee every chance I get when we're out of the house. 

Cut to this morning. I took work off all of yesterday because I had to take our 2 yr old to the clinic for what turned out to be his first ear infection. None of us had slept more than 3 hours the night before and then I was running around trying to get him checked out and his prescription filled after hours waiting at the clinic to be seen. We also just got back from a family trip out of state last week which we all came back from with a bit of a cough. It all compounded and I woke up hacking, feeling so slow and weak, and just generally like s#!t. The cough is the worst part. So intense and painful when it comes on and I just have to ride it out while hoping I don't blackout from the effort of staying upright and not pissing myself. 

So I go to give my son his antibiotics before daycare and start a coughing fit that has me laid out on the living room carpet, red faced, wheezing, and despite my best efforts not to I peed myself. Quite a bit more than my usual sneeze slip, but not a full release. All the while my toddler is happily watching Octonauts and eating Cheerios, unfazed by his mother's demise happening inches from his chair at his little breakfast table. My husband is laughing at the admittedly hilarious scene while rubbing my back as I'm crying because I'm also laughing and have told him I just peed while also telling him to go f@&amp;k himself in between breaths. Only I get to laugh at me while I'm dying. At the end of this episode our son finally turns and asks ""Okay-k?"", his way of asking if I'm ok. (He does this whenever his dad or I cough, sneeze, trip, etc d). More tear-filled laughter as I collect myself from the floor and give him his medicine before the spell is broken and he refuses. I then go get changed and they go on their merry way to daycare and work. 

Later that morning I foolishly took a call instead of forwarding it to my coworker or waiting to hear the voicemail to see what needed doing. The woman of course has an involved issue that requires much back and forth and my voice is leaving me with every sentence, not to mention how many times I'm having to mute myself so I could cough without doing so in her ear. I finally get to a point where I need to loop in my coworker so she can take over. I stay on (muted) to hear out the situation and resolution. Just after it's over our supervisor checks in to see if she can help since she wasn't available to take the call originally. We loop her in for a catch up and I unmute. They of course know I'm pregnant and as I'm telling them about this morning my supervisor goes ""Oh no! And you're so far along! Was it hard to get up off the floor?"" I start laughing, which starts a rough coughing fit, and once again pee myself, this time so badly I need a shower. I stand there for a moment just staring at my leggings and the kitchen floor in bemusement and some disgust. I calmly unmute, simply answer I was able to get up with help, and excuse myself after their well-wishes and assurances that I do not need to take anymore calls today and to just forward them. 

I never thought my top reason to be thankful for WFH would be so I can piss myself without missing work. And yes, I did call my husband to catch him up on the fun he missed. If he brings me home adult diapers I honestly can't say if I will throw them at him or say thank you while flipping him off, but I wouldn't put it past him.

2025-03-14,1741911316.0,"Today I had the most inappropriate, violating, dismissive, condescending care ever by an MFM who has never met me before."," WARNING  If you are near Long Island, NY and you ever have a pregnancy in which you need a referral to an MFM for possible high-risk factors, DO NOT EVER go to Cecilia Avila, part of Stony Brook Medicine. Every other doctor in this practice is wonderful. I got the bad egg this time due to bad timing and luck. 

Today I received the most inappropriate and VIOLATING care Ive ever received by a doctor (keep in mind this includes the team and surgeons that *misdiagnosed my appendicitis and left my appendix in by accident*, rendering me infertile and needing IVF in the first place. I wish I had looked up her reviews beforehand. Theyre dreadful. 

Today I was supposed to see an MFM one more time as a formality to make sure I can continue under the Midwives care for the remaining 1-4 weeks of my pregnancy and deliver with them. Thats not what happened. 

Would rate negative stars if I could. She came into the room without ever greeting me or introducing herself. Without ever having met me or reviewing my chart, told me she refuses to allow me back into the SBU midwives care although I have *no high-risk factors* at 36 weeks other than my age (45) and this being an IVF pregnancy. (The baby is in perfect health and is growing on schedule. I am in perfect health, BP is fine, no GD.)

She then told me my plan to go to 40 weeks is basically killing my baby, although Id already been cleared by another MFM in the practice to do exactly that with close monitoring. The statistics for placental issues after 39 weeks for IVF/older patients are in 17/1000 births as opposed to 11/1000 births in other pregnancies. Thats still only 1.7% vs 1.1% - yes, its 42% higher than younger natural pregnancies but LOOK AT THE NUMBERS. 

She went on a rant, speaking poorly of all of these IVF patients lately who dont want induction or to go before 40 weeks and want care other than MFM. Her opinion on IVF patients desire for the least invasive options that can *safely* be done was vile and simply& wrong. Im not a monster for wanting to be under the care of midwives that are still connected to the hospital system, particularly when an OB or MFM on call at the hospital can take over at any time if medically necessary. 

The icing on the cake was when she did a RECTAL SWAB INSERTION for Group B Strep with no forewarning of what she was about to do. I understand this can be part of the process, but a decent doctor would tell the patient what she was about to do first. Had I done this at my midwife appointment, the swab wouldve been self-administered and ONLY vaginal. Not even a hello, and she was shoving a Q-tip up my ass. 

Ive never been treated like this by any medical professional  in 45 years of life. She was dismissive, haughty, condescending, rude, and violating. She does not belong seeing patients. She should be a desk doctor only, reviewing paperwork or in a lab somewhere. Her knowledge of IVF pregnancies is outdated and shes not up on the current peer-reviewed science. She bases opinions on old information and is not interested in hearing new statistics. Checking her reviews, she has told patients to TMFR without doing any actual diagnostic testing!

An MFM sees patients who are high-risk and already frightened and anxious about their pregnancies and their babies health. To treat these patients with anything other than kind, gentle, compassionate care is negligent at best, and dangerous and detrimental to both mental and physical health.

Im not a Karen. I have never reported a doctor in all of the years Ive been alive. Ive seen MANY doctors. This is the first time I have ever been treated like this. I am filing a formal complaint with Patient Advocacy as well as the home office. I plan to contact the Board as well. It seems Im not the first patient who has had this experience - but I want to make sure I am the last. No one should ever be told theyre killing their baby or have an invasive test without warning. 

I honestly have no idea who will be handling my pregnancy here on out, and its so jarring. I was almost at the finish line.

I want to preface this by saying I did have dental issue prior to my first pregnancy but it was manageable at the time. This is a direct result of my pregnancy. Anyways I had my second baby last year (2 under 2) and one of the most disheartening things has been my teeth. I have to get dental implants because my pregnancy cost me my bottom molars on both side. During my pregnancy I had HG which made me severely anemic, malnourished, and stressed. I would grind my teeth at night, threw up at any time especially early morning, and I couldnt stomach tooth paste. I couldnt take my prenatal either because even after trying 7 different brands I would vomit to the point of bleeding after taking them. Which means my babies took the calcium they needed from me. On top of everything I was so depressed that I barely cared once I noticed my teeth literally cracking (was speaking out pieces of teeth). With this combination my teeth were destroyed with the latest being pulled last month. I hate to smile now because my teeth have cracks, chips, and holes in most of my teeth. I lost my job during my first pregnancy so I have basic dental care through medicaid which doesnt cover the work I need. I love my babies dearly but I didnt know it would cost me my smile in so many ways. Emotionally and mentally I barely want to smile and now its a physical reason that my smile feels horrible. Please take your prenatals, please push your doctors to check your levels to insure youre not deficient anywhere, and do remember that pregnancy is harsh.

I'm worried my bf will hate me for saying that, but I've said since we met, I didn't want kids.  This pregnancy was not planned, and he's the ""God gave us this kid for a reason"" type of guy.  So, he probably would've left me had I went through with  the termination.  Of all the women out there PRAYING for a baby, why did it have to be ME that gets one??

My OB wanted to induce because while I do not have GD or diabetes, I do have a strong family history of diabetes and gained 6 pounds in between the 3 weeks of my last appointments. OB wanted to be safe rather than sorry and scheduled me for 39 weeks, which I agreed with.

My epidural never really worked the way it was supposed to and by the time my 26 hour labor (1 hour pushing) was over I could transfer myself to my own gurney. I also felt a lot of pain while pushing.

She did break my water before but the cervix check hurt more than that. We got the epidural placed and all was well. I started feeling my right leg though, as well as contractions on that side of my stomach, and had to tell a nurse three times before she got the anesthesiologist to come back and look at it.

I asked for an elective induction on my due date for my second pregnancy. I actually drove myself to the hospital and begged to be induced ha. They agreed (I guess labor and delivery was slow that day.) We tried a membrane sweep the week prior and nothing. I was just done being pregnant, I had a rough and painful (had to start leave from work a month earlier than expected because my hip pain was so bad I could barely walk) third trimester. Pregnancy was otherwise really healthy/ uncomplicated. Ive had one previous vaginal delivery (spontaneous labor at 39 weeks after membrane sweep). Relatively uncomplicated hospital birth (20hrs in labor, 30min pushing, second degree tear, normal recovery. I did have terrible back labor though but once I got the epidural I felt nothing).

My husband met me at the hospital and we had lunch and then walked over to L&amp;D. We got checked in and found out I was already 5cm dilated. Got started in pitocin and started having contractions. I BARELY felt the contractions though they felt like mild period cramps but could see them in the monitor. My husband and I happily hung out and watched tv for three hours (we joked it was the first date wed been on in months ha). 

After a few hours the contractions started to hurt a but more so I asked for an epidural. By the time i got the epidural they were pretty painful but i was able to breathe through it all. Epidural worked and dulled the pain a bit (not as strong as the one id had with my first delivery). Nurse checked my cervix (7cm now) and accidentally broke my water. 

I IMMEDIATELY felt the need to push/ excruciating pressure. She checked me again, lo and behold I was at 10cm. 

I pushed like 4 times and my healthy baby girl was born 8 minutes later. The midwife barely had time to get to the room. I didnt tear at all! They removed the epidural and I basically felt totally normal& 

Shockingly easy recovery, was out to lunch with friends a few days later& 

It felt like the epidural didnt work below my belly but honestly the pushing part was so fast it was fine. I also wonder if I didnt tear because I could feel everything& Anyways, I hope any future birth I may have goes exactly like this again.

2025-03-14,1741954896.0,Innocently annoying ass coworker,"Hello, FTM here. My mood swings were in full swing before I even knew i was preggy. They've been getting better in my 2nd trimester, however, I have a coworker who irritates theeee shiiiiit out of me. She's actually SO NICE, but she reeks of ""desperation""... I can't think of a different or better word... of wanting to ""fit in"" &amp; be a part of every conversation... its irritating.. we are at work, I'm inquiring about something work related &amp; she manages to squeeze in a comment regarding something outside of work.. just to say it... or just to have an interaction.. and the bosses have new rules now &amp; she sarcastically brings them up, OFTEN. Like okay, jokes old already &amp; I don't want to fake laugh, just bc i feel bad.. also, she was calling my baby ""peanie"" the entire first trimester.. just a horrid nickname..not cute..and in the sonogram, baby didn't even LOOK like a peanut.. if it did, call it peanut.. not peanie... bc wth is that? I asked her to stop. My aunt also called it peanut.. I literally asked, ""where does it look like a peanut?"" ... its annoying as shit.

Anyway, back to coworker (who I've known since hs.. we are in our mid 30s now)

Examples:
1. How's peanie? Idk...... good, I hope!
2. Go eat, you're eating for two now.... no, I'm not.. and I don't eat unless I feel hungry or it's been a while since I've eaten. Even so, just bc I feel a slight twinge of hunger, doesn't mean I have to go stuff my face.
3. When im walking away from my work station, ""don't forget to clock out &amp; not waste company time.. or you'll get fired"" (jokes old already! .) - ""don't forget to clock out before you use the bathroom"" - all sarcastic joking comments, and only she's laughing.. legit laughing.. and im like.. this isn't even funny to me.. enough already.. 
4. Talking about work related shit &amp; she wants to throw in, ""we need a girl day"" . . . Or some personal stressful detail about her life, COMPLETELY irrelevant from the work related shit im talking about.. not even a conversation starter, just legit one sentence. One comment. Just to say it.
5. Talking about food and how hungry she is ALL THE TIME and then comments about how good the food was or how bad it messed up her belly.. comments on it FOR HOURS throughout the workday.. I've turned into a ""that's crazy"" person.... &amp; a ""don't make eye contact"" person, otherwise, she's blurting out ""those empanadas were so good.. I want more"" ..... SO GET THEM! It's like why do you have to say something every single time i face your direction? Like idc!
6. I had a browning banana on my desk and she tells me, ""you better eat that before it goes bad.."" - I said i will if I want it, but if it goes bad, I'll toss it. I'm not afraid to throw food away if i need to.. I'm not a food hoarder and I don't eat every single moment I'm hungry or just bc food is in front of me. 
7. She thinks just bc I'm pregnant I'm supposed to be eating like a cow... I was telling her something about me and my bf eating and she inquires about my bf, ""he eats as much as you?""  - B%#$* !! first of all, I'm not heavy. I love my body, I think I'm pretty =% hot, &amp; I feel good about myself in a world where what we see online can make us feel like pure shit. Even if i was heavy, juicy,.... a voluptuous woman.. id still feel sexy. however, I do not look like I overeat.. at all. So that comment implies that just bc I'm expecting, I eat more than my 5""11 190lb weight lifting BF !? I can barely eat with all of my food aversions. I'm 5'3, always bloated in belly (prior to pregnancy) due to PCOS.. but to say that shit...  my blood boiled. The assumptions are crazy annoying. Just bc im pregnant, you're simply going to assume i cant control my food intake. Wth. 
8. She suffers from anxiety, I'm someone who worries here and there, has fears, like anyone else... especially as a FTM and possible complications etc. I was so nervous in the beginning of this pregnancy... and so she would make comments like, ""people like us"" or ""you know how our mind works"" ... associating me with an anxiety disorder. It's like she took my valid ass fears or worries.. and moments* of anxiety... to compare to HER &amp; associates with anxiety
9. Tells my worker (who trusts my pallet) that as long as she sits next to me, she's going to gain weight. (Again, not bc I'm heavy.. she just think bc I'm pregnant, I eat like a savage) mind you I have 2 meals a day bc so many food thoughts turn me off.) You're not about to blame me for my food recommendations*** &amp; if someone chooses to eat it.. and gains weight, ""blame her"" .. you're not cute or funny. Bc what you're saying isn't even true! If it were true, it wouldn't bother me.

All this shit IRKS me &amp; I can't control the annoyed feelings.

2025-03-14,1741964366.0,"Should I break up with MFM? (Labeled ""high risk"" because of IVF and 39, but textbook pregnancy so far)","Curious for this group's thoughts on MFM. In your experience, is it worth it, does it increase stress and costs unnecessarily, and does it push for interventions that aren't needed/scans that end up getting false positives? 

I'm labeled high risk at 39 as a FTM who conceived through IVF (unexplained, but very likely cervical issues). I agreed to MFM care in my first trimester because I was struggling with anxiety and happy for any additional assuring appointments. But at 22 weeks, anxiety is gone and everything is going perfectly with me and baby. I have a baby echocardiogram scheduled for 3 weeks from now, and apparently I'd start to see MFM every 2 weeks (!!) not long after that, in addition to all my OB appointments. 

I spoke with my normal GP today, who specializes in women's reproductive health, and she strongly recommended I consider bowing out of MFM care. This is given my zero indicated risk and the high likelihood that they would induce me (they told me they'd induce me before my due date) and overall push for scans and tests that often give false positives. 

She said MFM really pushes for babies to be born alive and early (pushing induction) vs. thinking about the baby's overall start in life (being able to nurse, breathe well, fight infection, etc). She sees the difference in newborn response and overall health whereas MFM and OB don't treat babies after birth, and the differences she sees between babies born 36-39 weeks vs. 40-41 weeks (especially for healthy women who eat, move, and have supportive communities) is huge. 

It's got me thinking! Anyone else avoid MFM or even extra OB intervention to avoid induction or being pressured toward induction (or just lots of expensive appointments/scans that aren't needed)?

2025-03-14,1741914680.0,Quitting Weed,"I believe smoking weed is NOT a risk worth taking while pregnant, Ive reviewed a ton of scientific literature and know it is not for me. 

Im not making excuses for myself but am wrecked with guilt about how difficult it was for me to quit weed altogether out of the fear of withdrawals. 

I found out at 5 weeks and immediately stopped smoking - HOWEVER, the absolute torture that is insomnia from weed withdrawals is one of my greater fears (from past quitting experiences) so I bought low concentration THC pills from a dispensary. 

From weeks 5-10 I tapered from 10mg pills to 2mg and stopped from there. My tolerance was so jacked up that 10mg did nothing for me so to be clear I have never been high while pregnant I was honest to god just terrified of the sleepless nights &amp; my ability to function at my full time job (where if you make mistakes its a very big deal). 

This pregnancy was so not planned and I feel so fucking guilty and concerned that I was selfish enough to not just suffer through however many sleepless nights I needed to to safeguard this babys development. 

It doesnt help that so many people tell me I know all kinds of women who smoked through their pregnancy and their kids turned out fine!!! They been said their doctors even recommended it&. Really doubt the latter and you dont know the impact on brain development right off the bat, you just dont know. 

Im not even a mom yet and I feel like Ive already screwed it up. Put myself as the priority right off the get-go and I cant take it back.

2025-03-13,1741899475.0,"Newly pregnant after TTC for a year, an ectopic, and diagnosed infertility","I guess I need somewhere to spill my news of excitement and anxiety. 

My husband and I decided to TTC last year this month and we got pregnant in July, only for it to end with an ectopic pregnancy rupturing and I lost my right fallopian tube. I was diagnosed with stage 3 endometriosis during this surgery (which I never knew I had) and it had eaten through my entire fallopian tube, causing the ectopic. It was covering my ovaries and all over my insides. After my ectopic, we continued TTC with times sex and using LH strips and BBT monitoring. 

After my ectopic, I started having really short luteal phases (7-8 days) several months in a row. After pushing my OBGYN, they finally decided to run CD21 progesterone labs and discovered that my progesterone was too low to confirm ovulation each month. They tested me three months in a row and confirmed I had stopped ovulating on my own. That combined with my stage 3 endo diagnosis, I was diagnosed with infertility. 

In January, they did an endometriosis excision surgery and found that my other tube was completely clear (yay!). They ran progesterone labs again the following month and I still was not ovulating. They decided to put me on Letrozole 5mg. 

I hit one year TTC this month and my husband and I took a trip to France. I didnt have my hopes high because Im so used to disappointment and seeing negatives, but the night I got home, on 10DPO, I got a positive. 

I immediately took a digital and it came back positive too. I cant believe my first cycle on 5mg Letrozole actually worked!! I am cautiously excited because the protocol following an ectopic is to get bloodwork every 48 hours until I can get a 6 week placement scan to ensure it is not ectopic again. I have started my bloodwork and my 6 week appointment is scheduled. 

I am terrified of losing this baby that we have tried for for so long. I am waiting for the other shoe to drop and I cant help but feel terrified that this baby wont make it, despite really healthy first bloodwork.

Im currently 9 weeks and 4 days pregnant with my first baby. After my first prenatal appointment, I received unexpected news from my employer that we need to return to the office after nearly three years of working remotely. I was devastated because I had hoped to work from home during my pregnancy and through my babys first year, but here we are.

I spoke with my doctor about it, and she gave me some great advice to make the transition easier, like treating myself to lunch nearby, listening to my favorite podcast on the commute, and finding small ways to make the experience more pleasant. That helped me mentally prepare, but Im still struggling with first-trimester fatigue, sleepiness, food aversions, and all the fun symptoms that come with early pregnancy. I have been told things get better in the second trimester, so Im hopeful.

Now, I have the option to work either:

* 5 days a week, 8 hours a day
* 4 days a week, 10 hours a day with 3-day weekends

I would love to hear from others who have worked a flex schedule while pregnant. For context, I'm a software developer. My commute would be 45 - 60 minutes. Would working four longer days be worth it for the extra day off, or would the longer shifts be too exhausting? I understand that everyone is different and experiences may vary. I'd still love to learn about others' experiences or any advice especially if you've been in this exact situation.

Im 57 and my comfortable weight when Im eating well and working out is around 135 (Im small framed and dont carry much muscle, so this is not too thin on me). The constant hormones and stress of IVF bumped me up to 145 prior to this pregnancy.

After I had on and off bleeding with clots occasionally until my 10th week of pregnancy. On my tenth week I had bleed out all of the hematoma (rushed to the ER scared again). The heart rate is now normal. 


My first OBGYN told me over the phone based on the picture I sent him of the bleeding I was miscarrying and there was no point of going to the ER as I already did a scan early due to spotting and it was not ectopic. He was wrong. Usually these hematomas have no symptoms or mild cramping and resemble a miscarriage. Please dont be scared and remember that it is not in your control or your fault. If you are diagnosed with one drink lots of water and take your vitamins.

2025-03-13,1741898316.0,Pregnant and Conflicted  Need Advice,"I found out about a week ago that Im pregnant (currently 4 weeks and 4 days). My boyfriend (22) and I (25) always said that if an ""oops"" happened, abortion would be the planbut we also acknowledged that you never truly know how youll feel until you're in that situation. And now, here we are.

I finish my nursing degree in December, have a steady job managing social media (which isnt hard to do and pays well), and were planning to move to Florida next summer. My boyfriend still has at least 3-4 years left of school (he's studying to be a chiropractor or physical therapist), and while he wants to be a dad one day, he admits now is not ideal. That said, he has made it clear that its ultimately my choice, since its my body.

I am pro-choice, but the thought of going through an abortion puts me in such a dark place mentally that I genuinely dont think I could survive it. Its not that I feel ""ready"" to be a mombecause who ever really is?but I just cant see myself going through the process of an abortion. His mom initially said its my decision, but she supports abortion and even called me to basically push for it. My boyfriend, while not pressuring me, also knows keeping the baby isnt what he would have chosen.

I know having a baby right now would make things a lot harder, especially with our move coming up. But I also know I *can* do it. My job is remote, and Ill still be able to work once we move. Plus, Ive always dreamed of being a momliterally forever. I want to be a pediatric or NiCU nurse, and once we move, I plan to find a job in either PEDS or NICU nursing while continuing to work remotely. Having a baby while finishing school wasnt part of the plan, but its not impossible.

Whats weighing on me is knowing that this wouldnt be his choice, and that his mom has already made it clear where she stands. He also told me that if we keep the baby, he probably wouldnt be able to work while studying, and he wants to be able to give the baby everything. I dont want to ruin his future, but I also feel like Id be ruining myself if I went through with an abortion.

Our relationship is so full of love, and the idea of ending this pregnancy when we are happy together *hurts*. It haunts me. I just dont know what to do.

2025-03-14,1741972548.0,Recommended induction for 9th percentile baby,"Hi everyone! I see a ton of posts about inductions being pushed for suspected large babies but not small, so I wanted to initiate the conversation and see if anyone has experience with this. I have had a totally normal healthy pregnancy so far, 31 years old pregnant with my first baby (a baby boy!) and underwent a routine 36 week US at my office (in retrospect I wish I declined this but you live and you learn) which showed that my baby's estimated fetal weight is 9th percentile, which is technically ""fetal growth restriction"". Of note he measured 24th percentile at prior ultrasound at 28 weeks. I have a repeat growth scan at 38 weeks 3 days and if he is still 9th percentile my OB is recommended induction between 38 to 39 weeks. I have had BPPs and dopplers to check blood flow which have all been totally normal, and I have a gut feeling that this is all seriously overkill. Also of note I was a small baby (6lb4oz at birth) and my husband and I are not big people (115lb pre pregnancy, husband is 150lb), and I have only gained 20-25 lbs during pregnancy. I am praying that he is 10th percentile or above at the growth scan so this is all a moot point, but if he does remain 9th percentile I am really inclined to decline induction if everything else remains stable as to not open the can of worms for cascade of intervention, but of course my first priority is baby's safety and would never want to put him at risk in doing so.

2025-03-14,1741912716.0,Pregnant to my ex,"So I found out I was pregnant about a week after my ex broke up with me.  I use the term ex very loosely as we had only been together about 3 months.
I told him I was pregnant and was keeping the baby, I have a decent paying job and expected to have a good support network around. It was his choice if he wanted to be involved. He said he would support my decision and be there for me. 

Fast forward to now Im currently 16 weeks pregnant, I have a few friends that are supportive (but have their own lives)and baby dad who was doing what he could until the past couple weeks. My family have said Im being selfish (very old fashioned and think Im crazy doing it alone) and havent been supportive at all. I have basically cut them out at this point. 

I was heavily relying on my ex for both emotional support but also just to make me feel less lonely. Its not been an easy pregnancy so far and Im high risk, Ive had to have him come over a few times at the advice of midwives. I know he has his own life to lead and hes said himself he cant be there 24/7 but does want to be involved, then backed off about 2/3 weeks ago. I have reached out but was brushed off, again it was a me problem, but if Im not healthy then baby isnt safe. He has been there when the midwives have advised me to take it easy and knows how high risk I am. I have been signed off work too. How much is too much to expect ?  Im really struggling both physically and mentally with the pregnancy. I also want to build a friendship with him so we can coparent to the best of our ability. I want to be comfortable around him for the birth but also afterwards. I dont think Ill want a practical stranger around me when Im in labour or even in the weeks/months following the birth. 
The fact he is aware that hes the only person I really have right now but is stepping away is also making me think will he do this to the baby.  Can I really trust him to be the best dad. I just want to build a friendship now, maybe initially I thought we could work on us but not now. 

For reference were late 30s early 40s he already has older children (young adults) this is my first but had previous miscarriages. I am financially stable enough to do it alone but just struggling with everything and him having stepped back Im feeling completely isolated. As I said I do have friends I can rely on but they have their own lives (jobs/kids/families etc)

Is it unreasonable to expect baby dad to be involved with me throughout the pregnancy?  Am I expecting too much to build a friendship or even expect him to support me right now?  I dont feel comfortable having him at the appts now or even asking for support when I had a scare. Baby seems to be ok its me thats not doing great. 

We got into a huge fight when I told him that I didnt want him to come along to my next appt and that from now on I was going to do it alone. I would just inform him of updates if there was issues.  That if he couldnt offer the support I needed then we would have to reassess his coming along and also the birth and beyond. I would honestly rather be alone than have him around right now. He just said theres no reason for us to be friends but he does want to know and be there for appts. He isnt getting my view that its my body and if I feel like he will be a stranger then it will be me who decides when he can visit and when he can attend the appts or hospital after birth. 

Maybe I was being too needy, maybe I was expecting too much.  But when I discovered I was pregnant I wasnt expecting to have this emotional turmoil, or to have such a high risk pregnancy. But I also feel he should have been clearer from the start about his boundaries. ",pregnant,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jargtm/pregnant_to_my_ex/

I'm literally crying my eyes out as I type this. I'm 39+6 today, I will be 40 weeks tomorrow. I have tried *everything* I can do get this baby out since 39 weeks. Now before I get lectured about being patient and letting the baby &amp; my body do what it needs to do, I want to say that unless you're in my situation, I don't want to hear that. 

I wanted to be induced at 40 weeks from the beginning as this as been a very difficult pregnancy and I *have* to work up until I give birth and I work as a housekeeper at a hospital, so I have a physically demanding job. I have accomodations and now I only clean one corridor during my shift but at this point, I'm so exhausted. Everything hurts. I have no stamina or energy anymore.

But at my last appointment with my OB, she didn't want to schedule an induction and wanted to discuss it later (this was at 37 weeks) I missed my 38 week appointment due to oversleeping and I missed my 39 week appointment which was yesterday due to the fact that I was having contractions and believed I was going into labor so I spent the time that should've been my appointment, at the hospital being evaluated for the contractions. The contractions stopped. So, it was false labor I guess. 

My next appointment is on the 19th but my doctor will be out of office and I'm meeting with her nurse instead. 

But I can't take this anymore. I just want relief. I'm sick of working while heavily pregnant. I just want to have my baby and start my leave. 

I'm going to try the miles circuit again tonight but if that doesn't work, I feel like my last resort is to go to L&amp;D and beg for them to induce me tomorrow at 40 weeks. I don't care about pitocin, emergency C-Sections, or anything else. I am literally losing my mind, I'm at my wit's end and I can't stop crying, I can't take this anymore

Ill get straight to the point, me and my gf are expecting our little girl in May and I could not be anymore excited to be a girl dad! She is currently 7 months so its getting closer. 

Tonight we had a bad argument. My gf has been sooooo clingy to the point its suffocating me. I dont understand and never will understand pregnancy, all I could do is research but Ill never understand what it feels like. I applause all you women who sacrifice your bodies for our children.

Shes been so clingy up the point where if I wanna go to the gym, take care of errands, or go with my family, she gets upset. I tell her to go with me but the days she doesnt feel like doing anything, she stays and complains. Ive been going to the gym and dropping weight and feeling better and I work pretty much everyday because Im trying to save up for a new house for all three of us. Its non stop with me, Im always working just to save money and grind for us. 

Tonight, she started ranting to me that Im never there for her or she feels alone. Ive heard it before and I step up and when she asks me to massage her feet, back, shoulders, etc I do it with no complaints. I always check on her when Im at work and always asks if she needs anything before I get home. She once again, said that she feels like Im not affectionate when all I do is care for her. She literally thanked me the other day and said she appreciates me everyday because Im so good to her but tonight I hit a boiling point..

I regret it and said some ugly things because she started saying ugly things to me and absolutely HATE yelling especially since our little girl can hear now. But I feel soooo unappreciated when she complains about me daily and when Im doing the best I can for her.. and for us.. we never really fight but its just built up and built up to the point where I got mad tonight. She left and went to go stay with her sister. Another thing i talked to her about was keeping our business private. The last fight we had she went and told her mom& like we have these arguments but I never go and run and tell my parents.. its so frustrating. I love her and thank her everyday for carrying our little girl but I feel like she doesnt see how HARD Im trying for us. I come home from work and I cuddle with her and spend time with her and its not good enough.. still saying Im not affectionate. She began crying saying that Im not affectionate and everything Im literally trying my best here.. but anything I do isnt good enough. 

I admit it, theres times Im exhausted from a 13-15 hour shift and im not as affectionate.. but Im tired. Then I still massage her with NO COMPLAINING. I just needed this little rant and we have our baby shower in a few weeks.. its not easy.. its our first baby.

Its been so frustrating for me to navigate high stress emotions during pregnancy. I've always been a sensitive and emotional person, but I had a good system of taking space, smoking a hot of weed and letting it chill my mind so I could process and work through my emotions. just having the control to be able to change how I was feeling in an instant was so helpful in breaking my emotional spiraling and allowing myself to regulate. now I feel frustrated because I don't know how to cope. I try breathing, I try walking, I even try screaming into a pillow, but nothing helps to reduce the feelings and I feel so helpless now. I also get frustrated because there are so many things I've had to give up while my partner doesn't have to and I can't help but feel childish and resentful that I have to give everything up and feel nauseous and exhausted and extra emotional and then I get frustrated with myself for feeling like that because that's not who I want to be. I feel so trapped and limited and I know it's temporary, but it's so so hard on those moments. 

so I'm wondering, if anyone else feels like this, how do they navigate it? I have worked so hard to be a good communicator and to be present and to work through my emotions, but they've just really been getting the best of me and I don't know how I'm going to get through this.

i decided to call my dr and went in and got testing done and my hcg was at 7,204 and they wanted me to come in asap for an ultrasound today, fast forward to the ultrasound we only could see the gestational and yolk sacs and i was told its probably because im so early but i cant stop thinking about how others have had no issues seeing baby even if it is tiny and why if my levels were so high that they wanted to do an ultrasound can we not see it? i have another ultrasound scheduled in two weeks but ive had some more cramping since all the testing began and the spotting has now gone from light pink to red, im trying not to freak myself out but i also have been feeling like all of my symptoms that i was feeling so strongly last week have gone away except for soreness in my boobs. is this normal? like i said this is my first and after being so convinced i wasnt going to be able to have kids i just cant get myself out of the rabbit hole ive created of overthinking.

For context, I was married for 8 years and we have 2 amazing kids(8 year old daughter, 4 year old son). The marriage had many issues including infidelity on his end and the divorce was not very amicable at first, but were co parenting fine for the most part now. I met my current partner 3 years ago a few months after my divorce, and weve been dating for 2 years. He is the most amazing and supportive man Ive ever met. He has only met my kids once at a family event a few months ago and he was introduced as a friend of the family. Now Im pregnant and am worried about how to tell them and how this new baby can affect them. They e had a lot of change in the past 3 years including moving twice, financial  issues (although I dont think they noticed that), not having a set schedule for whos watching then throughout the week etc. I was not in a great headspace for the first year after the divorce and unfortunately was drinking way too much and ended up getting a DUI (they are obviously unaware of this). We all began individual therapy kids included after the dui and It felt like our lives were finally in a stable, healthy, happy place. Everything felt calm and normal, now Im scared about how this pregnancy will affect them. Im almost at the 4 month mark and am starting to show, but I am really unsure of how to tell the kids without them feeling overwhelmed. My daughter in particular had a really rough time with the divorce and still struggles.

I plan on talking to my doctor tomorrow but I am struggling with my anxiety. 

I am currently 20w along with my second pregnancy. 

I first was great till the birth. Had him at 39+4 and he was semi big at 8lb 1oz. He also was sunny side up (nose facing my pelvis vs nose facing tail bone like normal) And for anyone that doesn't know that means that the widest part of the baby head is coming out first instead of the cone part of the head which is made to come out first. 

Him being born in that position caused me to tear in 3 locations all needing stitches and all VERY painful. I had the Epidural for my labor which also was a very long process for me as well but it only semi worked. i could feel contraction pain in my tail bone and my left butt cheek... they of course turned it off for the pushing part which lasted 2 1/2 hours for me. 

During my birth i was crying and saying i couldn't handle it anymore, i was in so much pain i wanted to quit. which i technically did as i stopped pushing myself though my body still naturally pushed and they had to help pull him out of me once his head came out. 

I feel as though I'm sort of traumatized and I'm having so much anxiety about giving birth again. I've told my husband that I am considering a C section as the cons of a c section sound way more worth it to me than going through a 24 hour labor, and 2+ plus hours of pushing and feeling like I'm giving up. 

I am aware a C section has a several month healing process, I'm aware of how the procedure works. What I maybe want is hearing other peoples experience. Did you choose to do a C section after a birth that scared you? what did you do to help with the anxiety of going through that pain again?

2025-03-14,1741941564.0,Abortion Is Okay Because Its Their Choice,"At the end of the day, abortion is a personal decision, and no one should be forced to stay pregnant against their will. Pregnancy is a major medical event that affects a persons body, health, future, and life in ways that only they can fully understand. No one else has to experience the physical pain, the risks, the emotional toll, or the lifelong consequences of giving birthso why should anyone else get to decide?

Some argue that a fetus has a right to life, but even if we grant that, no one has the right to use another persons body without consent. We dont force people to donate organs, even if it would save a life. If bodily autonomy applies to everyone else, why should it suddenly stop applying to pregnant people?

People get abortions for all kinds of reasonsfinancial instability, medical risks, being too young, not wanting to be a parent, or simply not wanting to be pregnant. And they shouldnt have to justify it. No one is obligated to give up their body for someone else, and pregnancy should be no exception.

If someone believes abortion is wrong, they dont have to get one.

2025-03-15,1742009542.0,#Saytheirnames: 18-year-old Alexis Lexi Arguello (USA 2025),"18-year-old Alexis Lexi Arguello had just moved into her own apartment and was preparing to start her adult life when Planned Parenthoods negligence killed her.

Shortly after moving out, Lexi suffered a urinary tract infection, went to get medical treatment and found out that she was pregnant. Likely not sure what her next steps should be, Lexi ended up the Fort Collins Planned Parenthood facility. She was told that she was 20 weeks pregnant. Although the facilitys website claimed that they only did abortions before 20 weeks, they scheduled Lexi for one anyway. 

During the abortion, Lexi suffered life-threatening side effects. It was obvious that she needed emergency medical treatment (which Planned Parenthood did not provide and was in no way equipped for), but the staff delayed in calling an ambulance and let her deteriorate. When they finally did call the ambulance, they tried to conceal the damage done by requesting that the ambulance not use sirens. 

This was not unusual for the facility. Witness reports from protesters and numerous dispatch records documented that the facility's frequent emergencies were  mishandled in a similar way. Life-threatening medical complications were downplayed, and time and time again Planned Parenthood tried to hide what they did to their clients. Ambulances were requested to come without sirens and were frequently directed by staff to use convoluted and indirect routes to make it less obvious that they had yet another emergency. They even had paramedics approach the back instead of using the more accessible main entrance. The ""silent siren treatment"" left Lexi suffering without help for even longer, delaying care and decreasing her chances at survival.

On February 6, the day of the abortion, Lexi's grandparents were told that she was in the emergency room. Her family hadn't even known she was pregnant, and now they arrived to find her in the hospital with doctors desperately struggling to keep her alive. She had lost so much blood that a transfusion of seven liters still didn't improve her condition, and the multiple doses of epinephrine were not enough to keep her heart beating. Her oxygen was too low and despite the best attempts of the ER, her grandparents had *seen in [Lexi's] face that it was her end.* Her blood pressure and heart rate dropped again, and she died the same day as her baby.

Lexi's devastated family wanted to find some semblance of justice for her and will take her killers to court with the help of Pro-Life organization Operation Rescue. A report of what happened to Lexi was also given to the  Colorado Committee of Health and Human Services at a hearing.

The hearing was about a bill that would require abortion facilities in Colorado to follow health and safety regulations in a similar way to medical clinics. Expert witness Dr. Keri Kasun gave testimony on what an unrestricted and unregulated Planned Parenthood had done. She confirmed that Planned Parenthood had delayed Lexis emergency treatment and stated that Lexi had been showing obvious symptoms of an amniotic fluid embolism. The risk of this complication is elevated for abortions later in pregnancy, and Lexi was even further along than she had been told at 22 weeks pregnant. (A premature baby born at this age could survive when given care.)

Amniotic fluid in the bloodstream would impair clotting abilities, making any injuries inflicted on Lexi much more dangerous. The further delays by not treating this as the emergency it was made everything worse.

In response to the bill and to the investigation of their egregious actions, the Public Affairs Manager for Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains (which oversees the oversees Fort Collins chain location) argued that they shouldnt be supervised or regulated and called the corporation a beacon of hope that would ""always fight for their patients"". But as Troy Newman from Operation Rescue put it, **This Planned Parenthood did not care if Lexi Arguello survived her complications. If they had, staff would have called an ambulance the minute she exhibited symptoms, and they would have requested lights, sirens, and any other measures that might have saved Lexis life.**

I assume most Christians here hold the view that God does not judge a non believing fetus the same as a fully grown non believing adult. No matter what for the fetus, he will send the fetus to heaven for eternity with him because the fetus doesn't have the capacity to have a belief in anything. So by this logic, abortion guarantees the soul of the fetus to spend eternity in the kingdom of heaven with God.... If you let the fetus grow up to be a human, statistically they have a large chance of Rejecting God and spending eternity in Hell.... Is it worth it to gamble on this? If you abort the fetus you ensure that soul is sent to heaven. It's the moral thing to do. Some of you might say ""thou shall not kill"", well even if it is, isn't this the ultimate sacrifice for ensuring eternal bliss of another soul in heaven? By this logic abortion is the absolute most moral thing you can do under the sun according to Christianity.

i think its quite safe to say that i am maybe still a bit traumatised from the experience. context: i had a surgical abortion at 3 months. i really wanted to keep the baby but was told not to. 

i know there are people out there dying from bombs everyday and im here, one year later, still thinking about the day i lost everything. 

not sure if ill ever get over this. i feel that if i do, ill be moving on from the one thing i loved most. but at the same time it crushes me every single time i think about it. i still look at my ultrasound scans. i carry them with me everyday because i cant bear to put them away. i hope things will be better.

2025-03-15,1742040148.0,I'm just on my 2nd dose of miso and the cramps have subsided already. But I'm not sure if it's successful.,"Hey, everyone.

I took my miso today at 2PM. After about an hour, the bleeding and cramps began. I passed several clots, and the cramps was also too painful. But, I am not sure if I already passed the fetus.

I am not 100% sure of how far along I am. My last period was last December 19. I took a PT by the end of January and it was negative. But, I experienced the symptoms and spotting around the 2nd week of February. I am aware that it is possible that the PT wasn't able to detect it yet in January because it's still early. And I only took 1 test that time.

So, if you count it based on my last menstruation, it would be around 11 weeks already. But, if I became pregnant in February, it's been only a few weeks. Therefore, it is possible that I won't recognize the fetus, right? =-

The cramps is not painful anymore, and I noticed that my breasts are not sore too. I will take my 3rd dose at 8:30PM. ",abortion,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jbtl8s/im_just_on_my_2nd_dose_of_miso_and_the_cramps/

2025-03-15,1742024357.0,My person is being distant after the abortion,"hi everyone, Im 23 (f) and hes a 27 (m). In the last post I expressed how I had an abortion with the person I was seeing. I am fully recovered physically but mentally and emotionally disoriented. My person was somewhat supportive throughout the process but not exactly how I wanted him to be. He was going out a lot and speaking with other females. Me and him arent fully in a relationship but I wouldve appreciated him investing his time into me during these times. Recently he has been doing things that have been getting on my nerves. He would always plan to see me but cancel on the very last minute. He did this a good 3 times. He would reach out to me and call me to hang out but once I get ready he would flake. I feel like he was doing it on purpose and I called him out on his behaviour and decided to delete him and move on because I dont deal with men like that. He would constantly message/call apologising and would make more plans. I would forgive him naturally because of the soft spot I had for him during the pregnancy. If it wasnt for that, I wouldve disappeared. Just recently Ive seen him partying through other peoples instagram/snapchat stories and I thought it would be funny blowing up his phone. He took this to heart and told me can you stop being so clingy, I came out of a 5 year relationship she was clingy and I dont like it. I fuck with you but stop. He called me clingy in the past to but I never too it as offensive. This hurt my feelings because he said it out of anger.  I was just doing it to be annoying and he took it for a complete different meaning. It wasnt the best idea. I think he thinks I want a relationship with him because of natural loving nature. I am affection and loving to people and love to give. My plan during our time together wasnt to fall in love. However, with the excessive love bombing, he would say things like im falling in love, or when you become my mrs he would talk about marriage a lot in the beginning. Kinda scared me because I know what he was trying to do. I wanted to keep things causal but since I got pregnant I grew an attachment with him as any woman wouldve. He makes me feel bad for it and when I try to express my emotions he shuts down. Theres been loads of times he has annoyed me but I forgave him and moved on. In this case, I deleted him from social media out of hurt and few days later I tried to message on iMessage and hes giving me the silent treatment. Bear in mind we were together a week before the argument, having sex. He hasnt blocked me from iMessage but when I try to request him he ignores the request. When I did this in the past he said you can stay there and learn your lesson. When I was pregnant with him. Im not sure exactly what to do now, I want to leave one last message before I fully move on as I feel like one day sooner or later. Hes going to try to reconnect and Im going to feel emotionally disoriented again. I want to take this time to heal and fully move on without being disturbed. 



This is the message I want to leave 

I have to say I find your actions really selfish. There have been so many times when youve annoyed me, and Ive brushed it off and forgiven you. I did something to annoy you once, it wasnt the best idea, but I did it. I apologised, and Im ready to move on from it. But youre still taking it personally and saying things unprovoked. I never once said I wanted anything serious with you apologies if I gave you the wrong impression, but Im just a loving person, whether Im close to someone or not. Whats really hard to understand is that youre getting angry because I felt attached. Any woman in my position would have felt that way. And to make me feel bad about it, especially after everything Ive been through physically, emotionally, and mentally, feels inconsiderate. I dont understand why this is such a sensitive topic for you when Ive gone through it. This isnt me trying to argue with you but choosing to communicate better. You can continue with the silent treatment if you want, but just know that you wont hear from me again. 

I found out I was pregnant beginning of this year and had my abortion a week after finding out. I felt so de attached and empty for the first week then went through a few week where I was so depressed, lost, regretful. Looking back I should have asked for help or spoken about my feeling more with my close ones. 

 Anyways, I thankfully managed to get back to normal weeks after and I kind of stopped thinking about my abortion and baby. Fast forward to now, for the past few days all I think about is my very short pregnancy, my baby and I now again feel a need to have a baby. I really thought I have recovered and moved on but maybe I havent? All I see now is babies and pregnant women. I cant stop thinking and day dreaming about pregnancy and being a mother. 

Has anyone got any advice? To clarify dates I had my abortion in January and my depressive stage lasted about 3 weeks. I was really hoping to be completely okay with it months after. I think I am scared that I could potentially go back to being in such a dark place. I look back and its super scary how unaware I was of how sad I truly was. Everyone around me would ask and try to help but I didnt accept it. I wouldnt clean, would just daydream 24/7, shower very little, not say much for weeks so it was very bad.

I had my ma on Monday, all was fine except I wasnt really bleeding into the pads, but everytime I went and sat on the toilet it came gushing out. Ive had mas before but always bled into the pads so this was a bit strange for me.
Tuesday-Wednesday I was fatigued, mild cramping and mild bleeding which was all to be expected.
Yesterday I felt pretty nauseous, cramping a bit more afternoon onwards and bleeding got a lot heavier in the evening time (7pm onwards).
Realised I had completely blanked taking my antibiotics on Tuesday so started the course last night.
Today I feel like Ive been run over by a truck. I feel so nauseous and sick, cramping above the waistline to the left side. Heavy bleeding has carried on but not enough to soak pads quickly. The blood has the usual after ma smell to it (coppery and slightly old smelling blood but nothing horrific). Im getting dizzy if Im standing up too quick, feeling hot (no temp), and just feel generally awful.
I know bleeding can get heavier on the 4th day, but Im just worried that forgetting the antibiotics for the 2.5 days has done some damage.
I also cant remember feeling this awful a few days post ma from past ones. 
Im just worried in case there is something or its normal and my anxiety is making me feel worse.
Its the weekend now so no gps or clinics will be open and it would just end up being the hospital I would need to go to (which I also dont want to go to since I work there and work closely to the emergency department so know some of the staff).",abortion,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jbjn7o/4_days_after_ma/

My boyfriend and I took a break, we were fighting A LOT, it was an almost three month break (up), and I stupidly got pregnant because the condom got stuck inside of me. Ive been trying to find funding for an abortion for weeks. I even went to a clinic that said they offered support which I misunderstood completely and I told them I didnt want to see anything. They end up doing an ultrasound, they had the audio on so I heard the heartbeat, and then they printed a photo for me to keep. They then at the end of the appointment told me they dont have the resources to help with abortion. Only prenatal, postpartum and adoption services. And then they kept me there for 30 mins telling me why I should follow through. So for two weeks it ate at me and ate at me.. but, I dont want to follow through. I want to get my own babies back first. They deserve so much better than what Ive given them in their lives. I called the national abortion fund and they told me as a head of household for one which Id technically be with me as a server making $2.33/hr and then $450/week I could not qualify for assistance.

I feel as if it will be traumatizing and it will make my mental health even worse than it already is and I do not want to relapse either because pain is a big trigger for me, so I would really like to just figure out how I can do it safely, with a professional, who can help manage my pain safely. I just cant justify keeping this baby with the factor of me being a year clean only; not having my kids, not having a car, like theres so many factors. I tried to keep this as short as possible.

2025-03-15,1742030442.0,We both want abortion but my wife can't get over the fears from her beliefs. How can i help her?,"Hi guys,

I seriously need your help on this, and this is a long one.

We just got married, and we f'd up. We know this is our mistake and we are blaming ourselves for letting this happen.

My wife and I just found out she's pregnant a few days ago, just a month after our wedding. The scan we did yesterday didn't even show the embryo inside the uterus, so we still have time to decide what to do. It's very early. It's too early even to do a MA. Now our initial reaction and up to even now after a few days is that we are not ready to have kids. We still want to enjoy our lives and no matter how we go through the scenarios in our head and together, we can not imagine and cannot accept the reality that there will be a children in our life, at least at this time. We fully believe having a kid will more likely leave us with more suffering, and unhappiness. We've talked to great lengths about this and agree that we will be most happy and content with just each other.

But my wife is a firm believer in Buddhist teachings, and she believes that we'd be committing a major sin, akin to murder and she seems to be unable to overcome this to get the courage to make the final decision. And i don't know how to help her get through this. I believe that the decision we want to make will lead to less sufferings, and better for all parties involved. But I fear that if we decide to have an abortion, she will also not be happy and will be in tremendous mental pain and I don't know if she will even be able to heal from it.

We are also super torn due to the fact that other than our own selfish needs and the vision that we have for our life together, there's no other reason to have this abortion. We are happily in love, both our families are well off, incredibly kind, helpful to us and will be over the moon if we reveal to them about the pregnancy. There's no real financial strain to speak of to take care of the baby if we let this happen. In our culture people believe that having children is a blessing, so there's no chance of talking to anyone else in our families about this, because we will face massive judgements that will make it impossible to even speak about an abortion, so that leaves us alone to work this out.

I've tried to convince my wife that this is not a crime, and we are making this decision believing it will be best for our life together, that what ever is inside her right now is not yet a living human being, and if we make this decision with kindness in our hearts, there is no need to fear of guilt, karma or anything like that. But she is dismissing me everytime I mention it and doesnt want or unable to let go of her strong beliefs. I can see that she's in the middle of a crossroads and cannot find a way out that she can accept. She's in great pain, and I'm feeling it too.

Whats bothering me a lot is that im cramping so bad and my stomach is very bloated since the last few days.

All of the symptoms I had during the pregnancy disappeared but now I just feel so disturbed because I have no period and have the same symptoms again. I have been wondering if anyone experienced this? I dont feel ready to go back to the doctor again as im traumatized from that place and I live in a country where its illegal.

2025-03-15,1742027301.0,Nervous! Question (and ramble) regarding GP,"So Im currently 7 weeks pregnant, if my workings out are correct.
Ive decided on an abortion as my partner and I just arent ready at this time - were looking for a bigger house as we are in a tiny house with no space for anything and we are trying to improve our quality of life.
I am an anxious person and I understand that having a baby is going to be stressful and an anxious time, and If we are going to do it at some point, I want to remove as much of that anxiety as possible. I feel having a bigger house and being in a space where we can do it at least removes some of that anxiety. I genuinely cannot see us with a baby in this space currently. 
I did come off the pill about a year ago as I didnt want to be on it anymore and at that point we sort of said just see what happens, but have been careful and used condoms where we could. Since then my anxiety/OCD has gotten worse and now its actually happened I just cant go through with it, for our sake and a childs sake.
I did go to my GP last week as I had some bleeding and cramps (which he said were normal) and the pregnancy was confirmed there and documented on my record.
I told him I was no longer on the pill and he asked me if I was keeping the pregnancy. I panicked and said yes as I was scared hed judge me when Id just said I came off the pill.
Now I have my consultation next week and Im worried that when the GP surgery finds out Ive had a termination that I will get in trouble.
I know you dont have to tell your doctor but as its on my record that Im pregnant, I dont want to turn up at a next appointment (whenever that may be) and they think Im still pregnant.
Any advice please?

For context I was 22 weeks on the dot and in California for the procedure. I also went to a planned parenthood.
I found out I was pregnant a month and a half before my abortion. I have super irregular periods, had no symptoms, no bump, nothing. When I found out I figured I was not far along and had an at home medical abortion that failed. I bled but my pregnancy test was never negative after that. I then decided to tell my boyfriend and my mom and booked an appointment at pp. My first appointment they ultrasound me and I was 21 weeks. I was in shock and soon after I started to feel him kick. They let me know it would be a two day procedure. I was terrified at first. I have extremely bad medical ptsd and am beyond terrified of doctors and needles. I did not sleep at all that week, but soon the fear of needles subsided and I was just sad. I spent a week feeling him kick. I felt like a mother and was so attached. I was two weeks away from the cut off in California and I made my choice for several reasons. Since I was unknowingly pregnant I was drinking for months and months while pregnant. I am also an avid vaper. On top of that I had the medical abortion. I could not live with myself if I brought a child into this world with chronic health issues, as that was what happened to me. I was put up for adoption and had chronic medical issues and hence the medical trauma. I felt I did not have enough time to check for health issues and I did not feel comfortable bringing a child into a world where I am not financially stable. I want to give my child the world and right now I was not capable of that. Me and my partner were adopted and know what the other side of that looks like so that could never be an option for us. I was overcome with grief but I knew what the right choice was, no matter how hard it was and still is. The first day of the procedure was the scariest for me. This was when they did the fetal injection to end the heart beat and did the dilation sticks. I was sick to my stomach over that shot, but I voiced that to my doctor and she could not have handled me better. She talked to me about my life the whole way through the procedure. The injection did not hurt, it was uncomfortable because I could feel how deep the needle was. The dilation sticks also did not hurt as she numbed me. The numbing shot was probably the most uncomfortable of them all but bearable. The next day I went in for the procedure and they knocked me out stone cold. I worked myself up for a lot of nothing.

2025-03-15,1742062747.0,Confused on logic and rights,"I recently did a deep dive and it left me confused. My issue is that I still don't have a genuine grasp on the logistics behind PL. I understand that PL views every fetus as a full-blown person with rights. However, rights come with the clause of not being able to take away someone else's rights no matter how small they seem in comparison. This should extend to the fetus if they are a full-blown human. That is where my logic leads me. Even if we take away the status of human with rights leaving them with just human life, the PP can still use their bodily autonomy to remove it. 


Furthermore, it's not the fetuses fighting against abortion it is born people. It's people with peens and uterus. By taking away one uterus owner's bodily autonomy you take away all bodily autonomy for current and future uterus owners. That is what having equal rights is about no matter how big or small the person is their rights are equal. If you give yourself the right to decide on someone else's behalf the same can be said in reverse. You cause a car accident and you're the perfect match for the person who got hurt you can and will be forced to save them. I understand being morally against something but you can't turn it into legislation that takes away rights from people currently alive and future generations. Jehovah's Witnesses don't believe in blood transfusions but they don't turn it into legislation because not everyone believes what they do and they would be taking away people's RTL. This is where my logic leads.  


In contrast, the PC logic seems streamlined to me. You have the right to bodily autonomy meaning you control what happens to or inside your body. If you end up pregnant and don't want to be you have the right to end that pregnancy. You end up pregnant and you want it congratulations hope you enjoy the journey. When applying the fetus has rights, not much changes. You end up pregnant and don't want to be, it's in your body and it can't take away your right to keep itself alive nor can any born person. You end up pregnant and you want it congrats on the pregnancy. It's beginning to feel more and more like your rights matter as long as there isn't a fetus involved.

2025-03-15,1742070086.0,"Do Women Have a Moral Duty to Keep Their Bodies ""Ready"" for Reproduction at All Times?","Late last year, Dr. Rebecca Gomperts (Aid Access, Women on Waves) announced results of a large clinical trial in Moldova, testing the use of a weekly low dose of mifepristone (50 mg) as a contraceptive. The results were promising, with only one pregnancy occurring within 2000 cycles. Furthermore, negative side effects were minimal, with only 4% of the participants experiencing any negative side effects (compared to a 40% negative side effect rate for conventional hormonal contraceptives). Additionally, the low-dose mifepristone was easier to use, requiring only one dose a week, and being more ""forgiving"" of variations in the time the pill is taken. And 89% of the study participants reported that they stopped menstruating while taking mifepristone as a contraceptive. (Probably most women would consider this a positive side effect.)

Because of the positive results, the trials have been expanded to the Netherlands this year. If the results continue to be positive, the plan is to apply to the European Medicines Agency for registration and market authorization to allow this weekly, low-dose mifepristone regimen as a contraceptive throughout the EU.

The method of action for mifepristone as birth control is two-fold: it reduces the rate of ovulation and it thins the endometrial lining of the uterus, making it impossible for a fertilized egg to implant.

([Source](https://msmagazine.com/2025/01/07/mifepristone-weekly-contraceptive-clinical-trials-abortion-pill-birth-control/).)

My primary question for PL supporters is this: 

* Would you have any moral or legal objections to women's use of such a contraceptive? If so, on what grounds?

Here are some secondary questions if you believe that the use of this contraceptive would be immoral:

* If a woman was taking mifepristone as described here *as a contraceptive* and informed her partner that she was doing this before they had sex, and if her partner, knowing this, decided to go ahead and have PIV sex with her, and if one of his sperm fertilized an egg but it failed to implant, whose would be the primary responsibility for the ""death"" of the fertilized egg? (Realistically, neither of them would ever know if this happened, so this is a hypothetical question.)
* *Men's* use of tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, red meat, and food high in trans fats during the months before their partners' conception is associated with higher miscarriage rates, because of these substances' impacts on sperm. ([Source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/a-mans-unhealthy-lifestyle-too-can-lead-to-his-partners-pregnancy-loss/articleshow/64072130.cms?from=mdr).)  If men engage in such unhealthy lifestyles, they are not maintaining their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction, and their choices could result in the ""death"" of a fertilized egg or even an embryo or fetus. Do they have a moral duty to maintain their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction by refraining from such lifestyle choices?",Abortiondebate,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jc47ep/do_women_have_a_moral_duty_to_keep_their_bodies/
2025-03-14,1741988561.0,"""Pretending"" to be PL, do I pass?","I almost wanted to make this post from an anonymous account to really make this a more authentic thought experiment but felt like that would be a pushing if not trampling sub rules so doing it like this instead. I'm tagging it as ""question for PL"" as its mostly aimed there, but there are a couple things for PC as well.

**What I want to do:** 

I will present a stance and arguments as if I am PL. I will do so to the best of my ability, providing multiple of the most reasonable arguments I know of. I won't go ham on ALL details, but enough as to get the gist of the reasons behind my pretend stance. It will still be in my own ""voice"" as a debatee though, and will not use arguments that I find completely bogus (religious, consent to sex is consent to pregnancy, appeal to nature, etc). So don't hold that against me. After I will ask a few questions. Keep in mind that that the idea of the post is not necessarily in the arguments I'm presenting themselves but more in my (and by extension other PC with similar view points) ability to understand the PL view. So here goes:

**The argument:**

During fertilization, a unique entity with human DNA is created. The exact point as to when this entity should legally become a person is hard to pin point as it can change due to technology and is subject to a lot of semantic and philosophical ideas regarding personhood and law. So, my go to is to err on the side of caution and say that it should be treated as a legal person from the moment its existence is known, i.e. fertilization. This seems as the more morally sensible choice as it is better to err on the side of giving the entity more rights, that of a legal person, rather than less and risk being in the moral wrong later.

From there, since we are talking about a person with the same rights as others. This includes the right to life, which should ensure that a person is not deprived of their life, or any other right, for that matter without due process. When abortions are legal, a female person is able for any reason kill the fetus, and thus taking away their right to life without due process. Although we allow killing in self defense, even after the incident is done there would be an investigation to determine if the lethal measure was justified. This happens whenever any person is killed. Without banning abortion, this investigation would never happen, and since I think there are times in which an abortion is an unjustified use of lethal force, it should in fact occur.

So, abortion should be banned with exceptions so that it is only used in certain cases where lethal force is justified. Specifically, when there is a particular medical reason that can be named by a doctor for having the abortion outside of that from ""normal pregnancy symptoms"". This is also in part because the fetus it self has done nothing wrong, as it is incapable of having intent and acting on it. As such, it would be a moral and legal wrong for them to be killed when they have not committed a crime. Although having the female person carry the pregnancy to term may have adverse affects for them, it is a greater wrong for the law to allow a person to be killed when they could have otherwise lived.

Although forcing female people to gestate against their will may be unfortunate as a side effect, the law should err on the side of keeping persons alive in this case. Especially since unlike organ donation they are forcing inaction, rather than forcing a procedure. The female could be compensated and their struggles alleviated, weather they be social, financial or otherwise, using other government programs instead of allowing them to kill the person causing them.

It is not ideal, but it is the better status quo than persons being killed for unjustifiable reasons without due process. As a society, we should strive for the over all well being of everybody, and killing a person who has done nothing wrong goes against that. Everybody deserves a chance at life unless there are severe extenuating circumstances and in vast majority of cases, a pregnancy by it self does not constitute those.

**The questions, geared toward PL:**

1. If you are PL, if you read this without knowing I am PC, would you believe I am PL? As in, do you believe I represented  your views and arguments, or at least ones close to your stance justifiably? If no, what did I miss or what gives me away?

2. If you answered yes to 1, then lets go back to the fact that I AM vehemently, no restrictions PC. Considering I, supposedly, understand and know your arguments enough to present them in a way you find acceptable, why do you think that is?

3. Are you in response, regardless of how ""accurate"" you think my ""post"" is able to provide a counter argument as if you are PC? If you do so, do you feel like you would be able to ""pass"" as a PC? Feel free to attempt to do so as answer to this question as well.

**More questions, geared towards PC:**

1. Do you think I ""pass"" as PL? If not could you do better and where?

2. If a PL person demonstrated the same amount of understanding of the PC stance as I have demonstrated about PL, why do you think they are still PL? (This is meant to be a mirror of question 2 for the PL, sorry for the weird wording)

**Both can answer:**

If you were to guess, who do you think would do better at this ""pretend to be the other side"" exercise, PL or PC?

2025-03-14,1741991016.0,"My husband wants more kids, are my conditions unreasonable?","When I met my husband I was a fence sitter. Over time I warmed up the idea and decided Id be okay with one baby. Husband wanted three, but was glad I was open to one. We got married and after a year of trying I got pregnant with my little girl who is due in June.

Now tell me why this man is watching me suffer and is already talking about a second baby??
We had discussed right before I got pregnant that I MIGHT do two, but we dont know what pregnancy and parenthood will be like and Im not rushing to make that decision before we see what life is like with a baby.

He keeps saying the baby needs a sibling and he really wants a boy and a girl. I thought on it and decided under certain conditions I could be open to one more, definitely not three.

My conditions: 
1. We must be comfortable with the political and economical climate at the time specifically in regard to womens rights and maternal rights.

2. After breast feeding husband pays for a breast lift and tummy tuck if needed.

3. He must be okay with stopping at 2 even if we have another daughter. By stopping at 2 I mean he will get a vasectomy.

Husband is willing to accept 1-2 and says even if its another girl hed gladly stop at 2 babies so she can have a sibling. 

However, he says he will not get a vasectomy. I explained in detail how its reversible and much safer than me getting my tubes tied. He insists we can continue to use condoms and plan B as needed. I told him currently in the USA they are working to ban birth control, abortion, and plan b and we will have no fall back if I get pregnant at 40 which we both agree we wouldnt want another kid at that age.

Is this unreasonable? He says he doesnt want to mess with his downstairs and I rolled my eyes and reminded him what Im doing to my body for us to have a child.

My husband has been kind and taken good care of me through this, but I feel Ive compromised a lot and met him half way on our ideals with what our family will be like. Is a vasectomy really asking too much??

Edit: Id like to point out as there seems to be some confusion. Id never force my husband to have a vasectomy. Its simply a condition if he wants a second child which is something he wants.

I recently found out I was pregnant. I am almost 11 weeks along. He has one child of his own, and that child is a handful. The mother is not involved and he has no family to help him.. lately all its been is him smoking weed all day and just laying on the couch. I have been extremely depressed and have no motivation for anything and I have been very sick. When I first told him I was pregnant (this was a surprise as I was on birth control), he right off the bat told me to get an abortion.. which is upsetting because he always used to tell me he doesnt believe in it.  Until eventually he changed his mind when he brought up he can go work somewhere far when the baby is born to make money. Which seems odd.. but oh well. Anyways.. skip to today, I can not be with this man. His child is a handful, all four of mine are easier to handle for a full day than his kid in an hour. Everytime he even tries to cuddle me or be close shes climbing on him and giving no personal space. So I told him to move out. At this point I feel like he is using me for a place to stay.. he only pays half of rent, and I pay the other half and all utitlies and all of groceries.

2025-03-15,1742022263.0,CMV: Men are not obliged to empathize with women,"There has been a growing trend on Reddit blaming men for the recent election results, particularly those who voted Republican, third-party, or didnt vote at all. This criticism seems to stem from the assumption that men are obligated to vote in favor of women's interests, even when those interests may conflict with their own. It reflects a broader societal expectation that men should always prioritize empathy for women, often at the expense of their own well-being.

Consider these examples:

* A **homeless man** is expected to care more about abortion rights than policies that might improve his economic situationeven though abortion is largely avoidable through contraception, and cases of rape/incest account for less than 1% of abortions.
* A **divorced father with limited custody** is supposed to support policies that subsidize single mothers rather than advocating for equal custody rights.
* A **male victim of domestic violence** is often ignored due to legal frameworks like the Duluth Model, which assumes men are the primary aggressors. If he reports abuse, he risks being arrested or removed from his home instead.
* A **man falsely accused of a crime** is expected to accept the risk of wrongful imprisonment because prioritizing ""believing victims"" is seen as more important than his reputation and livelihood. For example, in India, men can be jailed for four days based solely on an allegation, regardless of evidence.
* A **single, lonely man** is expected to vote for parties that fund social programs benefiting nearly every demographic except young men, despite the ongoing male loneliness crisis.

At the same time, men who express the need for empathy or support are often dismissed as weak, entitled, or having a ""fragile ego."" This expectation of one-sided altruism is rarely reciprocated. For instance:

* When India proposed **gender-neutral rape laws**, feminist groups opposed them, arguing they could be used against female victims.
* **Erin Pizzey**, a pioneer in domestic violence shelters, was ostracized and received bomb threats after advocating for shelters for male victims.
* **Floridas National Organization for Women** actively opposed a shared custody bill, showing little concern for fathers' rights.
* **Earl Silverman**, who tried to establish a shelter for male domestic violence victims, was ridiculed and struggled to secure funding. He later died by suicide.
* During **World War I**, women publicly shamed men who didnt enlist, handing out white feathers to label them cowards, yet men were still expected to defend and protect society.

Given this pattern, I believe men should prioritize their own interests and direct their empathy toward those who will genuinely reciprocate it. The expectation that men should always sacrifice for women, without similar consideration in return, is unfair and outdated.

I am open to changing my view if presented with compelling proof that men, as a group, receive equal reciprocity in terms of empathy and policy considerations by the folks we are supposed to empathize with. If there are examples of significant legal or societal movements advocating for mens issues with the same degree as womens rights/privileges, I would reconsider my stance.

Edit:  
Some other examples of gender biased laws which affect men are affirmative action, Duluth model, family courts favoring women statistically, paternity fraud not being a crime, paternity tests being illegal in France, South Koreas women protesting to have men's military service compensation removed, India's entire list of gender biased laws etc.

Edit 2:  
Since nobody came up with any example, I myself came up with the example of Iranian men being obliged to have empathy for Iranian women given they have lesser rights in their country. Iranian women never protested for any rights of their men to be stolen. Iranian women are unfortunately not legally free, though culturally have sufficient rights as society doesnt support the theocracy. If I get a similar situation in US/UK or any country where women are completely free legally and culturally and have fought for men's rights to be restored or certain policies to be removed, I'll change my view.

2025-03-15,1742009542.0,#Saytheirnames: 18-year-old Alexis Lexi Arguello (USA 2025),"18-year-old Alexis Lexi Arguello had just moved into her own apartment and was preparing to start her adult life when Planned Parenthoods negligence killed her.

Shortly after moving out, Lexi suffered a urinary tract infection, went to get medical treatment and found out that she was pregnant. Likely not sure what her next steps should be, Lexi ended up the Fort Collins Planned Parenthood facility. She was told that she was 20 weeks pregnant. Although the facilitys website claimed that they only did abortions before 20 weeks, they scheduled Lexi for one anyway. 

During the abortion, Lexi suffered life-threatening side effects. It was obvious that she needed emergency medical treatment (which Planned Parenthood did not provide and was in no way equipped for), but the staff delayed in calling an ambulance and let her deteriorate. When they finally did call the ambulance, they tried to conceal the damage done by requesting that the ambulance not use sirens. 

This was not unusual for the facility. Witness reports from protesters and numerous dispatch records documented that the facility's frequent emergencies were  mishandled in a similar way. Life-threatening medical complications were downplayed, and time and time again Planned Parenthood tried to hide what they did to their clients. Ambulances were requested to come without sirens and were frequently directed by staff to use convoluted and indirect routes to make it less obvious that they had yet another emergency. They even had paramedics approach the back instead of using the more accessible main entrance. The ""silent siren treatment"" left Lexi suffering without help for even longer, delaying care and decreasing her chances at survival.

On February 6, the day of the abortion, Lexi's grandparents were told that she was in the emergency room. Her family hadn't even known she was pregnant, and now they arrived to find her in the hospital with doctors desperately struggling to keep her alive. She had lost so much blood that a transfusion of seven liters still didn't improve her condition, and the multiple doses of epinephrine were not enough to keep her heart beating. Her oxygen was too low and despite the best attempts of the ER, her grandparents had *seen in [Lexi's] face that it was her end.* Her blood pressure and heart rate dropped again, and she died the same day as her baby.

Lexi's devastated family wanted to find some semblance of justice for her and will take her killers to court with the help of Pro-Life organization Operation Rescue. A report of what happened to Lexi was also given to the  Colorado Committee of Health and Human Services at a hearing.

The hearing was about a bill that would require abortion facilities in Colorado to follow health and safety regulations in a similar way to medical clinics. Expert witness Dr. Keri Kasun gave testimony on what an unrestricted and unregulated Planned Parenthood had done. She confirmed that Planned Parenthood had delayed Lexis emergency treatment and stated that Lexi had been showing obvious symptoms of an amniotic fluid embolism. The risk of this complication is elevated for abortions later in pregnancy, and Lexi was even further along than she had been told at 22 weeks pregnant. (A premature baby born at this age could survive when given care.)

Amniotic fluid in the bloodstream would impair clotting abilities, making any injuries inflicted on Lexi much more dangerous. The further delays by not treating this as the emergency it was made everything worse.

In response to the bill and to the investigation of their egregious actions, the Public Affairs Manager for Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains (which oversees the oversees Fort Collins chain location) argued that they shouldnt be supervised or regulated and called the corporation a beacon of hope that would ""always fight for their patients"". But as Troy Newman from Operation Rescue put it, **This Planned Parenthood did not care if Lexi Arguello survived her complications. If they had, staff would have called an ambulance the minute she exhibited symptoms, and they would have requested lights, sirens, and any other measures that might have saved Lexis life.**

2025-03-15,1742015399.0,"As one's faith grows...do certain fictional stories/genres feel inherently more ""Anti-Christian""","As I journey towards my Baptism into the Catholic faith I'm re-evaluating many things in my life. One of them is obviously the media I consume. ""Custody of the eyes"" is easy and obvious when talking about content that is incredibly explicit or gratuitous in nature. It's best not to view it is a pretty easy conclusion to come to.

I find that when dealing with pure fantasy(Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Dragon Ball) of ""elseworlds"" so to speak...that entirely different world with an entirely different set of rules often ""Works"" for my rationalizing mind. A story about Samurai hunting monstrous demons hundreds of years ago, that clicks. Fantasy.

But surprisingly, I'm finding the sci-fi genre to have an inherently atheistic/Non-Christian view about most things. It is always so much about discovering alien life, or alien life being a given reality, presented in ways that feel like they sort of fly in the face of the Christian worldview and our understanding of Biblical history.

Meaning in the sense that they are often very pro Evolution, anti-God/Faith in lieu of putting ""science"" first, and even sometimes want to be filled with ""alternative explanations"" for the origins of life, creation, or deal with God-like beings that supplant the notion of ""God"" in our world and timeline.

I understand all movies are fictional ""what if"" scenarios...but I'm beginning to have annoyed moments when it comes to how some of these things get portrayed or addressed.

I'm not one to be overly prickly when it comes to things like this, but sometimes it just doesn't sit well with me in the genre of heavy sci-fi films, mentally reconciling what's being portrayed, stated, and implied on screen with the Biblical timeline or other Biblical truths of our world.

It ends up pushing my interest either completely into fantasy fiction like the aforementioned Dragon Ball or LOTR...or it makes me have a preference for more plausible, ""real world"" set action films like Mission Impossible and others like it.

I assume most Christians here hold the view that God does not judge a non believing fetus the same as a fully grown non believing adult.

So by this logic, abortion guarantees the soul of the fetus to spend eternity in the kingdom of heaven with God.... If you let the fetus grow up to be a human, statistically they have a large chance of Rejecting God and spending eternity in Hell.... Is it worth it to gamble on this? If you abort the fetus you ensure that soul is sent to heaven. It's the moral thing to do. Some of you might say ""thou shall not kill"", well even if it is, isn't this the ultimate sacrifice for ensuring eternal bliss of another soul in heaven?

I took my miso today at 2PM. After about an hour, the bleeding and cramps began. I passed several clots, and the cramps was also too painful. But, I am not sure if I already passed the fetus.

I am not 100% sure of how far along I am. My last period was last December 19. I took a PT by the end of January and it was negative. But, I experienced the symptoms and spotting around the 2nd week of February. I am aware that it is possible that the PT wasn't able to detect it yet in January because it's still early. And I only took 1 test that time.

So, if you count it based on my last menstruation, it would be around 11 weeks already. But, if I became pregnant in February, it's been only a few weeks. Therefore, it is possible that I won't recognize the fetus, right? =-

2025-03-15,1742062747.0,Confused on logic and rights,"I recently did a deep dive and it left me confused. My issue is that I still don't have a genuine grasp on the logistics behind PL. I understand that PL views every fetus as a full-blown person with rights. However, rights come with the clause of not being able to take away someone else's rights no matter how small they seem in comparison. This should extend to the fetus if they are a full-blown human. That is where my logic leads me. Even if we take away the status of human with rights leaving them with just human life, the PP can still use their bodily autonomy to remove it. 


Furthermore, it's not the fetuses fighting against abortion it is born people. It's people with peens and uterus. By taking away one uterus owner's bodily autonomy you take away all bodily autonomy for current and future uterus owners. That is what having equal rights is about no matter how big or small the person is their rights are equal. If you give yourself the right to decide on someone else's behalf the same can be said in reverse. You cause a car accident and you're the perfect match for the person who got hurt you can and will be forced to save them. I understand being morally against something but you can't turn it into legislation that takes away rights from people currently alive and future generations. Jehovah's Witnesses don't believe in blood transfusions but they don't turn it into legislation because not everyone believes what they do and they would be taking away people's RTL. This is where my logic leads.  


In contrast, the PC logic seems streamlined to me. You have the right to bodily autonomy meaning you control what happens to or inside your body. If you end up pregnant and don't want to be you have the right to end that pregnancy. You end up pregnant and you want it congratulations hope you enjoy the journey. When applying the fetus has rights, not much changes. You end up pregnant and don't want to be, it's in your body and it can't take away your right to keep itself alive nor can any born person. You end up pregnant and you want it congrats on the pregnancy. It's beginning to feel more and more like your rights matter as long as there isn't a fetus involved. What is the logic that leads PL to where it is?",Abortiondebate,31.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jc1gmi/confused_on_logic_and_rights/
2025-03-14,1741988561.0,"""Pretending"" to be PL, do I pass?","I almost wanted to make this post from an anonymous account to really make this a more authentic thought experiment but felt like that would be a pushing if not trampling sub rules so doing it like this instead. I'm tagging it as ""question for PL"" as its mostly aimed there, but there are a couple things for PC as well.

**What I want to do:** 

I will present a stance and arguments as if I am PL. I will do so to the best of my ability, providing multiple of the most reasonable arguments I know of. I won't go ham on ALL details, but enough as to get the gist of the reasons behind my pretend stance. It will still be in my own ""voice"" as a debatee though, and will not use arguments that I find completely bogus (religious, consent to sex is consent to pregnancy, appeal to nature, etc). So don't hold that against me. After I will ask a few questions. Keep in mind that that the idea of the post is not necessarily in the arguments I'm presenting themselves but more in my (and by extension other PC with similar view points) ability to understand the PL view. So here goes:

**The argument:**

During fertilization, a unique entity with human DNA is created. The exact point as to when this entity should legally become a person is hard to pin point as it can change due to technology and is subject to a lot of semantic and philosophical ideas regarding personhood and law. So, my go to is to err on the side of caution and say that it should be treated as a legal person from the moment its existence is known, i.e. fertilization. This seems as the more morally sensible choice as it is better to err on the side of giving the entity more rights, that of a legal person, rather than less and risk being in the moral wrong later.

From there, since we are talking about a person with the same rights as others. This includes the right to life, which should ensure that a person is not deprived of their life, or any other right, for that matter without due process. When abortions are legal, a female person is able for any reason kill the fetus, and thus taking away their right to life without due process. Although we allow killing in self defense, even after the incident is done there would be an investigation to determine if the lethal measure was justified. This happens whenever any person is killed. Without banning abortion, this investigation would never happen, and since I think there are times in which an abortion is an unjustified use of lethal force, it should in fact occur.

So, abortion should be banned with exceptions so that it is only used in certain cases where lethal force is justified. Specifically, when there is a particular medical reason that can be named by a doctor for having the abortion outside of that from ""normal pregnancy symptoms"". This is also in part because the fetus it self has done nothing wrong, as it is incapable of having intent and acting on it. As such, it would be a moral and legal wrong for them to be killed when they have not committed a crime. Although having the female person carry the pregnancy to term may have adverse affects for them, it is a greater wrong for the law to allow a person to be killed when they could have otherwise lived.

Although forcing female people to gestate against their will may be unfortunate as a side effect, the law should err on the side of keeping persons alive in this case. Especially since unlike organ donation they are forcing inaction, rather than forcing a procedure. The female could be compensated and their struggles alleviated, weather they be social, financial or otherwise, using other government programs instead of allowing them to kill the person causing them.

It is not ideal, but it is the better status quo than persons being killed for unjustifiable reasons without due process. As a society, we should strive for the over all well being of everybody, and killing a person who has done nothing wrong goes against that. Everybody deserves a chance at life unless there are severe extenuating circumstances and in vast majority of cases, a pregnancy by it self does not constitute those.

**The questions, geared toward PL:**

1. If you are PL, if you read this without knowing I am PC, would you believe I am PL? As in, do you believe I represented  your views and arguments, or at least ones close to your stance justifiably? If no, what did I miss or what gives me away?

2. If you answered yes to 1, then lets go back to the fact that I AM vehemently, no restrictions PC. Considering I, supposedly, understand and know your arguments enough to present them in a way you find acceptable, why do you think that is?

3. Are you in response, regardless of how ""accurate"" you think my ""post"" is able to provide a counter argument as if you are PC? If you do so, do you feel like you would be able to ""pass"" as a PC? Feel free to attempt to do so as answer to this question as well.

**More questions, geared towards PC:**

1. Do you think I ""pass"" as PL? If not could you do better and where?

2. If a PL person demonstrated the same amount of understanding of the PC stance as I have demonstrated about PL, why do you think they are still PL? (This is meant to be a mirror of question 2 for the PL, sorry for the weird wording)

**Both can answer:**

If you were to guess, who do you think would do better at this ""pretend to be the other side"" exercise, PL or PC? And I don't mean by completely lying and using arguments one completely doesn't see the reasoning behind or imitating some voice or other but genuinely trying to make the argument for the other side like a devils advocate?",Abortiondebate,28.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jbf6um/pretending_to_be_pl_do_i_pass/

2025-03-15,1742009542.0,#Saytheirnames: 18-year-old Alexis Lexi Arguello (USA 2025),"18-year-old Alexis Lexi Arguello had just moved into her own apartment and was preparing to start her adult life when Planned Parenthoods negligence killed her.

Shortly after moving out, Lexi suffered a urinary tract infection, went to get medical treatment and found out that she was pregnant. Likely not sure what her next steps should be, Lexi ended up the Fort Collins Planned Parenthood facility. She was told that she was 20 weeks pregnant. Although the facilitys website claimed that they only did abortions before 20 weeks, they scheduled Lexi for one anyway. 

During the abortion, Lexi suffered life-threatening side effects. It was obvious that she needed emergency medical treatment (which Planned Parenthood did not provide and was in no way equipped for), but the staff delayed in calling an ambulance and let her deteriorate. When they finally did call the ambulance, they tried to conceal the damage done by requesting that the ambulance not use sirens. 

This was not unusual for the facility. Witness reports from protesters and numerous dispatch records documented that the facility's frequent emergencies were  mishandled in a similar way. Life-threatening medical complications were downplayed, and time and time again Planned Parenthood tried to hide what they did to their clients. Ambulances were requested to come without sirens and were frequently directed by staff to use convoluted and indirect routes to make it less obvious that they had yet another emergency. They even had paramedics approach the back instead of using the more accessible main entrance. The ""silent siren treatment"" left Lexi suffering without help for even longer, delaying care and decreasing her chances at survival.

On February 6, the day of the abortion, Lexi's grandparents were told that she was in the emergency room. Her family hadn't even known she was pregnant, and now they arrived to find her in the hospital with doctors desperately struggling to keep her alive. She had lost so much blood that a transfusion of seven liters still didn't improve her condition, and the multiple doses of epinephrine were not enough to keep her heart beating. Her oxygen was too low and despite the best attempts of the ER, her grandparents had *seen in [Lexi's] face that it was her end.* Her blood pressure and heart rate dropped again, and she died the same day as her baby.

Lexi's devastated family wanted to find some semblance of justice for her and will take her killers to court with the help of Pro-Life organization Operation Rescue. A report of what happened to Lexi was also given to the  Colorado Committee of Health and Human Services at a hearing.

The hearing was about a bill that would require abortion facilities in Colorado to follow health and safety regulations in a similar way to medical clinics. Expert witness Dr. Keri Kasun gave testimony on what an unrestricted and unregulated Planned Parenthood had done. She confirmed that Planned Parenthood had delayed Lexis emergency treatment and stated that Lexi had been showing obvious symptoms of an amniotic fluid embolism. The risk of this complication is elevated for abortions later in pregnancy, and Lexi was even further along than she had been told at 22 weeks pregnant. (A premature baby born at this age could survive when given care.)

Amniotic fluid in the bloodstream would impair clotting abilities, making any injuries inflicted on Lexi much more dangerous. The further delays by not treating this as the emergency it was made everything worse.

In response to the bill and to the investigation of their egregious actions, the Public Affairs Manager for Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains (which oversees the oversees Fort Collins chain location) argued that they shouldnt be supervised or regulated and called the corporation a beacon of hope that would ""always fight for their patients"". But as Troy Newman from Operation Rescue put it, **This Planned Parenthood did not care if Lexi Arguello survived her complications. If they had, staff would have called an ambulance the minute she exhibited symptoms, and they would have requested lights, sirens, and any other measures that might have saved Lexis life.**

I didnt even think I could be pregnant. I used to be forced into prostitution and had an eating disorder and other medical conditions that doctors told me it would be impossible for me to get pregnant.

i know there are people out there dying from bombs everyday and im here, one year later, still thinking about the day i lost everything.

Ive been trying to find funding for an abortion for weeks. I even went to a clinic that said they offered support which I misunderstood completely and I told them I didnt want to see anything. They end up doing an ultrasound, they had the audio on so I heard the heartbeat, and then they printed a photo for me to keep. They then at the end of the appointment told me they dont have the resources to help with abortion. Only prenatal, postpartum and adoption services. And then they kept me there for 30 mins telling me why I should follow through. So for two weeks it ate at me and ate at me.. but, I dont want to follow through.

Ive decided on an abortion as my partner and I just arent ready at this time - were looking for a bigger house as we are in a tiny house with no space for anything and we are trying to improve our quality of life.
I am an anxious person and I understand that having a baby is going to be stressful and an anxious time, and If we are going to do it at some point, I want to remove as much of that anxiety as possible. I feel having a bigger house and being in a space where we can do it at least removes some of that anxiety. I genuinely cannot see us with a baby in this space currently. 
I did come off the pill about a year ago as I didnt want to be on it anymore and at that point we sort of said just see what happens, but have been careful and used condoms where we could. Since then my anxiety/OCD has gotten worse and now its actually happened I just cant go through with it, for our sake and a childs sake.
I did go to my GP last week as I had some bleeding and cramps (which he said were normal) and the pregnancy was confirmed there and documented on my record.
I told him I was no longer on the pill and he asked me if I was keeping the pregnancy. I panicked and said yes as I was scared hed judge me when Id just said I came off the pill.
Now I have my consultation next week and Im worried that when the GP surgery finds out Ive had a termination that I will get in trouble.
I know you dont have to tell your doctor but as its on my record that Im pregnant, I dont want to turn up at a next appointment (whenever that may be) and they think Im still pregnant.

I know that he has a visa that limits him on the type of companies that will sponsor him, which is something he complains about everytime we speak. I am scared he is going to use our child to get a family visa.

I also have an underlying condition which could cause me to have a difficult pregnancy and having to go through all that by myself, will be difficult. 

I am thinking about having an abortion but I feel bad as I did all this to myself and should have been more careful. Am I selfish for considering an abortion?",abortion,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jc2m49/am_i_selfish_for_considering_an_abortion_uk/
2025-03-15,1742030442.0,We both want abortion but my wife can't get over the fears from her beliefs. How can i help her?,"Hi guys,

I seriously need your help on this, and this is a long one.

We just got married, and we f'd up. We know this is our mistake and we are blaming ourselves for letting this happen.

My wife and I just found out she's pregnant a few days ago, just a month after our wedding. The scan we did yesterday didn't even show the embryo inside the uterus, so we still have time to decide what to do. It's very early. It's too early even to do a MA. Now our initial reaction and up to even now after a few days is that we are not ready to have kids. We still want to enjoy our lives and no matter how we go through the scenarios in our head and together, we can not imagine and cannot accept the reality that there will be a children in our life, at least at this time. We fully believe having a kid will more likely leave us with more suffering, and unhappiness. We've talked to great lengths about this and agree that we will be most happy and content with just each other.

But my wife is a firm believer in Buddhist teachings, and she believes that we'd be committing a major sin, akin to murder and she seems to be unable to overcome this to get the courage to make the final decision. And i don't know how to help her get through this. I believe that the decision we want to make will lead to less sufferings, and better for all parties involved. But I fear that if we decide to have an abortion, she will also not be happy and will be in tremendous mental pain and I don't know if she will even be able to heal from it.

We are also super torn due to the fact that other than our own selfish needs and the vision that we have for our life together, there's no other reason to have this abortion. We are happily in love, both our families are well off, incredibly kind, helpful to us and will be over the moon if we reveal to them about the pregnancy. There's no real financial strain to speak of to take care of the baby if we let this happen. In our culture people believe that having children is a blessing, so there's no chance of talking to anyone else in our families about this, because we will face massive judgements that will make it impossible to even speak about an abortion, so that leaves us alone to work this out.

I've tried to convince my wife that this is not a crime, and we are making this decision believing it will be best for our life together, that what ever is inside her right now is not yet a living human being, and if we make this decision with kindness in our hearts, there is no need to fear of guilt, karma or anything like that. But she is dismissing me everytime I mention it and doesnt want or unable to let go of her strong beliefs. I can see that she's in the middle of a crossroads and cannot find a way out that she can accept. She's in great pain, and I'm feeling it too.

Anyways.. I was with, well hes still here, a guy that I have known since I was 15 (he is not the father of my other children). 
I recently found out I was pregnant. I am almost 11 weeks along. He has one child of his own, and that child is a handful. The mother is not involved and he has no family to help him.. lately all its been is him smoking weed all day and just laying on the couch. I have been extremely depressed and have no motivation for anything and I have been very sick. When I first told him I was pregnant (this was a surprise as I was on birth control), he right off the bat told me to get an abortion.. which is upsetting because he always used to tell me he doesnt believe in it.  Until eventually he changed his mind when he brought up he can go work somewhere far when the baby is born to make money. Which seems odd.. but oh well. Anyways.. skip to today, I can not be with this man. His child is a handful, all four of mine are easier to handle for a full day than his kid in an hour. Everytime he even tries to cuddle me or be close shes climbing on him and giving no personal space. So I told him to move out. At this point I feel like he is using me for a place to stay.. he only pays half of rent, and I pay the other half and all utitlies and all of groceries. I am sick of feeling like Im raising his kid and him and I dont feel its fair to my child. 
I have had someone tell me to get an abortion, but I dont believe in that. But I dont know.. I guess I need words of encouragement.. am I doing the right thing keeping this baby.. this baby has a heart beat and ten fingers and ten toes, and I feel I have enough love to give. Or is it selfish of me.. Im just so sad, and I just dont know what to do anymore. Im at a loss. Im so depressed.. I cant eat , I cant sleep, I cant do anything but stare at a wall.

2025-03-15,1742060312.0,AITA for not wanting anyone besides my medical team/midwife in the delivery room?,"Planning to have a natural/unmedicated birth of my first child, and ideally just want to deliver with my medical team.

I work in the medical field myself, and have attended a handful of births during my training,

I dont feel the need to have my mother/family/in-laws physically present in the room as I push, even if they are adamant about this.

Furthermore, my husband is fantastic, wonderful, and supportive - but he is also the person who will 100% pass out at the first sight of blood (flashback to me picking him up off the floor after our dog cut their foot with moderate bleeding&.)

For this very short window of time where I want to be in the proper mindset and in the zone to do this without medication, I simply dont want to have to worry about any family members in the room, or my husband striking his head on the floor *when* he inevitably passes out at the first side of blood. For this short period of time, Im really not interested in the stop and chat or social visits while I am in pain and trying to get through this, before or during delivery.


For some background, I have a wonderful relationship with my family/ in-laws and they will be very involved in our childs life, but I was raised very strictly religious and incredibly modest, so it seems odd for people who have constantly checked me for modesty my whole life and not wanted to even see my calves,
Suddenly feel the need to be present to watch me stretch my perineum and take a bloody bowel movement &..

I am incredibly shy, modest, and introverted. I am a grown adult of decent fitness and literally feel uncomfortable wearing shorts in public, so no Im not excited to have an audience for this, husband included. 

Of course I dont want him to miss any part of his childs life, but I also dont want him to get hurt *when* he passes out and I dont want to feel like I am the one constantly looking over to make sure he is ok during this time. We have talked about it and he would like to be there but is also realizing he probably wont do well. Maybe for our next child, I myself dont know what to expect and want to do this my way, but will have my midwife present as my advocate.

I was joking that my ideal fantasy is to get to the hospital too early, they say its going to be a long time until delivery, so I tell my husband to go home and get some sleep or go to work for part of the day instead of sitting around, I pop this baby out and tell him to come back to meet his son when its all over lol

I feel that this is an intimate, intense, short period of life that I would like to have what little control over it that I can.

Just looking for anyone else who has felt this way or decided to deliver this way. 



TLDR; 
Want to deliver on my own in the hospital without an audience.

Any tips for setting boundaries for the delivery room?

Our families will be very involved and everyone is excited to welcome them,

2025-03-15,1742010191.0,Can I stop eating for baby at 37W?,"TW diet and food 

TLDR because whiney and ranty, sorry : Im due any day now, does my diet still affect the babys development? 

Im normally a healthy eater and love to eat, but pregnancy has been hard on the diet front. Terrible nausea and food aversion during 1st trimester which caused weight loss, somewhat back to normal during 2nd, but the nausea returned by the 3rd along with acid reflux and indigestion, and I never experienced any cravings. Never in my life I thought that eating would become a chore. 

Ive been forcing myself to eat certain things that i particularly dont enjoy for the time being. I normally love flavorful stuff, herbs spices, etc but they all now cause nausea, now I can only have bland stuff. On top of that, Ive been trying to reduce acid and indigestion which means extra boring food, and I just try to eat to meet the minimum recommended macros because Im afraid Ill otherwise cause harm to the baby. To make up for possible lack of nutrients, Im taking so many vitamins and supplements including protein powder, and often thats enough to make me full. All in all, meal times have been stressful. 

Ive now reached 37 weeks and everything is uncomfortable but Im so thankful that things are looking good so far. My weight gain as well as the babys growth is well within the recommended range. At this point, it seems like all the major fStal developments have already happened, and Im far from malnourished. So Im wondering if it would be ok for me to eat more carelessly now for the sake of my own digestive comfort. I feel extremely heavy and exhausted all the time and no amount of calories is helping. It feels like theres no more room left in my body for any food. The baby is very energetic and moves constantly which is both comforting, psychologically and uncomfortable, physically, but I see this as a sign that hes well fed? So can I stop worrying about nutrition at this point? Obviously Im not talking about consuming alcohol and ultra processed trans fat. I just want to eat simple carbs in small amounts and be protein deficient for now until my appetite and digestive system goes back to their pre-pregnancy condition.

I know this is why they say to get to know the person youre having a child with. But I truly loved him when this all started. He is hardworking, stable, and secure. He provides and cares for me. He loves me in all the ways that he can. But I just dont feel happy anymore. 

He left for a business trip, so Im home alone and pregnant with a house maid. Life is comfortable enough. But I feel so lonely. So fucking lonely. I cry every night. He calls twice, thrice, as much as he can. But I just feel nothing. I feel numb. Maybe Im just depressed? Maybe Im just& lost. 

This is the worst time to feel this way. Im giving birth in 2 months. Im hoping its just a phase because hes gone. I dont think that I can do this alone. His flaws are shining bright when hes far away. I see all the ways I ache because of him and I see all the ways I will forever feel lacking because of him. Now more than ever. 

These business trips will always happen, they must. So I will be lonely again. But next time with a baby. I dont know if its better to have a sad mother or a hungry one.

2025-03-15,1742022860.0,Cant forgive husband for asking for a paternity test.,"TW: loss.

We got married in December 2023. A month or so before the wedding I got off birth control and got pregnant right away. When I was around 7 weeks, my husband asked for a paternity test. It absolutely crushed me, I cried for hours and ended up bleeding. The pregnancy ended a few days later.

I had 4 chemicals after and got pregnant again in August 2024. That pregnancy ended in October 2024. The paternity test hasnt been discussed since and honestly I assumed he got over it considering me tracking each ovulation, making both of us go through many tests to figure out whats wrong, etc.

Long story short- I got pregnant again in November 2024 and am now almost 17 weeks. We had guests over a few weeks ago and I was discussing crazy pregnancy dreams and one of them was giving birth to a baby with a different skin color. Everyone laughed because the discussion was lighthearted but my husband suddenly said something like and then you wonder why I want to do the test. My jaw dropped and the other woman over got very defensive for me.

He brought up the subject again a few days ago and we got in a major fight. He says he doesnt think I cheated but that since this baby stuck, maybe I got inseminated behind his back as maybe his sperm didnt work. I offered to look at all medical records of mine and reminded him of being on a shit ton of medication to sustain this pregnancy.

He stands his ground and basically belittles me and any argument I have about this being hurtful. His main point is that he is a man and has no way of knowing the baby is his.

For context:
I work from home, literally never go out unless I have a female friend over. Never spend any nights away from home and take care of 3 dogs. I physically wouldnt have time to cheat nor have I ever considered doing that. My husband also works from home and has access to all my devices/location on my phone.

I dont know what kind of advice I am looking for. I have not forgiven him for asking for the first paternity test and am simply disgusted by his behavior. 

Edit:

I wanted to thank everyone for weighing in. So much food for thought, I am glad to know I am not overreacting. I already agreed to the test as long as it is done privately as I am deeply ashamed of having to go through it. I wont divorce my husband over this but I will do everything in my power to make him seek therapy that he goes to regularly and not a couple times like he used to.

Having read through all the responses I realize it is not a me problem but rather an insecurity of his that is being projected onto me and our son.",pregnant,149.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jbpmkf/cant_forgive_husband_for_asking_for_a_paternity/
2025-03-15,1742038168.0,"30 weeks pregnant, little to no movement in the last 36 hours","I'm 30 weeks pregnant today and so far, baby girl has been very active the entire pregnancy. On all the ultrasounds my doctor said how she's very active and since I started feeling her kicks (started quite late with me around 25 weeks), I can also tell that she's an active one.

But for the last ~36 hours she's completely silent. I felt like 1-2 really minor movements this morning, but other than that, nothing.

I know many babies have a growth spurt at 30 weeks and that can cause them to be move less. But as a mom I'm still worried, as it's so usual for her. I tried to get her to move, moved around myself and carefully massaged my belly to get a reaction from her, but so far nothing has helped.

Should I go to the hospital? Should I wait some more? I would be very thankful for some insight and advice on this =O

UPDATE: I had a CTG done and everything seems to be okay. Of course 5 minutes after starting the CTG, baby girl started kicking.

I'm currently waiting for an ultrasound to be on the save side, but the midwife said she expects me to be able to go home real soon.

Thanks to everyone for being concerned for baby girl and me!

2025-03-14,1741991016.0,"My husband wants more kids, are my conditions unreasonable?","When I met my husband I was a fence sitter. Over time I warmed up the idea and decided Id be okay with one baby. Husband wanted three, but was glad I was open to one. We got married and after a year of trying I got pregnant with my little girl who is due in June.

Now tell me why this man is watching me suffer and is already talking about a second baby??
We had discussed right before I got pregnant that I MIGHT do two, but we dont know what pregnancy and parenthood will be like and Im not rushing to make that decision before we see what life is like with a baby.

He keeps saying the baby needs a sibling and he really wants a boy and a girl. I thought on it and decided under certain conditions I could be open to one more, definitely not three.

My conditions: 
1. We must be comfortable with the political and economical climate at the time specifically in regard to womens rights and maternal rights.

2. After breast feeding husband pays for a breast lift and tummy tuck if needed.

3. He must be okay with stopping at 2 even if we have another daughter. By stopping at 2 I mean he will get a vasectomy.

Husband is willing to accept 1-2 and says even if its another girl hed gladly stop at 2 babies so she can have a sibling. 

However, he says he will not get a vasectomy. I explained in detail how its reversible and much safer than me getting my tubes tied. He insists we can continue to use condoms and plan B as needed. I told him currently in the USA they are working to ban birth control, abortion, and plan b and we will have no fall back if I get pregnant at 40 which we both agree we wouldnt want another kid at that age.

Is this unreasonable? He says he doesnt want to mess with his downstairs and I rolled my eyes and reminded him what Im doing to my body for us to have a child.

My husband has been kind and taken good care of me through this, but I feel Ive compromised a lot and met him half way on our ideals with what our family will be like. Is a vasectomy really asking too much??

Edit: Id like to point out as there seems to be some confusion. Id never force my husband to have a vasectomy. Its simply a condition if he wants a second child which is something he wants.

I was worried about breastfeeding after but my milk came in immediately and my LO and me did skin to skin as soon as I woke up, which was more or less 30-45 minutes after she was born.

2025-03-15,1742042496.0,Husband keeps putting his phone on airplane mode,"Im 36 weeks pregnant and I live at home with my husband who has a difficult time sleeping. He often goes to sleep in the guest bedroom down the hall.

I dont mind typically, since I know he struggles with sleeping. However now that Im deep in the third trimester, I need him to be available. And often during the night&he isnt.

2 weeks ago, I had very bad pains for an hour that stopped me from being able to switch sides or even get out of bed. I felt like a beached whale. I tried calling him and texting him, but his phone was on do not disturb and he didnt add me as a person to get through to him when I needed to. After about 20 mins, I was able to get up and crouch my way over to the room down the hall where I angrily woke him up. Bc hes such a disturbed sleeper, he anxiously started yelling what what what! At the top of his lungs at me. I was really upset, bc I felt when I needed him around for our baby, he wasnt there. He was angry for about ten minutes that I woke him up and was grumbling about how I get to nap during the day and he doesnt, but I wasnt having any of it. Respectfully I told him to shut his mouth and do/say nothing unless its about being there for me. Im Puerto Rican and I dont play that . Turns out the baby dropped 2 centimeters!

A couple days later, Im up in the am and hes still sleeping in. My 2 40 pound dogs are on me and Im so big I cant get them off. I try calling him, since I made myself a do not disturb contact and wouldnt you know, he put on his airplane mode! So I couldnt reach him regardless. His excuse was well I went to the other room at 6 am and I figured you were up and youd be fine. Suffice it to say, I was NOT happy. I told him he cant do this, that he needs to be reachable at all times, even if Im just downstairs. 
What if I fall? What if Im in pain again and cant move? What if the dogs wont let me get up? I said if he did it again, there would be big problems.

Now today, same thing. This time, he slept in the other room all night and the dogs are crying to be walked and Im texting/calling him..his phone is off. Im trying to yell for him..but he isnt hearing me. He also planned on waking up this am to go for a quick shake out run since hes running a half marathon tmrw. His mother is landing from Minnesota in a half hour and hes not up. I made it clear that we need to turn over the guest room for her, and need to sweep downstairs. I cleaned pretty much the whole house in prep for her yesterday. Went to Costco to do my final prep run for freezer meal prep for us, so he doesnt lose his mind cooking meals and making a mess bc I wont be able to help much, AND went to his race expo with him to pick up his bib and help him navigate it. Its his first big formal race and Ive ran multiple halfs and a marathon. So wanted to show my support for him.

Why is she coming? Bc he needs to go to a work conference for a week in Utah and the only way Id let him go is if he made sure someone was with me. Bc Im always tired and always need some help.

Am I being a brat or unreasonable to want my husband to not put his need for sleep over making himself available to me in my last month of pregnancy? He is other wise a wonderful husband during the day for the most part. Helps me clean the kitchen after I cook, will do some laundry, help clean the bathroom when I ask, walk the dogs when he can etc. He can be a little selfish from time to time with his day, but who cant? 

Im just getting so annoyed that I have to keep having this convo with him and Im debating telling his mother. Although I dont know what that will do..she tends to coddle him lol. Ive done a lot of work to get him to be less coddled lol. Ive also done a lot of work to get myself to a point where I dont just pop off on him. Being a New Yorker and Latina, thats my instinct. But he doesnt respond well to that and says Im being disrespectful and wont engage with me.

Sorry for the rant everyone. Any advice? Am I being nuts? Thanks!

Update: I popped off on him via text and told him Im telling both of our parents he keeps doing this. He said sorry and that his phone gets put on airplane mode automatically and its just habit. Well it wasnt a habit when he had it on do not disturb and we got into a fight over that right? Now that I can reach him through DND, now its a years long habit lol. I just told him that the fact that he didnt make it a priority to be cognizant of before bed shows how careless and selfish hes being.  I def got tough and rude with him and he told me to stop a few times, which promptly got met with a stfu >7<ý@. Now hes up and trying to check and see if Im ok.

They said its too early for a stress test which is fine took a urine sample and put some monitors on for a bit. Monitors all looked great and no contractions or protein in urine (not sure if they tested for any UTI or not) and sent me on my way saying its probably just baby growing.

They are asking for sugar levels to be below 5mmols pre meals and below 7mmols post meals. Im getting more and more depressed. Nowadays my sugar is all over the place despite watching my diet and insulin. After having an apple for breakfast would increase my sugar to over 10mmols, just one apple!!

I am only 11weeks pregnant and this is getting worse no matter what I do. I just wanna not eat anything nowadays because I am so scared of my blood sugars going up. My partner is keeping telling me to stop watching the continuous blood sugar monitor but thats what I do pretty much all day long, thinking omg this is so bad for the baby!.

This pregnancy has been 6 months of constant GI struggles and Im so tired. I was debilitatingly nauseous until about 20 weeks, and Ive also struggled with painful gas and heartburn. I barely slept last night bc of the gastric reflux and the impossible task of finding a comfortable position. Im still eating enough but its gotten to the point where Ive almost developed a fear of food. I dont know if its my organs shifting around or what, but lately things just hurt and burn (or maybe Im just hungry I dont know.) I find myself wondering if food will just make me feel worse, or sometimes its more like apathy, like Im just so tired of needing to eat so often. But then the stomach acid gets worse if I have an empty stomach, sometimes it wakes me up at night and I have to eat a bowl of cereal. I have woken up to myself choking on my own vomit/stomach acid more than once, despite sleeping popped up on pillows. I didnt know whether to label this post as a rant or seeking advice. I feel like the only thing that will help at this point is giving birth. I wish I could fast forward to the end. I try to remind myself at least I dont have other symptoms like sciatica (yet) or GD. I dont know. Im exhausted every day even though I dont really accomplish anything. Doing a load of laundry is a big task these days. I literally do not even remember what it feels like to feel normal, kindof like when youve had a cold for weeks and you cant even remember what it feels like to breathe through your nose (which funnily enough, Ive also had constant rhinitis since October.)

Maybe this is just a rant. I alternate between tums, gasx, Pepcid, etc its like Ive tried everything and it only kindof helps. Maybe Ill ask my OB for a refill of reglan bc it feels like food just sits and rots in me and doesnt move along like its supposed to. Pregnancy is just so sucky and hard and honestly lonely. I dont have any pregnant friends and my mom and MIL and husband are all supportive but its like idk what can anyone say? I hate how my mom hasnt been pregnant in decades and has clearly forgotten (or maybe really never experienced) how truly awful it is. Everyone just wants to celebrate how magical it is and meanwhile I hate this. Im so excited to finally be a mom and have my son, but everything else about this experience is ass. I have a feeling the third trimester is just going to slowly become more and more uncomfortable until I get to the point where I just want to do nothing but lay around like Jabba the Hut until my body decides its going to attempt to expel a whole ass human from my vajayjay. My baby is the reward at the end, but even then its like out of the frying pan and into the fire with birth, breastfeeding, sleeplessness, etc.

I got lucky and my annual exam ended up being my first appointment at 5w. All was looking good. Then I had some spotting so of course I worried. No cramps, no flow so I tried to remain calm. 

My next appt was at 8w and I was convinced Id get bad news, all was good, strong heartbeat and we got to see the little bean>. Then I had more frequent spotting sometimes bleeding so more freaking out. It seemed like the longest two weeks waiting for my next appointment.

Next up, 10w and NIPT. Baby was looking good, strong heartbeat. Then came waiting for the results so more worry. Results came in 2 days ago: low risk baby girl=. I felt brief excitement for 2 days and then last night, more spotting/bleeding and some light cramping. So Im back to worrying.

My next appt is 3/17 for NT screening and I am emotionally exhausted. Part of my worry is my doctor hasnt found a reason for the bleeding.

At 37w I got what felt like a sudden outburst of a rash on my stretchmarks that only got worse and worse. Its now all over my stomach and spread to my butt!! Apparently, it's PUPPP, which I didn't even know existed!! I hit most of the markers for it: FTM, Huge baby, Male baby, and rapid weight gain. My doctor confirmed it was PUPPP this past Wednesday and shared his sympathies. He told me all I can really do is take an aveeno oat bath and take benadryl in moderation.

I spend so much of my energy trying not to rip my stomach apart scratching.
I've tried a lot. Sarna, benadryl, calamine lotion, witchhazel, oat baths, tar soap, cold compresses. 
So far the only thing that works is taking an aveeno oatmeal bath in lukewarm/cold water, using fragrance free cerave moisturizer, cold compresses, and not wearing clothes or getting hot. It's not a 100% change. I still itch after a bit, but it isn't usually the unbearable itching.

2025-03-15,1742007283.0,35 weeks. Need advice. What do I do after a non-fault car accident leaves our family with no income?,"Hello. I am located in SC, United States. Throwaway due to us still being in legal proceedings with the Car accident. I am currently 35 weeks pregnant with our first, and I am high risk. My husband got into a car crash last week that has left him with a broken leg in two spots. The car was totaled, and the other party was cited as 100% at fault. We have no idea how he is alive but I am unbelievably amazed that he is. His recovery is looking like 4-6 weeks, with no surgery. This will be confirmed at various follow ups so unfortunately until he heals, I do not have an exact timeframe. I am grateful that this does not currently look like a long term injury.

We have done the correct things regarding the accident, such as reaching out to our insurance, the other driver's insurance, and a family friend's recommended personal injury lawyer. I am following the advice of my lawyer regarding the car accident, but I am looking for advice regarding how to pay our bills in the meantime. Due to the nature of his injury, this is looking like it will be a relatively long settlement period while he recovers. We expect a reasonable amount at the end of this.

At this time, we have one remaining vehicle that is paid off and are not worried about getting a second anytime soon. The car involved in the accident was in my father's name and he will be receiving the car settlement, not us. The injury settlement will be what I am going to receive at the end of this. We live paycheck to paycheck and due to my high risk pregnancy, I am currently off work. Prior to the accident, at the end of our bills we have $80 for gas, and my father/WIC are covering our groceries. My husband barely makes just enough for us not to be eligible for food stamps. I do not have any disability pay or paid maternity leave. My husband just started a new job two months ago and is not eligible for disability or paid leave. Following the accident, my husband is unable to complete training at this time and is going to be placed on unpaid administrative leave until he is cleared by his doctors to continue training. I understand that in the settlement this will all be paid for due to the lost wages, but in the meantime, we are trying to not have our house foreclosed or our lights turned off, or bills go to collections. I have tried applying for a personal loan and we were denied due to lack of income. He has two small credit cards, and I have one small credit card (total credit borrowed less than $2,000). They are all at about 90% of max. We were denied for all credit increases due to paying the minimum amount and not more. We have been denied opening new lines of credit due to lack of income at this time. We are as prepared as we can be for the baby, and I plan to return to work as soon as I am able.

We do not have any friends or family with the funds to pay our mortgage and bills in the meantime while we wait for the settlement money.  Our church paid our mortgage and electric bill in January when I was put on unpaid maternity leave. I am trying to reach out to other churches and associations in our area but unfortunately most of the population is struggling in this economy and there's only so much money to go around. We have filed a deferment for the mortgage but it is not looking like they will give us more than a month. We already did a loan modification in January which was screwed over by an increase in escrow anyway. We are not eligible for another modification anytime soon. Our monthly expenses are not that high. Total is less than $3,500 a month for mortgage, bills, and utilities.

At this point, I feel like my only option is go fund me and pray. Our community has been wonderful, neighbors and friends helping me with chores, etc. so it's really just figuring out how to pay our bills in the meantime.

Can anyone please give me advice on how to proceed? Is there an option I'm missing? To reiterate, I am not asking anyone here for money, just advice. I'm terrified of being foreclosed on with a newborn because of this car accident.",pregnant,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jbllja/35_weeks_need_advice_what_do_i_do_after_a/
2025-03-15,1742041437.0,Giant baby,"I'm 32 weeks, considered high risk for my age and also because my first kid was very small at full term (5lb 13oz) so I have a lot of ultrasounds. 

This kid has consistently been measuring 3-4 weeks ahead since our anatomy scan, but they haven't changed my due date. Yesterday they told me he was &gt;99% across the board and estimated at 6lb 4oz. Four weeks ago he was 3lb 3oz so if he keeps growing at this rate I'm looking at a 11+ pound baby by 40 weeks.

I know the scans aren't always accurate but they've been showing he's measuring ahead consistently for the past 4 scans. Dr says they will not induce before 39 weeks but that they will want me to have a c-section if his growth doesn't slow, which has me really upset. I really wanted to avoid a c-section. I've been overwhelmed and grouchy since I got this news yesterday, and I just needed to get all this off my chest. My partner has been trying to make me feel better with humor, which normally helps but is just annoying me right now, and my other people irl don't seem to understand why I'm upset.

We made the mistake of telling family our name idea for our son (due in July). No one likes the name and a few of my family members have sort of ruined the name for me - they think it's ""old fashioned"" and ""stupid"" and my mum has even said it reminds her of a celebrity with the same name who is a major asshole which further ruined the name for me!. I spoke with my partner about this and we spent a while looking at other name ideas. We kept disagreeing on every name that we found, but we did eventually find one that we both like. The issue is my partner still prefers the original name we had chosen and thinks it's special because we've been calling him that name the whole time.

2025-03-15,1742034035.0,"I want to improve relationship with my mom, but I cant stand her","Im 26 weeks pregnant and my mom insists on staying at my house during postpartum to take care of me, but she hasnt cared much for me during pregnancy and I seriously cannot stand her, even though I love her very much.

Until now, she has come to visit me once, never texted or asked me about my conditions, said she would visit us but cancelled last minute twice. 

Today is my parents wedding anniversary, she told us to come for dinner but I said we would come over for lunch because I have other things. I came and she said she didnt know I would not be staying for dinner. I told her I had work that I cant miss, Ive been very stressed out about work that I woke up at 2am and cant fall back to sleep for several nights already. I was exhausted, the house was small there is no room for me to rest, so while my parents took afternoon nap in their room, I had to lay on the floor in the living room. I ended up leaving around 3pm because I didnt want to torture myself.

My husband and I are very private person, we dont like having other people in our house so we purposefully only built two rooms, one for home office and the other our bedroom. When my mom told me she would come over to stay, I told her we didnt have a room, and she said why built such a badly designed house. She wanted me to do postpartum confinement for at least 2 weeks without touching water (meaning no shower), and I said no. The argue only ended with my dads intervention telling my mom her way was very old-fashioned and not suitable anymore. I told her Ill let her know if I needed help, but Im not making any arrangements for now.

The thing is, I know my mom cares and her love language is food, but she talks too loudly and too much, and her obsession with food drives me nuts. Whenever I talked to her about other things, she brushed them off. I had so much childhood trauma with my mom I cant bring myself to be open with her anymore.

When I was a kid, I told my mom my hair was falling out but she didnt care until I was almost bald. She laughed at my handmade gift to her and told me it was ugly. In uni I asked her to bring home (southeast asia) some pottery and glass I made and treasured very much, she left them at my cousins house in the US. When I asked to move out because I didnt feel comfortable living together, she threatened to cut ties because she was afraid of what others might say. She never said sorry to me once. Honestly, I dont think my feelings matter much to her. Shes controlling, and loves my brother because he would listen to her demands all the time. I have stopped telling her anything going on with me because she would brush them off, telling me we earn a lot of money so those are not really problems.

Im afraid my relationship with my mom will affect the relationship with my child, and I really want to have a loving, open relationship with my mom. I know its two-way, Im also part of the problem as Im too independent and like spending time alone. I feel more at ease to be with my cats than with my mom because I dont have to talk or entertain them. I know my mom will be a great help once baby comes, but I cant bring myself to ask her anything. Im afraid Id be too annoyed at her and make myself even more tired.

2025-03-15,1742060638.0,Baby Shower with just my side and friends?,"Im sorry this is going to be long. Please indulge me and let me know if Im rushing to judgment. The women in my husbands family (MIL and SIL) are a nightmare. We got married this past summer and MIL and SIL made it a nightmare. When my husband and I were dating, I liked them fine and I thought they felt the same, but when we got engaged, I felt like they turned on me and I still dont know why. 

They did nothing to help and showed no interest in my shower, bachelorette, rehearsal dinner, or wedding, despite my making the giant mistake of asking SIL to be a bridesmaid, which she accepted. 

SIL lied about being sick the day before my bachelorette to avoid having to go after being late to pay my sister for her share and completely ignoring the bachelorette and bridesmaids group chats for months. She was so sick she couldnt make it, but went out to a bar the night of while we were celebrating and posted pictures. When I confronted her about that, she told me she was hungry and had to eat something. My husband said something to SIL and MIL that SILs behavior hurt my feelings, and MIL took SILs side. 

After that, I lowered my expectations to zero with these people. Despite that, 36 hours before my wedding, SIL and MIL texted me to ask if 24 year old SIL could bring a friend to the wedding. I responded as nicely as I could that unfortunately no, as the seating chart and place setting counts had gone to the coordinator and caterer already and the signage and details had been finished, so there was no room for last minute additions. I got K in return. Not to mention that SIL had in fact been invited with a plus one but never RSVPd at all or mentioned wanting to bring anyone. 

After that, MIL and SIL retaliated by showing up late to our rehearsal, refused to participate and opted to sit outside the chapel with bitch faces on during rehearsal, then continued acting outwardly bitchy to anyone and everyone throughout the rehearsal dinner. 

The day of our wedding, MIL told my husband she would not be coming and he spent the morning having a huge fight with her until she was satisfied to show up. MIL behaved fine enough at the wedding. SIL did piss me off by changing out of her bridesmaid dress the second the reception started and instead deciding to wear a clubbing style body con mini dress, which was a choice. I ignored MIL and SIL on our wedding day, as I found it and still find it unforgivable to threaten not to go to your childs wedding, regardless of whether you end up showing up. 

The day after our wedding, I sent MIL a text saying that her behavior in the months leading to our wedding hurt me and took away from mine and her sons joy, specifically that her behavior at the rehearsal and rehearsal dinner embarrassed us and our other guests and that I resented having to play nice and encourage my husband to keep the peace throughout the summer when I would not accept that type of mistreatment from anyone else in my life, nor should he. I told her I felt we needed to have a conversation and that I felt I needed an apology before engaging with his family anymore. She blocked my number in response and then SIL sent me and my husband a text saying that my text to MIL upset her so much that SIL feared MIL would have a recurrence of breast cancer. 

My husband and I stopped speaking to his entire family after that, except for his father, who tried to play peacemaker with my husband for several months. The week before Christmas MIL and FIL invited us over to talk things out. I was shocked that MIL broke down in tears and profusely apologized. We accepted her apology and I felt it would be a nice gesture to say that I regretted texting her instead of speaking in person (honestly I dont feel that way  what I said was fair and was an invitation to a face to face conversation imo but I figured it wouldnt hurt to give something to get something). SIL never apologized for anything, and I never attempted a conversation with her. Shes honestly so selfish that I dont see the pointI was fine to just act like it didnt happen,  assuming she treated me fairly going forward. 

I am now 13 weeks pregnant, and we went over to MIL and FILs to announce babys gender and name to them with a blue ice cream cake last week. It was a pleasant time. Afterwards, my husband texted his brother and sister a photo of the cake to announce to them as well. SIL did not respond or acknowledge it. My husband is pissed (so am I) and went to MIL and FILs this morning, where SIL also lives, and asked SIL why she didnt respond. She said she doesnt look at or respond to group chats. He asked So you dont have anything to say to me or my wife when we tell you news like this? She said again she doesnt look at group chats. Husband called her some not nice names then started to leave. MIL overheard the argument and again took SILs side. My husband asked MIL why she would get involved when the last time she did the same thing and it broke up the family for months and he doesnt want that to happen again because their relationship has improved so much. MIL told him she doesnt think her relationship with him is good and she is still hurt by the wedding falling out. My husband left and called me to tell me what happened and that he wants to go back to not having them in our lives. 

I am so livid at these people.

It has really made me worry a lot. I feel so terrible for her she has 4 children already but has had a few miscarriages before, she is dealing with it really well considering, bless her soul. Its just made me concerned for the wellbeing of this baby, I have an appointment on Wednesday with the GP but will not have a scan until a few weeks from now. I am constantly nauseous I mean 24/7 if Im not nauseous I am asleep. I feel genuinely exhausted all day I can barely get up, my whole back hurts constantly. It feels truly debilitating, on top of that I am getting heart palpitations throughout the day, I really cant stand throwing up so I try hold it in but sometimes I cant, every smell makes me feel sick and I feel like I have super senses now and can smell every single particle in the air.  My partner is really supportive but he just doesnt have the perspective and I feel like Im being naggy and complaining constantly but its how I feel all the time.

I have recently lost my mother too who was like the pregnancy guru she had 6 daughters and 20 grandchildren and was present for almost every birth. I havent mentioned my pregnancy to my sisters because I found out so close to my sister miscarrying I dont want to bring it up for at least a few weeks

Ive marked this as a rant but feel free if you have any advice for me other than ginger biscuits haha

2025-03-15,1741998336.0,C-section rescheduled day of,"Today was supposed to have been my scheduled C-section. I (32 female 39 weeks and 5 days pregnant) had everything, literally everything, I could think of done, cleaned, prepped and figured out. So of course the day prior my fiancé comes down with an illness. Mind you I've been extremely hyper vigilant on avoiding any illnesses this entire pregnancy. I wear disposable gloves and use Lysol wipes at the grocery store, avoid crowded events and stay away from people who are experiencing any symptoms. 

Yesterday morning my fiancé woke me up to tell me he was ill so I had him take a 3 panel at home test for COVID19 and flu A&amp;B. Everything came back negative. I noticed that my throat was starting to feel sore as well so I called the labor&amp;delivery department where my csection was scheduled as well as my obgyn. They both said to just come regardless and even though my fiancé is sick with fever, chills, head/body aches, congestion and runny nose he could still come too. Of course we would need to take proper precautions though. 

I continued to finish my preparations last night with the hope that this was just the RSV, that I'm vaccinated from, currently going around but still i woke up this morning with extreme anxiety. Looking at my s.o. hardly able to stand I asked him to take another test. He did and tested positive for flu A. Mind you my fiancé isn't the greatest at self awareness. He has been constantly coughing into his hands and touching everything. The pets, grabbing silverware, light switches, door knobs and cabinets. I'm trying to stay as calm as possible repeatedly disinfecting things behind him and kindly suggesting that he frequently washes his hands, coughs into his shirt and avoids touching everything. 

I felt like my fate had already been sealed and I was about to have a C-section then come down with the flu with a newborn and have no one to help with the baby and C-section recovery. My fiancé is like the typical manly man that gets taken out by illnesses. Nothing against him but I know I wouldn't be able to rely on him to safely take care of the baby while avoiding transmission. So I called labor/delivery and they said they'd have my obgyn call me. He never did so I prepared to go in anyway and once I got there they had him on the phone and he said let's just go ahead and reschedule.

I was initially at first relieved because I can't handle the thought of doing all of this alone while sick. The thought of a newborn with the flu feels like a nightmare. Now I'm reading that pregnancy with the flu can cause still births. I am just so torn because my only concern is our baby and I worry if I made the wrong choice. I'm not sure exactly what I'm asking for on here. Maybe some shared experiences and advice. I wouldn't be able to live with myself if anything happened to my baby girl. My anxiety has been dragging me all over the place. Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read and respond to this.

My friend said her third was the smallest bump too, but her fifth was the one latest to show. Her fifth was 12 years after her fourth though, so her uterus and abdominal muscles had time to recover/strengthen again. Mine are literally back to back, so while my core is strong (ballet dancer), I had kinda expected to maybe show a bit earlier again this time (like I did with my second, compared to my first).

2025-03-15,1742059544.0,"22 weeks pregnant, ignored, dismissed and neglected by multiple clinics and the ER","First I want to start off by giving some background about me. Im a navy medic, I have my EMT license, I taken courses to improve not just emergency medicine but also outpatient clinics. In the last two years, Ive worked in medical research, surgical department, dentistry and paediatrics. My husband is also a medic but a little different where his focus is on tactical/emergency medicine. 

I do not like asking for help, no matter what it is so when I do ask, it means Im at my wits end. Last night was the first time I felt at my absolute lowest point and the last time I felt this way, I was 16 terrified my dad was going to really kill me. He was abusive and had strangled me and I fully accepted that I was going to die but he let me go and it took me a long time after that, after running away and even as an adult to learn how to not jump at the sound of a door opening or closing or to forgive him at a distance. 

Last night, I woke up from the worst cramp in my lower calf and it didnt go away for 20 mins. This wouldnt have worried me so much if it wasnt the 6th time I had generalised cramps that day. I woke up screaming in pain and I called my husband for advice (hes on deployment). In my mind, the worst thing to me was a deep vein thrombosis as Im currently on aspirin to prevent blood clots. I also have hypertension and have been prescribed labetalol and also on anxiety meds. I was going to call an ambulance but I work at this hospital and I didnt want anyone I work with to know I went in. I was in so much pain and I was so scared. 

Neglected: 
I went to the ER front desk hyperventilating and crying in pain. I told them I was having severe cramps in my leg and im 22 weeks pregnant. They told me I need to go to labor and delivery and I was so confused but I was like ok I just need to be seen. THEY SEND ME WITH ONLY DIRECTIONS WHEN IM CRYING AND AUDIBLY DISTRESSED AND IN PAIN TO FIND L&amp;D WHILE WITH AN OBVIOUS GAIT. Little to say I did not find the department and I broke down. I really did not know how to help myself, I left my phone in the car thinking I need to make sure my baby isnt being affected so I couldnt just call for help. I was found by a group of nurses who took me back down to the ER and there was no apology from the front desk. As someone who works in medicine, this truly made me disgusted at the type of treatment patients receive. I then was sent to a room where the nurse was very accomodating and helpful until her turnover. The only thing I will mention is she did not review my medications and questioned why my bp was so high. I had to tell her. After the turnover, no one checked up on me. My monitor was beeping to my bp that was 140s/110s and my pulse in the 120s range. My drip was completely dry and at that point I really needed to use the bathroom. No call button in sight, no one walking past to flag down so as I know how to disconnect myself, I just did it anyway because no one was going to help me. 

I felt like the doctor did listen to my concerns but the ER is to make sure youre not dying so when my labs came back normal, there was nothing more she could do for me which I understand. 

Ignored and dismissed: 
This was not the first time Ive asked for help this week. I was burnt out and went to sick call/ acute care to ask for help for my mental health. I have only been getting 3-4 hours of sleep on average a night the past week due to work load. I was dismissed by sick call by the technician because it was not an acute issue and to schedule with my primary care provider. 
So ok, look at the schedule. Zero availability for the next two weeks which is fine really, if I wasnt about to move cross country in 2 weeks. So after I got dismissed by that clinic and I didnt know what to do but knew I needed help, I went to behavioural health requesting for triage and just like that, no providers were available for triage. If I had not been pregnant, Id honestly consider jumping off the roof at that point but the only reason why I wanted help was because I wanted to make sure my baby was not affected negatively. So since they couldnt help me, I broke down in front of a doctor at work who happened to be a psychiatrist and actually helped me which I appreciate and he was able to speak to my leadership and set somethings in motion. I confessed to him my lack of hygiene, sleep and feeling like it was just all in my head. Ive been wearing diapers because I just dont have the time at work to just go to the bathroom when I need to.

 I went home that day, the sun still out, enjoyed a shower for the first time in a long time and went to bed that night with 7 hours of blissful sleep. Granted, waking up from cramps, it was so amazing. 

Overall, I dont think any of my concerns have been properly addressed and in a way, Im really glad that Im moving to be with my husband in 2 weeks and NOT having the baby here. This has been such an ordeal and I honestly dont know if I could survive postpartum here mentally. Ive completed ICE complaints and am thinking about speaking to the CO myself as how disgusted I am with the service that is basically neglect.

I recently found out that I am pregnant. This is a throw away for obvious reasons..I DO NOT want the father to find out this was ever a thing...... We live in a small town, and I am afraid to get it done anywhere he may hear about it.  He has ""joked"" before that if I ever got pregnant and he found out he would lock me in the basement until it was too late to terminate..... Like I get that it's a joke but that is completely terrifying. I guess that is what happened when his mom had him... If I am able to get it done and he finds out after, I fear he may react violently..  We recently broke up, and he has been calling me non stop alternating between angry and crying, Trying to get me to come over to talk to him. 
I am planning a week long trip out of town two weeks from now. The hotel is going to be expensive, and gas...After looking up the cost of the procedure, I do not know how I am going to be able to afford this ..... Is there any sort of organization that may help with the cost? I am freaking out. I am already about 4 months along, my periods are irregular to begin with and I had no idea until 2 days ago that l 8 was even pregnant..  is there any sort of at home type thing I could use ?

I don't know what to do :'( I am afraid it will be too late by the time I can save enough to afford everything....

2025-03-15,1742044973.0,"23w pregnant, caught covid, taking care of a ladie's pets for 2 weeks, constant dog walks and taking care of bf after surgery. What to do?","It all started when I was taking care of my neighbors pets, 2 rabbits, a cat and a wild pond turtle. After 3-4 days of taking of them, my ""allergic reaction"" to the Timothy hay got worse one night and so I went to the clinic to see if there was anything to do about it. Came back positive for Covid. Bf had major ACL/ meniscus surgery the next day and wasn't going to miss it as he's been waiting for a long time to get this procedure done.

It's been a week since the surgery. All the while I'm up taking the dog out on walks bc we live in an apartment so 3-4x a day and I try to be generous and try to be outside for least 10 min, and go to the field nearby to play fetch 2x a day. 

Taking care of the ladies pets, i live in the same building. I come by 1-2x a day. I've had to clean the cat box and need to do it again. She doesn't have a filtration system for the turtle tank and the bunnies would be stuck in a small cage if I wasn't paying attention to them. I've debated to invest my own money to get them set up better. Right now I'm even trying to potty train the rabbits. One is a boy and a girl and I've been trying to find somewhere cheap so she could get them fixed. It's stress I don't need but the lady is super nice and she's offered late night assistance once the baby is born and I believe she would help me. She can take care of a cat but I know she got bunnies and the turtle for when her granddaughter was living with her.  She's offered to have her friend take care of them and for the daughter to take the bunnies but I'm like it's only 3 days left, and I don't want any of the animals to rot in their cage. 

I'm trying to help my bf. He is pretty independent. I open the door, put his sock on or try to make him comfy. I helped him get on a schedule for his medication because it was very complicated and wanted to help him stay on track. I feel unloved a bit, I want to fit the ottoman into the couch but he tells me he doesn't want to struggle to get off the couch and I told him that I would move it if he needed to get up.....he's tried to be affectionate from time to time but his reasoning not to cuddle just sounds like an excuse. It makes me feel sad. 

I'm running around doing all this and my cough has only gotten worse and I've had a few hours of sleep. The last time I slept in, was till 11 am and he thought I was being lazy. I told him I  wasn't feeling good, but I was okay and that I thought it was only allergy symptoms. That day I remembered I had light sensitivity but blamed it on sinus congestion. 

I type this with a few hours of sleep. I can't sleep. I feel bad for my lil baby bc I'm constantly coughing and idk how much sleep he's getting. I still have an appetite but my stomach hurts on occasion. I've tried delyseum to get rid of my coughing but nothing. Now I'm worried it might some how be a bacteria in my system. I'm not congested but I'm constantly coughing with an occasional rattle when I lay on my side.  At one point I coughed and I threw up, and wished my bf would comfort me a little bit more. I'd start gagging over the sink and maybe once he asked me if I hit the inhaler.  coughing has only gotten worse. Has there been anything else safe to take to combat Covid symptoms?

Tomorrow I have to do laundry bc our dog has wet the bed twice. And the couch 3x. She needs to see a vet about her incontinence but bf keeps delaying it. My bf is frustrated but we both know she can't help it. I'm just overwhelmed. We're both sick.

I had my first ultrasound today and I'm 5w2d. The bump took up almost the entire gestational sac with just a sliver of fluid showing. My blood test showed my levels hcg and progesterone are rising normally so they scheduled another ultrasound in a few days. Now I feel like I'm growing this bump and not a baby with how big it is and not being able to even see the yolk sac and I don't want this to end in another loss ( 1st loss 5 years ago) anyone have experience with this or advice on how to deal? I have been dealing with infertility for over 8 years so I know not to get excited but I wasn't nervous before but now I am. Sorry for rambling, any response would be appreciated. Thanks!

2025-03-15,1742059054.0,CMV: The only reason why Trump wants to annex Canada and Greenland is because the Arctic is melting,"I don't understand why he doesn't just come right out and say this. He's said some vague things, like for ""national security"" or ""international security"":

Maybe an admission that the Arctic is melting might mean he'd have to acknowledge global warming is real, and it would upset his supporters who also believe it's a hoax. He's said many, many times it's a hoax:

He did kinda change is mind once though sort of:

And if he says it's real now, or even acknowledges the Arctic is melting, he'd have to admit he was wrong all those times before.

Regardless, the Arctic is melting, which means access to untapped resources and trade routes:

[https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2022/09/13/what-lies-beneath-melting-glaciers-and-thawipermafrost/](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2022/09/13/what-lies-beneath-melting-glaciers-and-thawipermafrost/)

Guess who has better access to all those resources and trade routes? Canada and Greenland. This is why he wants Canada to become the ""51st state"" and buy Greenland. r/Conservative had a literal article on their sub about Canadians who are thrilled to become part of the U.S. (it was from the Telegraph, UK) because I think they're trying to warm people up to the idea. Some of the comments on there were like, ""Okay, Alberta might be all right, but nobody else!"" But most posts over there about this subject are full of Conservatives that are flabbergasted and even kind of mad about his threats. It's not really popular even with them.

But the exact reason is Trump wants the resources in the Arctic and the trade routes. Period. And rather than just continuing friendly and peaceful relationships with the nations who have access to those resources, he'd rather just take away their sovereignty and make them part of this country, so they don't have control over them anymore.

I know he says a lot of things, and then will say the opposite of those things thirty seconds later, but he's kind of started to suggest global warming is good or beneficial:

[https://www.eenews.net/articles/trump-to-musk-climate-change-means-more-oceanfront-property/](https://www.eenews.net/articles/trump-to-musk-climate-change-means-more-oceanfront-property/)

[https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4826175-trump-climate-change-not-biggest-threat/](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4826175-trump-climate-change-not-biggest-threat/)

I believe he's saying those things because melting ice, not just in the Arctic, but in Antarctica too, would mean exposing resources that could make a nation--or an individual--very wealthy and powerful.

I don't know if he wants to get those resources for himself, his businesses, his family, or his billionaire friend's like good old Elon. Or he thinks if he gets this for the US, he'll be praised for it and it will be his legacy. And if the U.S. has direct access and has control over that area, it would mean certain types manufacturing and businesses would come back to the U.S., like he promised to do, especially if they can get stuff like rare earth minerals, natural gas, and oil. I don't know. It could be a combination of all those things.

But the point is that he wants Canada and Greenland because of the Arctic's resources. That's what he wants. I tried to find somewhere where he's actually said this, aside from ""drill baby, drill"" but he hasn't. Aside from the vague things about security mentioned above, and opening up Alaska for more oil drilling, that's about it.

Most news stories about Trump's threats to Canada and Greenland are super vague about it too or don't even mention it at all, but that is absolutely what it is. And, yeah, there's definitely a domineering colonizing, ""might makes right"" element to the whole thing, but the Arctic's untapped resources and trade routes are why he's doing all this.

I don't think it's for any kind of security b/c why not just take Mexico? If him and Conservatives believe that illegal immigrants crossing that border is a security threat, why not just take the whole country over? Or El Salvador or Honduras while they're at it? I don't believe he's using it as leverage for trade, because wouldn't that sort of move be best focused on somewhere like China? Even Trump's merch is made in China, and since they're the world's factory now, and he wants to bring all that manufacturing back to the U.S., you'd think he'd leave our neighbor to the north alone and focus on the country that we buy most of our shit from. I know he's put tariffs on them too, but they're only, what, like 10%? A lot less than Mexico and Canada. And does Denmark even have any sort of negative impact on U.S. trade? I'm pretty sure they get a lot of stuff from us, so how could that be motivator for a trade war? Those things just don't seem like good reasons. I know he's not known for being a thoughtful planner, but still.

Change my view and let me know what other reason there could be? I really think getting the resources and trade routes in the Arctic is the only reason.

2025-03-15,1742030442.0,We both want abortion but my wife can't get over the fears from her beliefs. How can i help her?,"Hi guys,

I seriously need your help on this, and this is a long one.

We just got married, and we f'd up. We know this is our mistake and we are blaming ourselves for letting this happen.

My wife and I just found out she's pregnant a few days ago, just a month after our wedding. The scan we did yesterday didn't even show the embryo inside the uterus, so we still have time to decide what to do. It's very early. It's too early even to do a MA. Now our initial reaction and up to even now after a few days is that we are not ready to have kids. We still want to enjoy our lives and no matter how we go through the scenarios in our head and together, we can not imagine and cannot accept the reality that there will be a children in our life, at least at this time. We fully believe having a kid will more likely leave us with more suffering, and unhappiness. We've talked to great lengths about this and agree that we will be most happy and content with just each other.

But my wife is a firm believer in Buddhist teachings, and she believes that we'd be committing a major sin, akin to murder and she seems to be unable to overcome this to get the courage to make the final decision. And i don't know how to help her get through this. I believe that the decision we want to make will lead to less sufferings, and better for all parties involved. But I fear that if we decide to have an abortion, she will also not be happy and will be in tremendous mental pain and I don't know if she will even be able to heal from it.

We are also super torn due to the fact that other than our own selfish needs and the vision that we have for our life together, there's no other reason to have this abortion. We are happily in love, both our families are well off, incredibly kind, helpful to us and will be over the moon if we reveal to them about the pregnancy. There's no real financial strain to speak of to take care of the baby if we let this happen. In our culture people believe that having children is a blessing, so there's no chance of talking to anyone else in our families about this, because we will face massive judgements that will make it impossible to even speak about an abortion, so that leaves us alone to work this out.

I've tried to convince my wife that this is not a crime, and we are making this decision believing it will be best for our life together, that what ever is inside her right now is not yet a living human being, and if we make this decision with kindness in our hearts, there is no need to fear of guilt, karma or anything like that. But she is dismissing me everytime I mention it and doesnt want or unable to let go of her strong beliefs. I can see that she's in the middle of a crossroads and cannot find a way out that she can accept. She's in great pain, and I'm feeling it too.

2025-03-15,1742042496.0,Husband keeps putting his phone on airplane mode,"Im 36 weeks pregnant and I live at home with my husband who has a difficult time sleeping. He often goes to sleep in the guest bedroom down the hall.

I dont mind typically, since I know he struggles with sleeping. However now that Im deep in the third trimester, I need him to be available. And often during the night&he isnt.

2 weeks ago, I had very bad pains for an hour that stopped me from being able to switch sides or even get out of bed. I felt like a beached whale. I tried calling him and texting him, but his phone was on do not disturb and he didnt add me as a person to get through to him when I needed to. After about 20 mins, I was able to get up and crouch my way over to the room down the hall where I angrily woke him up. Bc hes such a disturbed sleeper, he anxiously started yelling what what what! At the top of his lungs at me. I was really upset, bc I felt when I needed him around for our baby, he wasnt there. He was angry for about ten minutes that I woke him up and was grumbling about how I get to nap during the day and he doesnt, but I wasnt having any of it. Respectfully I told him to shut his mouth and do/say nothing unless its about being there for me. Im Puerto Rican and I dont play that . Turns out the baby dropped 2 centimeters!

A couple days later, Im up in the am and hes still sleeping in. My 2 40 pound dogs are on me and Im so big I cant get them off. I try calling him, since I made myself a do not disturb contact and wouldnt you know, he put on his airplane mode! So I couldnt reach him regardless. His excuse was well I went to the other room at 6 am and I figured you were up and youd be fine. Suffice it to say, I was NOT happy. I told him he cant do this, that he needs to be reachable at all times, even if Im just downstairs. 
What if I fall? What if Im in pain again and cant move? What if the dogs wont let me get up? I said if he did it again, there would be big problems.

Now today, same thing. This time, he slept in the other room all night and the dogs are crying to be walked and Im texting/calling him..his phone is off. Im trying to yell for him..but he isnt hearing me. He also planned on waking up this am to go for a quick shake out run since hes running a half marathon tmrw. His mother is landing from Minnesota in a half hour and hes not up. I made it clear that we need to turn over the guest room for her, and need to sweep downstairs. I cleaned pretty much the whole house in prep for her yesterday. Went to Costco to do my final prep run for freezer meal prep for us, so he doesnt lose his mind cooking meals and making a mess bc I wont be able to help much, AND went to his race expo with him to pick up his bib and help him navigate it. Its his first big formal race and Ive ran multiple halfs and a marathon. So wanted to show my support for him.

Why is she coming? Bc he needs to go to a work conference for a week in Utah and the only way Id let him go is if he made sure someone was with me. Bc Im always tired and always need some help.

Am I being a brat or unreasonable to want my husband to not put his need for sleep over making himself available to me in my last month of pregnancy? He is other wise a wonderful husband during the day for the most part. Helps me clean the kitchen after I cook, will do some laundry, help clean the bathroom when I ask, walk the dogs when he can etc. He can be a little selfish from time to time with his day, but who cant? 

Im just getting so annoyed that I have to keep having this convo with him and Im debating telling his mother. Although I dont know what that will do..she tends to coddle him lol. Ive done a lot of work to get him to be less coddled lol. Ive also done a lot of work to get myself to a point where I dont just pop off on him. Being a New Yorker and Latina, thats my instinct. But he doesnt respond well to that and says Im being disrespectful and wont engage with me.

Sorry for the rant everyone. Any advice? Am I being nuts? Thanks!

Update: I popped off on him via text and told him Im telling both of our parents he keeps doing this. He said sorry and that his phone gets put on airplane mode automatically and its just habit. Well it wasnt a habit when he had it on do not disturb and we got into a fight over that right? Now that I can reach him through DND, now its a years long habit lol. I just told him that the fact that he didnt make it a priority to be cognizant of before bed shows how careless and selfish hes being.  I def got tough and rude with him and he told me to stop a few times, which promptly got met with a stfu >7<ý@. Now hes up and trying to check and see if Im ok.

I went from 230lb down to 170lb over a year and a half. It was slow and steady, clean eating and being active. Part of the reason I wanted to lose weight was bc I wanted to be able to see my baby bump sooner after conceiving.

This pregnancy has been 6 months of constant GI struggles and Im so tired. I was debilitatingly nauseous until about 20 weeks, and Ive also struggled with painful gas and heartburn. I barely slept last night bc of the gastric reflux and the impossible task of finding a comfortable position. Im still eating enough but its gotten to the point where Ive almost developed a fear of food. I dont know if its my organs shifting around or what, but lately things just hurt and burn (or maybe Im just hungry I dont know.) I find myself wondering if food will just make me feel worse, or sometimes its more like apathy, like Im just so tired of needing to eat so often. But then the stomach acid gets worse if I have an empty stomach, sometimes it wakes me up at night and I have to eat a bowl of cereal. I have woken up to myself choking on my own vomit/stomach acid more than once, despite sleeping popped up on pillows. I didnt know whether to label this post as a rant or seeking advice. I feel like the only thing that will help at this point is giving birth. I wish I could fast forward to the end. I try to remind myself at least I dont have other symptoms like sciatica (yet) or GD. I dont know. Im exhausted every day even though I dont really accomplish anything. Doing a load of laundry is a big task these days. I literally do not even remember what it feels like to feel normal, kindof like when youve had a cold for weeks and you cant even remember what it feels like to breathe through your nose (which funnily enough, Ive also had constant rhinitis since October.)

Maybe this is just a rant. I alternate between tums, gasx, Pepcid, etc its like Ive tried everything and it only kindof helps. Maybe Ill ask my OB for a refill of reglan bc it feels like food just sits and rots in me and doesnt move along like its supposed to. Pregnancy is just so sucky and hard and honestly lonely.

I have a feeling the third trimester is just going to slowly become more and more uncomfortable until I get to the point where I just want to do nothing but lay around like Jabba the Hut until my body decides its going to attempt to expel a whole ass human from my vajayjay. My baby is the reward at the end, but even then its like out of the frying pan and into the fire with birth, breastfeeding, sleeplessness, etc.

Hello everyone!

FTM(31) here, 19 + 6. I had my regular prenatal appointment the other day, and one thing my doctor mentioned really stuck with me. She said its super important to stay active and keep my muscles in shape for the delivery. I didnt think much of it at the time, but now I'm starting to wonder what exactly she meant.

I've been going to the gym religiously (5 days a week for 1.5-2 hours) for the past 2-3 years. But since getting pregnant, I stopped going due to extreme fatigue in the first trimester. 
Now that Im starting to get my energy back, Im really struggling. Im almost always short of breath (just by existing) and cant even last 15 minutes on the stairmaster (level 6) without wheezing. 

I used to love lifting, but I cant even lift half the weight I used to pre-pregnancy. Honestly, even walking around the neighborhood feels exhausting.

What my doctor said really got me thinking and has me a bit worried, to be honest. Im wondering if anyone here can help me understand what she meant by keeping muscles in shape for delivery.

Is she referring to a specific muscle group? Or is it more about cardio? Im just feeling a bit lost on this one.

Last Monday, I told my husband about all the amazing things I was going to accomplish for myself and the baby during the rest of my pregnancy. Life was good.

What can expect for the future ? Am I imagining this ?

I must add that my mental health really took a turn for the worst this week.

2025-03-15,1742010191.0,Can I stop eating for baby at 37W?,"TW diet and food 

TLDR because whiney and ranty, sorry : Im due any day now, does my diet still affect the babys development? 

Im normally a healthy eater and love to eat, but pregnancy has been hard on the diet front. Terrible nausea and food aversion during 1st trimester which caused weight loss, somewhat back to normal during 2nd, but the nausea returned by the 3rd along with acid reflux and indigestion, and I never experienced any cravings. Never in my life I thought that eating would become a chore. 

Ive been forcing myself to eat certain things that i particularly dont enjoy for the time being. I normally love flavorful stuff, herbs spices, etc but they all now cause nausea, now I can only have bland stuff. On top of that, Ive been trying to reduce acid and indigestion which means extra boring food, and I just try to eat to meet the minimum recommended macros because Im afraid Ill otherwise cause harm to the baby. To make up for possible lack of nutrients, Im taking so many vitamins and supplements including protein powder, and often thats enough to make me full. All in all, meal times have been stressful. 

Ive now reached 37 weeks and everything is uncomfortable but Im so thankful that things are looking good so far. My weight gain as well as the babys growth is well within the recommended range. At this point, it seems like all the major fStal developments have already happened, and Im far from malnourished. So Im wondering if it would be ok for me to eat more carelessly now for the sake of my own digestive comfort. I feel extremely heavy and exhausted all the time and no amount of calories is helping. It feels like theres no more room left in my body for any food. The baby is very energetic and moves constantly which is both comforting, psychologically and uncomfortable, physically, but I see this as a sign that hes well fed? So can I stop worrying about nutrition at this point? Obviously Im not talking about consuming alcohol and ultra processed trans fat. I just want to eat simple carbs in small amounts and be protein deficient for now until my appetite and digestive system goes back to their pre-pregnancy condition.

I didnt even think I could be pregnant. I used to be forced into prostitution and had an eating disorder and other medical conditions that doctors told me it would be impossible for me to get pregnant.

2025-03-15,1742070086.0,"Do Women Have a Moral Duty to Keep Their Bodies ""Ready"" for Reproduction at All Times?","Late last year, Dr. Rebecca Gomperts (Aid Access, Women on Waves) announced results of a large clinical trial in Moldova, testing the use of a weekly low dose of mifepristone (50 mg) as a contraceptive. The results were promising, with only one pregnancy occurring within 2000 cycles. Furthermore, negative side effects were minimal, with only 4% of the participants experiencing any negative side effects (compared to a 40% negative side effect rate for conventional hormonal contraceptives). Additionally, the low-dose mifepristone was easier to use, requiring only one dose a week, and being more ""forgiving"" of variations in the time the pill is taken. And 89% of the study participants reported that they stopped menstruating while taking mifepristone as a contraceptive. (Probably most women would consider this a positive side effect.)

Because of the positive results, the trials have been expanded to the Netherlands this year. If the results continue to be positive, the plan is to apply to the European Medicines Agency for registration and market authorization to allow this weekly, low-dose mifepristone regimen as a contraceptive throughout the EU.

The method of action for mifepristone as birth control is two-fold: it reduces the rate of ovulation and it thins the endometrial lining of the uterus, making it impossible for a fertilized egg to implant.

([Source](https://msmagazine.com/2025/01/07/mifepristone-weekly-contraceptive-clinical-trials-abortion-pill-birth-control/).)

My primary question for PL supporters is this: 

* Would you have any moral or legal objections to women's use of such a contraceptive? If so, on what grounds?

Here are some secondary questions if you believe that the use of this contraceptive would be immoral:

* If a woman was taking mifepristone as described here *as a contraceptive* and informed her partner that she was doing this before they had sex, and if her partner, knowing this, decided to go ahead and have PIV sex with her, and if one of his sperm fertilized an egg but it failed to implant, whose would be the primary responsibility for the ""death"" of the fertilized egg? (Realistically, neither of them would ever know if this happened, so this is a hypothetical question.)
* *Men's* use of tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, red meat, and food high in trans fats during the months before their partners' conception is associated with higher miscarriage rates, because of these substances' impacts on sperm. ([Source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/a-mans-unhealthy-lifestyle-too-can-lead-to-his-partners-pregnancy-loss/articleshow/64072130.cms?from=mdr).)  If men engage in such unhealthy lifestyles, they are not maintaining their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction, and their choices could result in the ""death"" of a fertilized egg or even an embryo or fetus.

Currently 12+4 with our < post IVF loss at 12+5 March of last year. As you can imagine Im struggling mentally and emotionally as the sense of loss never really goes away but of course grateful for this spontaneous pregnancy after TTC for 4yrs.

Starting Monday this week my nausea has essentially disappeared, breasts tender but not near as sore as they have consistently been. Im tired, and feel more bloated than normal. But feel like Im functioning more than I have been in the last three months. My nausea has kept me out of work several days in the last few weeks so the almost sudden absence is really sending me for a loop. 

Last year my symptoms also disappeared the 12th week and we found out at our appt at 12+5 wed had a silent miscarriage around the 11 week mark. There was a reason for the MC and this year our 8wk appt everything looked great. So Im of course just spinning at this point. Need to make it through the weekend on my own as hubby is visiting family and Im visiting mine, opposite directions. Monday is our NT scan.

For a few days prior and after I was having light spotting. Some light pink but mostly light brown with very dark brown thick, stringy, bouncy clots occasionally. Called OB, nurse said to go the ER. ER detected no intrauterine pregnancy with an HCG in the 200s. Also detected 3.6cm cyst on left ovary. They diagnosed me with a miscarriage.

Cut to calling the nurse to let her know the diagnosis and schedule a follow up. I had my follow up yesterday on 3/12. They gave me an ultrasound and again, no signs of intrauterine pregnancy. Cyst had shrunk slightly to 3.2cm. They took my blood again and I got the results today.

HCG is now 513. Completely baffled by this, I call the OB and speak with the nurse. She says she suspects that I am still pregnant just very early and thats why nothing is showing on US.

I am so confused. I was pregnant, not pregnant and pregnant again within 6 days. I had already started grieving the loss. Now Im in a state of depressive shock until I know for sure. They scheduled me for another US on 3/31. I cant wait that long. I need to know. Something doesnt feel right. I have symptoms, breast tenderness, heartburn when lying down.

2025-03-15,1742009542.0,#Saytheirnames: 18-year-old Alexis Lexi Arguello (USA 2025),"18-year-old Alexis Lexi Arguello had just moved into her own apartment and was preparing to start her adult life when Planned Parenthoods negligence killed her.

Shortly after moving out, Lexi suffered a urinary tract infection, went to get medical treatment and found out that she was pregnant. Likely not sure what her next steps should be, Lexi ended up the Fort Collins Planned Parenthood facility. She was told that she was 20 weeks pregnant. Although the facilitys website claimed that they only did abortions before 20 weeks, they scheduled Lexi for one anyway. 

During the abortion, Lexi suffered life-threatening side effects. It was obvious that she needed emergency medical treatment (which Planned Parenthood did not provide and was in no way equipped for), but the staff delayed in calling an ambulance and let her deteriorate. When they finally did call the ambulance, they tried to conceal the damage done by requesting that the ambulance not use sirens. 

This was not unusual for the facility. Witness reports from protesters and numerous dispatch records documented that the facility's frequent emergencies were  mishandled in a similar way. Life-threatening medical complications were downplayed, and time and time again Planned Parenthood tried to hide what they did to their clients. Ambulances were requested to come without sirens and were frequently directed by staff to use convoluted and indirect routes to make it less obvious that they had yet another emergency. They even had paramedics approach the back instead of using the more accessible main entrance. The ""silent siren treatment"" left Lexi suffering without help for even longer, delaying care and decreasing her chances at survival.

On February 6, the day of the abortion, Lexi's grandparents were told that she was in the emergency room. Her family hadn't even known she was pregnant, and now they arrived to find her in the hospital with doctors desperately struggling to keep her alive. She had lost so much blood that a transfusion of seven liters still didn't improve her condition, and the multiple doses of epinephrine were not enough to keep her heart beating. Her oxygen was too low and despite the best attempts of the ER, her grandparents had *seen in [Lexi's] face that it was her end.* Her blood pressure and heart rate dropped again, and she died the same day as her baby.

Lexi's devastated family wanted to find some semblance of justice for her and will take her killers to court with the help of Pro-Life organization Operation Rescue. A report of what happened to Lexi was also given to the  Colorado Committee of Health and Human Services at a hearing.

The hearing was about a bill that would require abortion facilities in Colorado to follow health and safety regulations in a similar way to medical clinics. Expert witness Dr. Keri Kasun gave testimony on what an unrestricted and unregulated Planned Parenthood had done. She confirmed that Planned Parenthood had delayed Lexis emergency treatment and stated that Lexi had been showing obvious symptoms of an amniotic fluid embolism. The risk of this complication is elevated for abortions later in pregnancy, and Lexi was even further along than she had been told at 22 weeks pregnant. (A premature baby born at this age could survive when given care.)

Amniotic fluid in the bloodstream would impair clotting abilities, making any injuries inflicted on Lexi much more dangerous. The further delays by not treating this as the emergency it was made everything worse.

In response to the bill and to the investigation of their egregious actions, the Public Affairs Manager for Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains (which oversees the oversees Fort Collins chain location) argued that they shouldnt be supervised or regulated and called the corporation a beacon of hope that would ""always fight for their patients"". But as Troy Newman from Operation Rescue put it, **This Planned Parenthood did not care if Lexi Arguello survived her complications. If they had, staff would have called an ambulance the minute she exhibited symptoms, and they would have requested lights, sirens, and any other measures that might have saved Lexis life.**

For context I was 22 weeks on the dot and in California for the procedure. I also went to a planned parenthood.
I found out I was pregnant a month and a half before my abortion. I have super irregular periods, had no symptoms, no bump, nothing. When I found out I figured I was not far along and had an at home medical abortion that failed. I bled but my pregnancy test was never negative after that. I then decided to tell my boyfriend and my mom and booked an appointment at pp. My first appointment they ultrasound me and I was 21 weeks. I was in shock and soon after I started to feel him kick. They let me know it would be a two day procedure. I was terrified at first. I have extremely bad medical ptsd and am beyond terrified of doctors and needles. I did not sleep at all that week, but soon the fear of needles subsided and I was just sad. I spent a week feeling him kick. I felt like a mother and was so attached. I was two weeks away from the cut off in California and I made my choice for several reasons. Since I was unknowingly pregnant I was drinking for months and months while pregnant. I am also an avid vaper. On top of that I had the medical abortion. I could not live with myself if I brought a child into this world with chronic health issues, as that was what happened to me. I was put up for adoption and had chronic medical issues and hence the medical trauma. I felt I did not have enough time to check for health issues and I did not feel comfortable bringing a child into a world where I am not financially stable. I want to give my child the world and right now I was not capable of that. Me and my partner were adopted and know what the other side of that looks like so that could never be an option for us. I was overcome with grief but I knew what the right choice was, no matter how hard it was and still is. The first day of the procedure was the scariest for me. This was when they did the fetal injection to end the heart beat and did the dilation sticks. I was sick to my stomach over that shot, but I voiced that to my doctor and she could not have handled me better. She talked to me about my life the whole way through the procedure. The injection did not hurt, it was uncomfortable because I could feel how deep the needle was. The dilation sticks also did not hurt as she numbed me. The numbing shot was probably the most uncomfortable of them all but bearable. The next day I went in for the procedure and they knocked me out stone cold. I worked myself up for a lot of nothing. Medically it was not a hard procedure, emotionally it was. For anyone considering only you know the right decision for yourself.

2025-03-14,1741991016.0,"My husband wants more kids, are my conditions unreasonable?","When I met my husband I was a fence sitter. Over time I warmed up the idea and decided Id be okay with one baby. Husband wanted three, but was glad I was open to one. We got married and after a year of trying I got pregnant with my little girl who is due in June.

Now tell me why this man is watching me suffer and is already talking about a second baby??
We had discussed right before I got pregnant that I MIGHT do two, but we dont know what pregnancy and parenthood will be like and Im not rushing to make that decision before we see what life is like with a baby.

He keeps saying the baby needs a sibling and he really wants a boy and a girl. I thought on it and decided under certain conditions I could be open to one more, definitely not three.

My conditions: 
1. We must be comfortable with the political and economical climate at the time specifically in regard to womens rights and maternal rights.

2. After breast feeding husband pays for a breast lift and tummy tuck if needed.

3. He must be okay with stopping at 2 even if we have another daughter. By stopping at 2 I mean he will get a vasectomy.

Husband is willing to accept 1-2 and says even if its another girl hed gladly stop at 2 babies so she can have a sibling. 

However, he says he will not get a vasectomy. I explained in detail how its reversible and much safer than me getting my tubes tied. He insists we can continue to use condoms and plan B as needed. I told him currently in the USA they are working to ban birth control, abortion, and plan b and we will have no fall back if I get pregnant at 40 which we both agree we wouldnt want another kid at that age.

Is this unreasonable? He says he doesnt want to mess with his downstairs and I rolled my eyes and reminded him what Im doing to my body for us to have a child.

My husband has been kind and taken good care of me through this, but I feel Ive compromised a lot and met him half way on our ideals with what our family will be like. Is a vasectomy really asking too much??

Edit: Id like to point out as there seems to be some confusion. Id never force my husband to have a vasectomy. Its simply a condition if he wants a second child which is something he wants.

2025-03-15,1742009542.0,#Saytheirnames: 18-year-old Alexis Lexi Arguello (USA 2025),"18-year-old Alexis Lexi Arguello had just moved into her own apartment and was preparing to start her adult life when Planned Parenthoods negligence killed her.

Shortly after moving out, Lexi suffered a urinary tract infection, went to get medical treatment and found out that she was pregnant. Likely not sure what her next steps should be, Lexi ended up the Fort Collins Planned Parenthood facility. She was told that she was 20 weeks pregnant. Although the facilitys website claimed that they only did abortions before 20 weeks, they scheduled Lexi for one anyway. 

During the abortion, Lexi suffered life-threatening side effects. It was obvious that she needed emergency medical treatment (which Planned Parenthood did not provide and was in no way equipped for), but the staff delayed in calling an ambulance and let her deteriorate. When they finally did call the ambulance, they tried to conceal the damage done by requesting that the ambulance not use sirens. 

This was not unusual for the facility. Witness reports from protesters and numerous dispatch records documented that the facility's frequent emergencies were  mishandled in a similar way. Life-threatening medical complications were downplayed, and time and time again Planned Parenthood tried to hide what they did to their clients. Ambulances were requested to come without sirens and were frequently directed by staff to use convoluted and indirect routes to make it less obvious that they had yet another emergency. They even had paramedics approach the back instead of using the more accessible main entrance. The ""silent siren treatment"" left Lexi suffering without help for even longer, delaying care and decreasing her chances at survival.

On February 6, the day of the abortion, Lexi's grandparents were told that she was in the emergency room. Her family hadn't even known she was pregnant, and now they arrived to find her in the hospital with doctors desperately struggling to keep her alive. She had lost so much blood that a transfusion of seven liters still didn't improve her condition, and the multiple doses of epinephrine were not enough to keep her heart beating. Her oxygen was too low and despite the best attempts of the ER, her grandparents had *seen in [Lexi's] face that it was her end.* Her blood pressure and heart rate dropped again, and she died the same day as her baby.

Lexi's devastated family wanted to find some semblance of justice for her and will take her killers to court with the help of Pro-Life organization Operation Rescue. A report of what happened to Lexi was also given to the  Colorado Committee of Health and Human Services at a hearing.

The hearing was about a bill that would require abortion facilities in Colorado to follow health and safety regulations in a similar way to medical clinics. Expert witness Dr. Keri Kasun gave testimony on what an unrestricted and unregulated Planned Parenthood had done. She confirmed that Planned Parenthood had delayed Lexis emergency treatment and stated that Lexi had been showing obvious symptoms of an amniotic fluid embolism. The risk of this complication is elevated for abortions later in pregnancy, and Lexi was even further along than she had been told at 22 weeks pregnant. (A premature baby born at this age could survive when given care.)

Amniotic fluid in the bloodstream would impair clotting abilities, making any injuries inflicted on Lexi much more dangerous. The further delays by not treating this as the emergency it was made everything worse.

In response to the bill and to the investigation of their egregious actions, the Public Affairs Manager for Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains (which oversees the oversees Fort Collins chain location) argued that they shouldnt be supervised or regulated and called the corporation a beacon of hope that would ""always fight for their patients"". But as Troy Newman from Operation Rescue put it, **This Planned Parenthood did not care if Lexi Arguello survived her complications. If they had, staff would have called an ambulance the minute she exhibited symptoms, and they would have requested lights, sirens, and any other measures that might have saved Lexis life.**

I genuinely wish I couldve kept the baby, but Im not married just yet, still with the father who helped me through everything.

Its been really hard for me because I didnt want to tell anyone I was pregnant but people at my work found out and it stressed me out because I couldnt let my family find out and I dont want the news getting back to them. Im a strong baptist but Ive always had more relaxed views of abortion because I understood the need for them to be here.

I went to an incredible clinic out of state that took care of my mental needs while handeling the abortion with such great professionalism and humanity. But its killing me not feeling my baby moving inside me anymore, not being able to hold her.

I didnt even think I could be pregnant. I used to be forced into prostitution and had an eating disorder and other medical conditions that doctors told me it would be impossible for me to get pregnant.

When I finally told the father he was so strong and supportive, helping me through everything. But the weight of everything leaves us numb. I hold my babys prints and blanket and just cry. How long does this pain last?! I know I dont deserve sympathy but it kills me.

My question is because people at work know and have been texting me asking if Im ok, and Ive been ignoring getting back with them because I dont want people knowing about it. But I know when I come back to work people are going to ask and its going to kill me.

What do I say?? Especially in the area I live, abortion especially at the time I had it are extremely frowned upon. And I dont want work to become hostile but they will all know when they see me Im no longer pregnant.

I took my miso today at 2PM. After about an hour, the bleeding and cramps began. I passed several clots, and the cramps was also too painful. But, I am not sure if I already passed the fetus.

I am not 100% sure of how far along I am. My last period was last December 19. I took a PT by the end of January and it was negative. But, I experienced the symptoms and spotting around the 2nd week of February. I am aware that it is possible that the PT wasn't able to detect it yet in January because it's still early. And I only took 1 test that time.

So, if you count it based on my last menstruation, it would be around 11 weeks already. But, if I became pregnant in February, it's been only a few weeks. Therefore, it is possible that I won't recognize the fetus, right? =-

2025-03-15,1742024357.0,My person is being distant after the abortion,"hi everyone, Im 23 (f) and hes a 27 (m). In the last post I expressed how I had an abortion with the person I was seeing. I am fully recovered physically but mentally and emotionally disoriented. My person was somewhat supportive throughout the process but not exactly how I wanted him to be. He was going out a lot and speaking with other females. Me and him arent fully in a relationship but I wouldve appreciated him investing his time into me during these times. Recently he has been doing things that have been getting on my nerves. He would always plan to see me but cancel on the very last minute. He did this a good 3 times. He would reach out to me and call me to hang out but once I get ready he would flake. I feel like he was doing it on purpose and I called him out on his behaviour and decided to delete him and move on because I dont deal with men like that. He would constantly message/call apologising and would make more plans. I would forgive him naturally because of the soft spot I had for him during the pregnancy. If it wasnt for that, I wouldve disappeared. Just recently Ive seen him partying through other peoples instagram/snapchat stories and I thought it would be funny blowing up his phone. He took this to heart and told me can you stop being so clingy, I came out of a 5 year relationship she was clingy and I dont like it. I fuck with you but stop. He called me clingy in the past to but I never too it as offensive. This hurt my feelings because he said it out of anger.  I was just doing it to be annoying and he took it for a complete different meaning. It wasnt the best idea. I think he thinks I want a relationship with him because of natural loving nature. I am affection and loving to people and love to give. My plan during our time together wasnt to fall in love. However, with the excessive love bombing, he would say things like im falling in love, or when you become my mrs he would talk about marriage a lot in the beginning. Kinda scared me because I know what he was trying to do. I wanted to keep things causal but since I got pregnant I grew an attachment with him as any woman wouldve. He makes me feel bad for it and when I try to express my emotions he shuts down. Theres been loads of times he has annoyed me but I forgave him and moved on. In this case, I deleted him from social media out of hurt and few days later I tried to message on iMessage and hes giving me the silent treatment. Bear in mind we were together a week before the argument, having sex. He hasnt blocked me from iMessage but when I try to request him he ignores the request. When I did this in the past he said you can stay there and learn your lesson. When I was pregnant with him. Im not sure exactly what to do now, I want to leave one last message before I fully move on as I feel like one day sooner or later. Hes going to try to reconnect and Im going to feel emotionally disoriented again. I want to take this time to heal and fully move on without being disturbed. 



This is the message I want to leave 

I have to say I find your actions really selfish. There have been so many times when youve annoyed me, and Ive brushed it off and forgiven you. I did something to annoy you once, it wasnt the best idea, but I did it. I apologised, and Im ready to move on from it. But youre still taking it personally and saying things unprovoked. I never once said I wanted anything serious with you apologies if I gave you the wrong impression, but Im just a loving person, whether Im close to someone or not. Whats really hard to understand is that youre getting angry because I felt attached. Any woman in my position would have felt that way. And to make me feel bad about it, especially after everything Ive been through physically, emotionally, and mentally, feels inconsiderate. I dont understand why this is such a sensitive topic for you when Ive gone through it. This isnt me trying to argue with you but choosing to communicate better. You can continue with the silent treatment if you want, but just know that you wont hear from me again. 

I found out I was pregnant beginning of this year and had my abortion a week after finding out. I felt so de attached and empty for the first week then went through a few week where I was so depressed, lost, regretful. Looking back I should have asked for help or spoken about my feeling more with my close ones. 

 Anyways, I thankfully managed to get back to normal weeks after and I kind of stopped thinking about my abortion and baby.

I really thought I have recovered and moved on but maybe I havent? All I see now is babies and pregnant women. I cant stop thinking and day dreaming about pregnancy and being a mother. 

Has anyone got any advice? To clarify dates I had my abortion in January and my depressive stage lasted about 3 weeks. I was really hoping to be completely okay with it months after. I think I am scared that I could potentially go back to being in such a dark place. I look back and its super scary how unaware I was of how sad I truly was.

USA/PA/MD border kinda.,"Ive been searching for answers for weeks and weeks and the farther along I get, the more terrified I get. I have no friends. I have no family that cares about me.

I dont have my children at this time (I just got out of rehab and a recovery house a few months ago so still working on getting them back in my full care,) and that makes me feel even worse about getting pregnant. My boyfriend and I took a break, we were fighting A LOT, it was an almost three month break (up), and I stupidly got pregnant because the condom got stuck inside of me. Ive been trying to find funding for an abortion for weeks. I even went to a clinic that said they offered support which I misunderstood completely and I told them I didnt want to see anything. They end up doing an ultrasound, they had the audio on so I heard the heartbeat, and then they printed a photo for me to keep. They then at the end of the appointment told me they dont have the resources to help with abortion. Only prenatal, postpartum and adoption services. And then they kept me there for 30 mins telling me why I should follow through. So for two weeks it ate at me and ate at me.. but, I dont want to follow through. I want to get my own babies back first. They deserve so much better than what Ive given them in their lives. I called the national abortion fund and they told me as a head of household for one which Id technically be with me as a server making $2.33/hr and then $450/week I could not qualify for assistance. I dont see any of my hourly wages it gets garnished directly to child support for my children. So the $450 (if I make that) I have to pay the rest of my CS and get to and from work (i uber mostly as I dont have my own vehicle) I dont know where else to look. I dont want to do a Medication Abortion all alone especially not at 10 weeks+. I feel as if it will be traumatizing and it will make my mental health even worse than it already is and I do not want to relapse either because pain is a big trigger for me, so I would really like to just figure out how I can do it safely, with a professional, who can help manage my pain safely. I just cant justify keeping this baby with the factor of me being a year clean only; not having my kids, not having a car, like theres so many factors. I tried to keep this as short as possible.

I seriously need your help on this, and this is a long one.

We just got married, and we f'd up. We know this is our mistake and we are blaming ourselves for letting this happen.

My wife and I just found out she's pregnant a few days ago, just a month after our wedding. The scan we did yesterday didn't even show the embryo inside the uterus, so we still have time to decide what to do. It's very early. It's too early even to do a MA. Now our initial reaction and up to even now after a few days is that we are not ready to have kids. We still want to enjoy our lives and no matter how we go through the scenarios in our head and together, we can not imagine and cannot accept the reality that there will be a children in our life, at least at this time. We fully believe having a kid will more likely leave us with more suffering, and unhappiness. We've talked to great lengths about this and agree that we will be most happy and content with just each other.

But my wife is a firm believer in Buddhist teachings, and she believes that we'd be committing a major sin, akin to murder and she seems to be unable to overcome this to get the courage to make the final decision. And i don't know how to help her get through this. I believe that the decision we want to make will lead to less sufferings, and better for all parties involved. But I fear that if we decide to have an abortion, she will also not be happy and will be in tremendous mental pain and I don't know if she will even be able to heal from it.

We are also super torn due to the fact that other than our own selfish needs and the vision that we have for our life together, there's no other reason to have this abortion. We are happily in love, both our families are well off, incredibly kind, helpful to us and will be over the moon if we reveal to them about the pregnancy. There's no real financial strain to speak of to take care of the baby if we let this happen. In our culture people believe that having children is a blessing, so there's no chance of talking to anyone else in our families about this, because we will face massive judgements that will make it impossible to even speak about an abortion, so that leaves us alone to work this out.

I've tried to convince my wife that this is not a crime, and we are making this decision believing it will be best for our life together, that what ever is inside her right now is not yet a living human being, and if we make this decision with kindness in our hearts, there is no need to fear of guilt, karma or anything like that. But she is dismissing me everytime I mention it and doesnt want or unable to let go of her strong beliefs. I can see that she's in the middle of a crossroads and cannot find a way out that she can accept. She's in great pain, and I'm feeling it too.

I found out I was pregnant a month and a half before my abortion. I have super irregular periods, had no symptoms, no bump, nothing. When I found out I figured I was not far along and had an at home medical abortion that failed. I bled but my pregnancy test was never negative after that. I then decided to tell my boyfriend and my mom and booked an appointment at pp. My first appointment they ultrasound me and I was 21 weeks. I was in shock and soon after I started to feel him kick. They let me know it would be a two day procedure. I was terrified at first. I have extremely bad medical ptsd and am beyond terrified of doctors and needles. I did not sleep at all that week, but soon the fear of needles subsided and I was just sad. I spent a week feeling him kick. I felt like a mother and was so attached. I was two weeks away from the cut off in California and I made my choice for several reasons. Since I was unknowingly pregnant I was drinking for months and months while pregnant. I am also an avid vaper. On top of that I had the medical abortion. I could not live with myself if I brought a child into this world with chronic health issues, as that was what happened to me. I was put up for adoption and had chronic medical issues and hence the medical trauma. I felt I did not have enough time to check for health issues and I did not feel comfortable bringing a child into a world where I am not financially stable. I want to give my child the world and right now I was not capable of that. Me and my partner were adopted and know what the other side of that looks like so that could never be an option for us. I was overcome with grief but I knew what the right choice was, no matter how hard it was and still is. The first day of the procedure was the scariest for me. This was when they did the fetal injection to end the heart beat and did the dilation sticks. I was sick to my stomach over that shot, but I voiced that to my doctor and she could not have handled me better. She talked to me about my life the whole way through the procedure. The injection did not hurt, it was uncomfortable because I could feel how deep the needle was. The dilation sticks also did not hurt as she numbed me. The numbing shot was probably the most uncomfortable of them all but bearable. The next day I went in for the procedure and they knocked me out stone cold. I worked myself up for a lot of nothing.

I have to keep it a secret from most people in my life (including my family) and the guy who got me pregnant has been with me for it and hes mainly the only person other than my therapist who knows. However, he has made it very clear to me that he doesnt want a relationship with me and may never want one with me. He lives out of state and tomorrow hell go back home to all the other girls hes sleeping with and Ill just be that girl he knocked up. This whole experience has been scary and painful and emotional and after he leaves tomorrow, Im just gonna be alone. I feel so stupid. I feel so worthless. I feel so alone and unlovable. I dont regret this but I never wanted to be in this position in the first place. Getting pregnant has always been my biggest fear but I always thought if it were to happen, it would be with a partner. My ex of four years who I lost my virginity to dumped me a few months ago and I always thought if this nightmare came true, Id at least have someone who loved me. Instead I have a guy who Ive fallen for whos emotionally unavailable and just wants to have sex with me and all his other female friends.

2025-03-15,1742027301.0,Nervous! Question (and ramble) regarding GP,"So Im currently 7 weeks pregnant, if my workings out are correct.
Ive decided on an abortion as my partner and I just arent ready at this time - were looking for a bigger house as we are in a tiny house with no space for anything and we are trying to improve our quality of life.
I am an anxious person and I understand that having a baby is going to be stressful and an anxious time, and If we are going to do it at some point, I want to remove as much of that anxiety as possible. I feel having a bigger house and being in a space where we can do it at least removes some of that anxiety. I genuinely cannot see us with a baby in this space currently. 
I did come off the pill about a year ago as I didnt want to be on it anymore and at that point we sort of said just see what happens, but have been careful and used condoms where we could. Since then my anxiety/OCD has gotten worse and now its actually happened I just cant go through with it, for our sake and a childs sake.
I did go to my GP last week as I had some bleeding and cramps (which he said were normal) and the pregnancy was confirmed there and documented on my record.
I told him I was no longer on the pill and he asked me if I was keeping the pregnancy. I panicked and said yes as I was scared hed judge me when Id just said I came off the pill.
Now I have my consultation next week and Im worried that when the GP surgery finds out Ive had a termination that I will get in trouble.
I know you dont have to tell your doctor but as its on my record that Im pregnant, I dont want to turn up at a next appointment (whenever that may be) and they think Im still pregnant.
Any advice please?

We are thinking about getting the abortion pills. By I have several questions regarding complications and directions on the miso only manual. 

She is a little less than 4 weeks pregnant. Her last period was February (started 11th to 13th) and they mostly last about 5 days.

She doesnt really have any of the pregnancy symptoms, can the miso induce any symptoms that may get confused with pregnancy?

How much will the bleeding last totally? Even if an abortion is successful, how long will she be bleeding afterwards?

2025-03-15,1742062747.0,Confused on logic and rights,"I recently did a deep dive and it left me confused. My issue is that I still don't have a genuine grasp on the logistics behind PL. I understand that PL views every fetus as a full-blown person with rights. However, rights come with the clause of not being able to take away someone else's rights no matter how small they seem in comparison. This should extend to the fetus if they are a full-blown human. That is where my logic leads me. Even if we take away the status of human with rights leaving them with just human life, the PP can still use their bodily autonomy to remove it. 


Furthermore, it's not the fetuses fighting against abortion it is born people. It's people with peens and uterus. By taking away one uterus owner's bodily autonomy you take away all bodily autonomy for current and future uterus owners. That is what having equal rights is about no matter how big or small the person is their rights are equal. If you give yourself the right to decide on someone else's behalf the same can be said in reverse. You cause a car accident and you're the perfect match for the person who got hurt you can and will be forced to save them. I understand being morally against something but you can't turn it into legislation that takes away rights from people currently alive and future generations. Jehovah's Witnesses don't believe in blood transfusions but they don't turn it into legislation because not everyone believes what they do and they would be taking away people's RTL. This is where my logic leads.  


In contrast, the PC logic seems streamlined to me. You have the right to bodily autonomy meaning you control what happens to or inside your body. If you end up pregnant and don't want to be you have the right to end that pregnancy. You end up pregnant and you want it congratulations hope you enjoy the journey. When applying the fetus has rights, not much changes. You end up pregnant and don't want to be, it's in your body and it can't take away your right to keep itself alive nor can any born person. You end up pregnant and you want it congrats on the pregnancy. It's beginning to feel more and more like your rights matter as long as there isn't a fetus involved.

2025-03-15,1742040015.0,OCIA (RCA) Marriage Convalidation,"I am undergoing the OCIA process but seem to have hit a snag which is requiring my wife and I to a meeting with our pastor next Friday.

About a week ago, one of the deacons began to heavily push me about having our marriage convalidated before the Easter vigil (my wife is a cradle catholic just fyi). I told him that it would likely not happen as my wife is 37 weeks pregnant and we just have a ton of stuff going on in our life. We planned on doing the marriage convalidation anyways once I became a full catholic.  I have been called several times by several of our deacons and have made my position clear several times. This is now what has led to a scheduled face to face between our pastor and my wife and I.

I have a feeling they are going to say I cant continue forward unless I get my marriage convalidated and I feel that is not right. I cant find anything that requires that a Candidate must have their marriage convalidated in order to take the other Sacraments.

I feel strong in my position to wait and will likely not be strong armed into doing so (I chose Saint Thomas More as my intercessor a few weeks ago which seems fitting now).

Can anyone point me to any resources that are contrary to my belief?

For a few days prior and after I was having light spotting. Some light pink but mostly light brown with very dark brown thick, stringy, bouncy clots occasionally. Called OB, nurse said to go the ER. ER detected no intrauterine pregnancy with an HCG in the 200s. Also detected 3.6cm cyst on left ovary. They diagnosed me with a miscarriage.

Cut to calling the nurse to let her know the diagnosis and schedule a follow up. I had my follow up yesterday on 3/12. They gave me an ultrasound and again, no signs of intrauterine pregnancy. Cyst had shrunk slightly to 3.2cm. They took my blood again and I got the results today.

HCG is now 513. Completely baffled by this, I call the OB and speak with the nurse. She says she suspects that I am still pregnant just very early and thats why nothing is showing on US.

I am so confused. I was pregnant, not pregnant and pregnant again within 6 days. I had already started grieving the loss. Now Im in a state of depressive shock until I know for sure. They scheduled me for another US on 3/31. I cant wait that long. I need to know. Something doesnt feel right. I have symptoms, breast tenderness, heartburn when lying down.

2025-03-15,1742060312.0,AITA for not wanting anyone besides my medical team/midwife in the delivery room?,"Planning to have a natural/unmedicated birth of my first child, and ideally just want to deliver with my medical team.

I work in the medical field myself, and have attended a handful of births during my training,

I dont feel the need to have my mother/family/in-laws physically present in the room as I push, even if they are adamant about this.

Furthermore, my husband is fantastic, wonderful, and supportive - but he is also the person who will 100% pass out at the first sight of blood (flashback to me picking him up off the floor after our dog cut their foot with moderate bleeding&.)

For this very short window of time where I want to be in the proper mindset and in the zone to do this without medication, I simply dont want to have to worry about any family members in the room, or my husband striking his head on the floor *when* he inevitably passes out at the first side of blood. For this short period of time, Im really not interested in the stop and chat or social visits while I am in pain and trying to get through this, before or during delivery.


For some background, I have a wonderful relationship with my family/ in-laws and they will be very involved in our childs life, but I was raised very strictly religious and incredibly modest, so it seems odd for people who have constantly checked me for modesty my whole life and not wanted to even see my calves,
Suddenly feel the need to be present to watch me stretch my perineum and take a bloody bowel movement &..

I am incredibly shy, modest, and introverted. I am a grown adult of decent fitness and literally feel uncomfortable wearing shorts in public, so no Im not excited to have an audience for this, husband included. 

Of course I dont want him to miss any part of his childs life, but I also dont want him to get hurt *when* he passes out and I dont want to feel like I am the one constantly looking over to make sure he is ok during this time. We have talked about it and he would like to be there but is also realizing he probably wont do well. Maybe for our next child, I myself dont know what to expect and want to do this my way, but will have my midwife present as my advocate.

I was joking that my ideal fantasy is to get to the hospital too early, they say its going to be a long time until delivery, so I tell my husband to go home and get some sleep or go to work for part of the day instead of sitting around, I pop this baby out and tell him to come back to meet his son when its all over lol

I feel that this is an intimate, intense, short period of life that I would like to have what little control over it that I can.

Just looking for anyone else who has felt this way or decided to deliver this way. 



TLDR; 
Want to deliver on my own in the hospital without an audience.

Any tips for setting boundaries for the delivery room?

Our families will be very involved and everyone is excited to welcome them,

My boyfriend and I have a 1-year-old daughter, we have been living together in his parents' house since she was 13 days old, as we are STILL unable to move to a place we can call OURS for now, but in the meantime we both work, me as a freelancer in about 3 restaurants from Thursday to Sunday, and him as a logistics assistant, currently taking a forklift operator course to move up.

Context given and probably questions answered, let's go 
Me and my mother-in-law got along well in the beginning, nowadays we don't anymore 
A few days ago I was at my mother's house, my boyfriend was organizing the room and said ""my mother is washing some of Serena's clothes that came from her mother's friend because she said some of them already fit"" so I said ok, right? But I had seen every outfit in that bag and they were all still huge for her, but if she says so... 

Well, these days I was noticing that her wardrobe, which used to be full (even full of clothes that fit her), is now EMPTY 
Guys, I leave some clothes at my mother's house, and obviously clothes there until we lived there, it's always been like that and even then there was never as much of a shortage at my mother's house as here, I barely took my daughter's clothes when I went down and I didn't have to bring any from here because both houses didn't lack clothes for her, because since she was born, what she gets the most is clothes 

It turns out that after a while, I noticed her wardrobe was more empty, like a total of almost NOTHING, REALLY NOTHING, and then yesterday I remembered that he had said that to me, and then I asked ""do you remember that you said that your mother washed some of Serena's clothes?. ask her where she is, the wardrobe has nothing""

Then he didn't want to ask right away, I was impatient and asked him straight away, ""Filipe said you had washed some of Serena's clothes because you thought they would fit, where are they?"" 
Then she said ""Serena's clothes she WON and I bought them, I washed them and kept them in a place you won't know where because these are just """"""MINE"""" and hers, you keep taking her clothes downstairs and they never come back here ""yes, I take some to keep down there, but that's because UNTIL THEN THERE HAD NEVER BEEN MISSING HERE TOO and that thing about her ""she lives here, not there""

And I really noticed, many times when she gave serena a bath, the clothes she wore on my daughter, most of the time I NEVER EVEN SEE THEM, so like
Currently I'm creating the theory that she has a pair of my girl's clothes, she knows that her wardrobe is empty, even with her clothes stored SHE DOESN'T PUT THEM IN THE WARDROBE 

She literally keeps clothes that my daughter gets and the ones she buys just for her and I will probably never even know the quantity 
Sometimes it's not even ""missing"" it's just clothes that never went into her wardrobe

On top of that, Ive been trying to reduce acid and indigestion which means extra boring food, and I just try to eat to meet the minimum recommended macros because Im afraid Ill otherwise cause harm to the baby. To make up for possible lack of nutrients, Im taking so many vitamins and supplements including protein powder, and often thats enough to make me full. All in all, meal times have been stressful. 

Ive now reached 37 weeks and everything is uncomfortable but Im so thankful that things are looking good so far. My weight gain as well as the babys growth is well within the recommended range. At this point, it seems like all the major fStal developments have already happened, and Im far from malnourished. So Im wondering if it would be ok for me to eat more carelessly now for the sake of my own digestive comfort. I feel extremely heavy and exhausted all the time and no amount of calories is helping. It feels like theres no more room left in my body for any food. The baby is very energetic and moves constantly which is both comforting, psychologically and uncomfortable, physically, but I see this as a sign that hes well fed? So can I stop worrying about nutrition at this point? Obviously Im not talking about consuming alcohol and ultra processed trans fat. I just want to eat simple carbs in small amounts and be protein deficient for now until my appetite and digestive system goes back to their pre-pregnancy condition.

I got my labs back from labcorp and it showed my progesterone being 9 and that it was low because in the first trimester progesterone should be 11 or higher. Once the labs were posted onto the mychart it showed progesterone of 9 being normal but then in a much smaller font below that it says the first trimester levels should be at 11 or higher. I have had a previous miscarriage at 8 weeks and so obviously I may just be a little extra annoying about it but when I tried to talk to my doctor about it (which took many days because no one called me back) they said as long as im not bleeding/cramping its fine

I calculated my due date based on the first day of my last period, which was February 10. This would make my due date November 17. Then I got to thinking about my first pregnancy from 2021. Ive been consistently tracking my periods and the exact days where we did the deed since like 2016. I went back in the app to July and August of 2021 to see that my period was July 13-16, 2021, my supposed ovulation was July 14 (although I think its actually around July 16, being that I regularly have a 30 day cycle), and we did the deed July 24 and 26. If I were to calculate the due date based on the first day of my last period before I got pregnant (July 13), then the due date wouldve been April 19, 2022. I think I found out I was pregnant in like September though and soon after had an appointment where I was told my due date was May 21, 2022. I remember having to wait at least 2 more weeks for another appointment so I could get an ultrasound. It was at that appointment that I was told my new due date was May 17, 2022. At the time, I didnt know how they determined how far along you were. I just thought I got pregnant in August and that was that.

Hi everyone,  

This is my first post, and I really need some opinions and support. In my community, theres a lot of stigma around elective C-sections, and its making me feel even more anxious about my decision.  

I am 32 years old from India currently living in Australia. Im currently 37 weeks pregnant with gestational diabetes but no other complications. I have a strong fear of vaginal delivery and have been leaning towards an elective C-section. My husband was initially supportive, but after our last appointment, where the doctor discussed the risks, he became a bit hesitant and asked me to rethink it. However, he reassured me that he would support my final decision.  

I also have my mom coming to help for three months postpartum, so I know Ill have support during recovery. Despite that, I cant shake the guilt and pressure from the stigma surrounding elective C-sections.  

Id love to hear from others whove been in a similar situation. How did you handle the decision? How was your recovery? And if youve faced judgment for choosing a C-section, how did you deal with it?  

Thanks in advance for your thoughts!  ",pregnant,9.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jbfl3b/what_should_i_go_for_c_section_or_vaginal_delivery/

Anyways.. I was with, well hes still here, a guy that I have known since I was 15 (he is not the father of my other children). 
I recently found out I was pregnant. I am almost 11 weeks along. He has one child of his own, and that child is a handful. The mother is not involved and he has no family to help him.. lately all its been is him smoking weed all day and just laying on the couch. I have been extremely depressed and have no motivation for anything and I have been very sick. When I first told him I was pregnant (this was a surprise as I was on birth control), he right off the bat told me to get an abortion.. which is upsetting because he always used to tell me he doesnt believe in it.  Until eventually he changed his mind when he brought up he can go work somewhere far when the baby is born to make money. Which seems odd.. but oh well. Anyways.. skip to today, I can not be with this man. His child is a handful, all four of mine are easier to handle for a full day than his kid in an hour. Everytime he even tries to cuddle me or be close shes climbing on him and giving no personal space. So I told him to move out. At this point I feel like he is using me for a place to stay.. he only pays half of rent, and I pay the other half and all utitlies and all of groceries. I am sick of feeling like Im raising his kid and him and I dont feel its fair to my child. 
I have had someone tell me to get an abortion, but I dont believe in that. But I dont know.. I guess I need words of encouragement.. am I doing the right thing keeping this baby.. this baby has a heart beat and ten fingers and ten toes, and I feel I have enough love to give. Or is it selfish of me.. Im just so sad, and I just dont know what to do anymore. Im at a loss. Im so depressed.. I cant eat , I cant sleep, I cant do anything but stare at a wall.

Well prior to my first prenatal visit, I was eating fine, I was enjoying food and adjusting to smells of food as everything started to smell weird, and I was nauseous constantly but still very much able to eat. Well at my prenatal visit, my doctor said because I was starting at 190, I have a lot of extra risk as I am obese. I know Im mostly muscle and very well proportioned, and I am the furthest thing from fat. I wear a size 10-12 sometimes smaller. Something about it hurt me a little, shortly after all I wanted was fruits, and even that was not good tasting (I normally can eat an entire watermelon no issue) then I went out with my grandmother who has always stood up for me against drs calling me obese because she watched me go from looking healthy and fit to being able to see my ribs. I told her about what the drs said and she said well I mean I can pinch an inch everywhere now and the glanced down at my bloated belly. Ever since all I want now is popsicles and water. A diet I grew familiar with when I was just 15 years old. And now Im scared that this isnt just food aversion but a relapse into my eating disorder because of a few discouraging words.

I dont know when to euthanize my cat.,"Im almost 38 weeks pregnant with my first child and I dont know if it will be harder to euthanize my 11 year old cat before the baby comes or after. My cat has been with me through every thing and honestly has saved my life, she truly is my first baby. I dont want to put her down but I fear the time has come.  In August she started scratching her face open and has essentially been in a cone since then. Weve taken her to the vet on multiple occasions and spent hundreds of dollars trying to figure out why to no avail. She has severe arthritis and has extreme difficulty walking, is on a monthly pain shot and twice daily gabapentin. She no longer goes pee in the litter box but goes around it so puppy pads have been a life saver with clean up until recently I got worse when she started pooping on them too. She then walks through the poop and tracks it through the house while Im out at work. I wash her paws and body daily at this point. I cant imagine keeping up with the assistance she needs with a newborn here but always imagined her around to meet my child. She is in pain but she is still herself. I am soo torn and cry daily because her quality of life is just not there anymore and I know its probably time for her to go but cant imagine my life without her.  I know I will deep in grief when she goes and I worry about my babies health while she is still growing in me but I also worry about being able to take care of her outside of the womb if Im in a depressive episode from the hormone drop as well as putting my cat down.

At 37w I got what felt like a sudden outburst of a rash on my stretchmarks that only got worse and worse. Its now all over my stomach and spread to my butt!! Apparently, it's PUPPP, which I didn't even know existed!! I hit most of the markers for it: FTM, Huge baby, Male baby, and rapid weight gain. My doctor confirmed it was PUPPP this past Wednesday and shared his sympathies. He told me all I can really do is take an aveeno oat bath and take benadryl in moderation.

I spend so much of my energy trying not to rip my stomach apart scratching.
I've tried a lot. Sarna, benadryl, calamine lotion, witchhazel, oat baths, tar soap, cold compresses. 
So far the only thing that works is taking an aveeno oatmeal bath in lukewarm/cold water, using fragrance free cerave moisturizer, cold compresses, and not wearing clothes or getting hot. It's not a 100% change. I still itch after a bit, but it isn't usually the unbearable itching.

I was already happy my due date is approaching and now I really can't wait even more. Five days and I will be evicting my big boy. Hopefully this rash will heal quickly after.

I spoke with my partner about this and we spent a while looking at other name ideas. We kept disagreeing on every name that we found, but we did eventually find one that we both like.

Until now, she has come to visit me once, never texted or asked me about my conditions, said she would visit us but cancelled last minute twice. 

Today is my parents wedding anniversary, she told us to come for dinner but I said we would come over for lunch because I have other things. I came and she said she didnt know I would not be staying for dinner. I told her I had work that I cant miss, Ive been very stressed out about work that I woke up at 2am and cant fall back to sleep for several nights already. I was exhausted, the house was small there is no room for me to rest, so while my parents took afternoon nap in their room, I had to lay on the floor in the living room. I ended up leaving around 3pm because I didnt want to torture myself.

My husband and I are very private person, we dont like having other people in our house so we purposefully only built two rooms, one for home office and the other our bedroom. When my mom told me she would come over to stay, I told her we didnt have a room, and she said why built such a badly designed house. She wanted me to do postpartum confinement for at least 2 weeks without touching water (meaning no shower), and I said no. The argue only ended with my dads intervention telling my mom her way was very old-fashioned and not suitable anymore. I told her Ill let her know if I needed help, but Im not making any arrangements for now.

The thing is, I know my mom cares and her love language is food, but she talks too loudly and too much, and her obsession with food drives me nuts. Whenever I talked to her about other things, she brushed them off. I had so much childhood trauma with my mom I cant bring myself to be open with her anymore.

When I was a kid, I told my mom my hair was falling out but she didnt care until I was almost bald. She laughed at my handmade gift to her and told me it was ugly. In uni I asked her to bring home (southeast asia) some pottery and glass I made and treasured very much, she left them at my cousins house in the US. When I asked to move out because I didnt feel comfortable living together, she threatened to cut ties because she was afraid of what others might say. She never said sorry to me once. Honestly, I dont think my feelings matter much to her. Shes controlling, and loves my brother because he would listen to her demands all the time. I have stopped telling her anything going on with me because she would brush them off, telling me we earn a lot of money so those are not really problems.

Im afraid my relationship with my mom will affect the relationship with my child, and I really want to have a loving, open relationship with my mom. I know its two-way, Im also part of the problem as Im too independent and like spending time alone. I feel more at ease to be with my cats than with my mom because I dont have to talk or entertain them. I know my mom will be a great help once baby comes, but I cant bring myself to ask her anything. Im afraid Id be too annoyed at her and make myself even more tired.

I've been taking vitamins to help and they have greatly reduced the sickness in the mornings, but I am still constantly hungry. I am considering getting nuts and dried fruits to snack on throughout the day. Is this a sign that I am not getting enough nutrition at the moment? I do feel extremely physically exhausted on a daily basis in the evenings. Is there a recommended eating pattern that would help deal with the hunger? Thank you for any input.

2025-03-15,1742007283.0,35 weeks. Need advice. What do I do after a non-fault car accident leaves our family with no income?,"Hello. I am located in SC, United States. Throwaway due to us still being in legal proceedings with the Car accident. I am currently 35 weeks pregnant with our first, and I am high risk. My husband got into a car crash last week that has left him with a broken leg in two spots. The car was totaled, and the other party was cited as 100% at fault. We have no idea how he is alive but I am unbelievably amazed that he is. His recovery is looking like 4-6 weeks, with no surgery. This will be confirmed at various follow ups so unfortunately until he heals, I do not have an exact timeframe. I am grateful that this does not currently look like a long term injury.

We have done the correct things regarding the accident, such as reaching out to our insurance, the other driver's insurance, and a family friend's recommended personal injury lawyer. I am following the advice of my lawyer regarding the car accident, but I am looking for advice regarding how to pay our bills in the meantime. Due to the nature of his injury, this is looking like it will be a relatively long settlement period while he recovers. We expect a reasonable amount at the end of this.

At this time, we have one remaining vehicle that is paid off and are not worried about getting a second anytime soon. The car involved in the accident was in my father's name and he will be receiving the car settlement, not us. The injury settlement will be what I am going to receive at the end of this. We live paycheck to paycheck and due to my high risk pregnancy, I am currently off work. Prior to the accident, at the end of our bills we have $80 for gas, and my father/WIC are covering our groceries. My husband barely makes just enough for us not to be eligible for food stamps. I do not have any disability pay or paid maternity leave. My husband just started a new job two months ago and is not eligible for disability or paid leave. Following the accident, my husband is unable to complete training at this time and is going to be placed on unpaid administrative leave until he is cleared by his doctors to continue training. I understand that in the settlement this will all be paid for due to the lost wages, but in the meantime, we are trying to not have our house foreclosed or our lights turned off, or bills go to collections. I have tried applying for a personal loan and we were denied due to lack of income. He has two small credit cards, and I have one small credit card (total credit borrowed less than $2,000). They are all at about 90% of max. We were denied for all credit increases due to paying the minimum amount and not more. We have been denied opening new lines of credit due to lack of income at this time. We are as prepared as we can be for the baby, and I plan to return to work as soon as I am able.

We do not have any friends or family with the funds to pay our mortgage and bills in the meantime while we wait for the settlement money.  Our church paid our mortgage and electric bill in January when I was put on unpaid maternity leave. I am trying to reach out to other churches and associations in our area but unfortunately most of the population is struggling in this economy and there's only so much money to go around. We have filed a deferment for the mortgage but it is not looking like they will give us more than a month. We already did a loan modification in January which was screwed over by an increase in escrow anyway. We are not eligible for another modification anytime soon. Our monthly expenses are not that high. Total is less than $3,500 a month for mortgage, bills, and utilities.

At this point, I feel like my only option is go fund me and pray. Our community has been wonderful, neighbors and friends helping me with chores, etc. so it's really just figuring out how to pay our bills in the meantime.

Can anyone please give me advice on how to proceed? Is there an option I'm missing? To reiterate, I am not asking anyone here for money, just advice. I'm terrified of being foreclosed on with a newborn because of this car accident.",pregnant,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jbllja/35_weeks_need_advice_what_do_i_do_after_a/

2025-03-15,1742059544.0,"22 weeks pregnant, ignored, dismissed and neglected by multiple clinics and the ER","First I want to start off by giving some background about me. Im a navy medic, I have my EMT license, I taken courses to improve not just emergency medicine but also outpatient clinics. In the last two years, Ive worked in medical research, surgical department, dentistry and paediatrics. My husband is also a medic but a little different where his focus is on tactical/emergency medicine. 

I do not like asking for help, no matter what it is so when I do ask, it means Im at my wits end. Last night was the first time I felt at my absolute lowest point and the last time I felt this way, I was 16 terrified my dad was going to really kill me. He was abusive and had strangled me and I fully accepted that I was going to die but he let me go and it took me a long time after that, after running away and even as an adult to learn how to not jump at the sound of a door opening or closing or to forgive him at a distance. 

Last night, I woke up from the worst cramp in my lower calf and it didnt go away for 20 mins. This wouldnt have worried me so much if it wasnt the 6th time I had generalised cramps that day. I woke up screaming in pain and I called my husband for advice (hes on deployment). In my mind, the worst thing to me was a deep vein thrombosis as Im currently on aspirin to prevent blood clots. I also have hypertension and have been prescribed labetalol and also on anxiety meds. I was going to call an ambulance but I work at this hospital and I didnt want anyone I work with to know I went in. I was in so much pain and I was so scared. 

Neglected: 
I went to the ER front desk hyperventilating and crying in pain. I told them I was having severe cramps in my leg and im 22 weeks pregnant. They told me I need to go to labor and delivery and I was so confused but I was like ok I just need to be seen. THEY SEND ME WITH ONLY DIRECTIONS WHEN IM CRYING AND AUDIBLY DISTRESSED AND IN PAIN TO FIND L&amp;D WHILE WITH AN OBVIOUS GAIT. Little to say I did not find the department and I broke down. I really did not know how to help myself, I left my phone in the car thinking I need to make sure my baby isnt being affected so I couldnt just call for help. I was found by a group of nurses who took me back down to the ER and there was no apology from the front desk. As someone who works in medicine, this truly made me disgusted at the type of treatment patients receive. I then was sent to a room where the nurse was very accomodating and helpful until her turnover. The only thing I will mention is she did not review my medications and questioned why my bp was so high. I had to tell her. After the turnover, no one checked up on me. My monitor was beeping to my bp that was 140s/110s and my pulse in the 120s range. My drip was completely dry and at that point I really needed to use the bathroom. No call button in sight, no one walking past to flag down so as I know how to disconnect myself, I just did it anyway because no one was going to help me. 

I felt like the doctor did listen to my concerns but the ER is to make sure youre not dying so when my labs came back normal, there was nothing more she could do for me which I understand. 

Ignored and dismissed: 
This was not the first time Ive asked for help this week. I was burnt out and went to sick call/ acute care to ask for help for my mental health. I have only been getting 3-4 hours of sleep on average a night the past week due to work load. I was dismissed by sick call by the technician because it was not an acute issue and to schedule with my primary care provider. 
So ok, look at the schedule. Zero availability for the next two weeks which is fine really, if I wasnt about to move cross country in 2 weeks. So after I got dismissed by that clinic and I didnt know what to do but knew I needed help, I went to behavioural health requesting for triage and just like that, no providers were available for triage. If I had not been pregnant, Id honestly consider jumping off the roof at that point but the only reason why I wanted help was because I wanted to make sure my baby was not affected negatively. So since they couldnt help me, I broke down in front of a doctor at work who happened to be a psychiatrist and actually helped me which I appreciate and he was able to speak to my leadership and set somethings in motion. I confessed to him my lack of hygiene, sleep and feeling like it was just all in my head. Ive been wearing diapers because I just dont have the time at work to just go to the bathroom when I need to.

 I went home that day, the sun still out, enjoyed a shower for the first time in a long time and went to bed that night with 7 hours of blissful sleep. Granted, waking up from cramps, it was so amazing. 

Overall, I dont think any of my concerns have been properly addressed and in a way, Im really glad that Im moving to be with my husband in 2 weeks and NOT having the baby here. This has been such an ordeal and I honestly dont know if I could survive postpartum here mentally. Ive completed ICE complaints and am thinking about speaking to the CO myself as how disgusted I am with the service that is basically neglect.

2025-03-15,1741998336.0,C-section rescheduled day of,"Today was supposed to have been my scheduled C-section. I (32 female 39 weeks and 5 days pregnant) had everything, literally everything, I could think of done, cleaned, prepped and figured out. So of course the day prior my fiancé comes down with an illness. Mind you I've been extremely hyper vigilant on avoiding any illnesses this entire pregnancy. I wear disposable gloves and use Lysol wipes at the grocery store, avoid crowded events and stay away from people who are experiencing any symptoms. 

Yesterday morning my fiancé woke me up to tell me he was ill so I had him take a 3 panel at home test for COVID19 and flu A&amp;B. Everything came back negative. I noticed that my throat was starting to feel sore as well so I called the labor&amp;delivery department where my csection was scheduled as well as my obgyn. They both said to just come regardless and even though my fiancé is sick with fever, chills, head/body aches, congestion and runny nose he could still come too. Of course we would need to take proper precautions though. 

I continued to finish my preparations last night with the hope that this was just the RSV, that I'm vaccinated from, currently going around but still i woke up this morning with extreme anxiety. Looking at my s.o. hardly able to stand I asked him to take another test. He did and tested positive for flu A. Mind you my fiancé isn't the greatest at self awareness. He has been constantly coughing into his hands and touching everything. The pets, grabbing silverware, light switches, door knobs and cabinets. I'm trying to stay as calm as possible repeatedly disinfecting things behind him and kindly suggesting that he frequently washes his hands, coughs into his shirt and avoids touching everything. 

I felt like my fate had already been sealed and I was about to have a C-section then come down with the flu with a newborn and have no one to help with the baby and C-section recovery. My fiancé is like the typical manly man that gets taken out by illnesses. Nothing against him but I know I wouldn't be able to rely on him to safely take care of the baby while avoiding transmission. So I called labor/delivery and they said they'd have my obgyn call me. He never did so I prepared to go in anyway and once I got there they had him on the phone and he said let's just go ahead and reschedule.

I was initially at first relieved because I can't handle the thought of doing all of this alone while sick. The thought of a newborn with the flu feels like a nightmare. Now I'm reading that pregnancy with the flu can cause still births. I am just so torn because my only concern is our baby and I worry if I made the wrong choice. I'm not sure exactly what I'm asking for on here. Maybe some shared experiences and advice. I wouldn't be able to live with myself if anything happened to my baby girl. My anxiety has been dragging me all over the place. Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read and respond to this.

Starting Monday this week my nausea has essentially disappeared, breasts tender but not near as sore as they have consistently been. Im tired, and feel more bloated than normal. But feel like Im functioning more than I have been in the last three months. My nausea has kept me out of work several days in the last few weeks so the almost sudden absence is really sending me for a loop.

I'll go lay down and within minutes the cramps come back and it's excruciating. I contemplate going into the doctor each time. The cycle repeats itself until I've pooped 3-4 times (usually solid the first 1-2 times then it turns liquid). And after I'm done on the toilet the pain goes away.

I have a history of bleeding suddenly during sex but it has been gone since a few months and during pregnancy its been gone altogether. 

Obviously Im scared, but also trying to downplay it to myself since I've had this issue before pregnancy, but then the final conclusion was that I probably have weak uterus lining. However shouldnt then the mucus plug not keep that stuff inside?
Or could the tissue-like pieces have been my mucus plug, which came out because of the sex and releasing the blood? I'm so scared!

I obviously called my midwife right away when this happened, but she couldnt really tell me anything other than having to wait for whether the bleeding will continue and have certainty during the planned ultrasound on Tuesday.

Just wanna throw my symptoms out there and see if anyone has had anything similar happen to them.

Im 34+5 weeks and for the last few days I haven't been able to sleep for more than an hour or two at a time because it feels like every muscle from collar bone to crotch tightens up to the point of pain bad enough to wake me up. I can strech and it'll relieve the symptoms for a little while, but it comes right back within an hour. Sleeping propped up at a 45 degree angle helps, but I think that's only because it keeps the little one from being pushed into my chest as hard and squishing my organs when the muscles tighten.

A week ago I did go into preterm labor for about 4 hours. Luckily it stopped on its own before any big problems occurred, but my ob did say that I am not 1 cm dilated and about 50% effaced. The little one did drop into my pelvis and had a lot of pressure for about a day and a half until they came back up on their own. I do have medication available to me now to stop contractions if this happens again for the next 2 weeks where it'll be ok if I go into early labor.

I don't know if this has something to do with the early labor or just normal growing pains or what's going on. Just know that suddenly no matter what I do I can't keep my muscles from feeling like they're slowly strangling my insides. Fetal movement is good, lots of strong kicks like always. Honestly a bit too strong since I've got 3 bruised ribs.. and doc says heartbeat sounds strong and normal rhythm.

Im near the end of my pregnancy and my husband and I have decided that hell be the stay at home dad and Ill be the breadwinner for this phase of our lives. Hes had health issues which have mostly resolved and he might finish up his degree at night. 

His personality is better suited to staying at home and providing childcare, while I get really restless at home and honestly have a lot of anxiety and trauma surrounding the thought of being a stay at home parent. I work from home now which I love and we have a really great and healthy relationship. Hes super supportive and eager to be an involved stay at home dad, and feels like it would personally be more fulfilling to him than a corporate job.

We feel really confident that this is what will work best for us. Weve grown up around a lot of single income families but usually its with more traditional gender roles (dad as the breadwinner). Were from the US and were raised very religious but are now atheist. 

Im currently debating how to split up my 3 weeks PTO and 60% Paid Short term disability pay since that will be all thats available to us. 

I guess my question is, are we normal? Is it possible in the US to live this life? Has anyone gone through a similar situation?

2025-03-15,1742022860.0,Cant forgive husband for asking for a paternity test.,"TW: loss.

We got married in December 2023. A month or so before the wedding I got off birth control and got pregnant right away. When I was around 7 weeks, my husband asked for a paternity test. It absolutely crushed me, I cried for hours and ended up bleeding. The pregnancy ended a few days later.

I had 4 chemicals after and got pregnant again in August 2024. That pregnancy ended in October 2024. The paternity test hasnt been discussed since and honestly I assumed he got over it considering me tracking each ovulation, making both of us go through many tests to figure out whats wrong, etc.

Long story short- I got pregnant again in November 2024 and am now almost 17 weeks. We had guests over a few weeks ago and I was discussing crazy pregnancy dreams and one of them was giving birth to a baby with a different skin color. Everyone laughed because the discussion was lighthearted but my husband suddenly said something like and then you wonder why I want to do the test. My jaw dropped and the other woman over got very defensive for me.

He brought up the subject again a few days ago and we got in a major fight. He says he doesnt think I cheated but that since this baby stuck, maybe I got inseminated behind his back as maybe his sperm didnt work. I offered to look at all medical records of mine and reminded him of being on a shit ton of medication to sustain this pregnancy.

He stands his ground and basically belittles me and any argument I have about this being hurtful. His main point is that he is a man and has no way of knowing the baby is his.

For context:
I work from home, literally never go out unless I have a female friend over. Never spend any nights away from home and take care of 3 dogs. I physically wouldnt have time to cheat nor have I ever considered doing that. My husband also works from home and has access to all my devices/location on my phone.

I dont know what kind of advice I am looking for. I have not forgiven him for asking for the first paternity test and am simply disgusted by his behavior. 

Edit:

I wanted to thank everyone for weighing in. So much food for thought, I am glad to know I am not overreacting. I already agreed to the test as long as it is done privately as I am deeply ashamed of having to go through it. I wont divorce my husband over this but I will do everything in my power to make him seek therapy that he goes to regularly and not a couple times like he used to.

Having read through all the responses I realize it is not a me problem but rather an insecurity of his that is being projected onto me and our son.",pregnant,149.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jbpmkf/cant_forgive_husband_for_asking_for_a_paternity/

On all the ultrasounds my doctor said how she's very active and since I started feeling her kicks (started quite late with me around 25 weeks), I can also tell that she's an active one.

But for the last ~36 hours she's completely silent. I felt like 1-2 really minor movements this morning, but other than that, nothing.

I know many babies have a growth spurt at 30 weeks and that can cause them to be move less. But as a mom I'm still worried, as it's so usual for her. I tried to get her to move, moved around myself and carefully massaged my belly to get a reaction from her, but so far nothing has helped.

Should I go to the hospital? Should I wait some more? I would be very thankful for some insight and advice on this =O

UPDATE: I had a CTG done and everything seems to be okay. Of course 5 minutes after starting the CTG, baby girl started kicking.

Over time I warmed up the idea and decided Id be okay with one baby. Husband wanted three, but was glad I was open to one. We got married and after a year of trying I got pregnant with my little girl who is due in June.

Now tell me why this man is watching me suffer and is already talking about a second baby??
We had discussed right before I got pregnant that I MIGHT do two, but we dont know what pregnancy and parenthood will be like and Im not rushing to make that decision before we see what life is like with a baby.

He keeps saying the baby needs a sibling and he really wants a boy and a girl. I thought on it and decided under certain conditions I could be open to one more, definitely not three.

My conditions: 
1. We must be comfortable with the political and economical climate at the time specifically in regard to womens rights and maternal rights.

2. After breast feeding husband pays for a breast lift and tummy tuck if needed.

3. He must be okay with stopping at 2 even if we have another daughter. By stopping at 2 I mean he will get a vasectomy.

Husband is willing to accept 1-2 and says even if its another girl hed gladly stop at 2 babies so she can have a sibling. 

However, he says he will not get a vasectomy. I explained in detail how its reversible and much safer than me getting my tubes tied. He insists we can continue to use condoms and plan B as needed. I told him currently in the USA they are working to ban birth control, abortion, and plan b and we will have no fall back if I get pregnant at 40 which we both agree we wouldnt want another kid at that age.

Is this unreasonable? He says he doesnt want to mess with his downstairs and I rolled my eyes and reminded him what Im doing to my body for us to have a child.

My husband has been kind and taken good care of me through this, but I feel Ive compromised a lot and met him half way on our ideals with what our family will be like. Is a vasectomy really asking too much??

Edit: Id like to point out as there seems to be some confusion. Id never force my husband to have a vasectomy. Its simply a condition if he wants a second child which is something he wants.

I dont mind typically, since I know he struggles with sleeping. However now that Im deep in the third trimester, I need him to be available. And often during the night&he isnt.

2 weeks ago, I had very bad pains for an hour that stopped me from being able to switch sides or even get out of bed. I felt like a beached whale. I tried calling him and texting him, but his phone was on do not disturb and he didnt add me as a person to get through to him when I needed to. After about 20 mins, I was able to get up and crouch my way over to the room down the hall where I angrily woke him up. Bc hes such a disturbed sleeper, he anxiously started yelling what what what! At the top of his lungs at me. I was really upset, bc I felt when I needed him around for our baby, he wasnt there. He was angry for about ten minutes that I woke him up and was grumbling about how I get to nap during the day and he doesnt, but I wasnt having any of it. Respectfully I told him to shut his mouth and do/say nothing unless its about being there for me. Im Puerto Rican and I dont play that . Turns out the baby dropped 2 centimeters!

A couple days later, Im up in the am and hes still sleeping in. My 2 40 pound dogs are on me and Im so big I cant get them off. I try calling him, since I made myself a do not disturb contact and wouldnt you know, he put on his airplane mode! So I couldnt reach him regardless. His excuse was well I went to the other room at 6 am and I figured you were up and youd be fine. Suffice it to say, I was NOT happy. I told him he cant do this, that he needs to be reachable at all times, even if Im just downstairs. 
What if I fall? What if Im in pain again and cant move? What if the dogs wont let me get up? I said if he did it again, there would be big problems.

Now today, same thing. This time, he slept in the other room all night and the dogs are crying to be walked and Im texting/calling him..his phone is off. Im trying to yell for him..but he isnt hearing me. He also planned on waking up this am to go for a quick shake out run since hes running a half marathon tmrw. His mother is landing from Minnesota in a half hour and hes not up. I made it clear that we need to turn over the guest room for her, and need to sweep downstairs. I cleaned pretty much the whole house in prep for her yesterday. Went to Costco to do my final prep run for freezer meal prep for us, so he doesnt lose his mind cooking meals and making a mess bc I wont be able to help much, AND went to his race expo with him to pick up his bib and help him navigate it. Its his first big formal race and Ive ran multiple halfs and a marathon. So wanted to show my support for him.

Why is she coming? Bc he needs to go to a work conference for a week in Utah and the only way Id let him go is if he made sure someone was with me. Bc Im always tired and always need some help.

Am I being a brat or unreasonable to want my husband to not put his need for sleep over making himself available to me in my last month of pregnancy? He is other wise a wonderful husband during the day for the most part. Helps me clean the kitchen after I cook, will do some laundry, help clean the bathroom when I ask, walk the dogs when he can etc. He can be a little selfish from time to time with his day, but who cant? 

Im just getting so annoyed that I have to keep having this convo with him and Im debating telling his mother. Although I dont know what that will do..she tends to coddle him lol. Ive done a lot of work to get him to be less coddled lol. Ive also done a lot of work to get myself to a point where I dont just pop off on him. Being a New Yorker and Latina, thats my instinct. But he doesnt respond well to that and says Im being disrespectful and wont engage with me.

Sorry for the rant everyone. Any advice? Am I being nuts? Thanks!

Update: I popped off on him via text and told him Im telling both of our parents he keeps doing this. He said sorry and that his phone gets put on airplane mode automatically and its just habit. Well it wasnt a habit when he had it on do not disturb and we got into a fight over that right? Now that I can reach him through DND, now its a years long habit lol. I just told him that the fact that he didnt make it a priority to be cognizant of before bed shows how careless and selfish hes being.

Cut to yesterday, when Im peeing into a cup after what turns out to have been days of implantation cramps. Ive been on the pill for over half my life, so it was a total shock when I saw a positive result yesterday.

Although Weve both expressed there are a lot of things we would prefer to have happened before this step, my bf is supportive of my choice no matter what, and will rise to the occasion if I decide to continue the pregnancy.

We both have good jobs, we make good money in volatile albeit hot industries. My bf is new in his role, has some debt and has far less savings and security than me. I know people make it work with far less than us, but I dont necessarily feel like that means we should rush into this. 

Having kids has always been a well see thing, at the back of my mind, because Ive prioritized career stuff until now. I thought that Id eventually go off the pill and see what happens when I felt ready. Ive prepared myself for a future where its too late or not in the cards.

2025-03-15,1742042389.0,Anyone else have found ligament pain like this?,hi im 21(f) 24w pregnant today! and around 10:30pm last night i started to have some sharp pain in the lower left side of my belly while wandering target. It wasnt too bad but quickly progressed and by the time i got home i was bent over in pain and could barely walk. I got a warm compress and laid down as i wasnt bleeding and didnt need to use the restroom per se. It helped for a bit but around 4am it had gotten bad again to where i could barely get out of bed and if i even dared lay on my left side i was in teeth grinding pain. So my S.O. took me to the E.R and they took me to labor and delivery (this wasnt my usual doctor bc shes on maternity leave currently). They said its too early for a stress test which is fine took a urine sample and put some monitors on for a bit. Monitors all looked great and no contractions or protein in urine (not sure if they tested for any UTI or not) and sent me on my way saying its probably just baby growing. This is my first time so i was just wondering if this is normal or has been the same experience for anyone else? Should i get a second opinion? Does this seem like round ligament pain? Id also like to add the doctor on call never came into the room is that also normal?,pregnant,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jbu7xs/anyone_else_have_found_ligament_pain_like_this/

Have been type 2 diabetic for a while but my Hba1c results have been consistent of 40-45 prior to getting pregnant. I was referred to diabetes specialist early in my pregnancy and was monitored for sugar levels. My post meal blood sugar has been consistent of 8-9 and pre meal 6-7mmols. So they have decided to put me on long acting insulin twice a day. As the day goes on my blood sugar is so hard to control. They are asking for sugar levels to be below 5mmols pre meals and below 7mmols post meals. Im getting more and more depressed. Nowadays my sugar is all over the place despite watching my diet and insulin. After having an apple for breakfast would increase my sugar to over 10mmols, just one apple!! And wont drop back to normal for hours. Now Im on fast acting insulin twice a day as well as increased long acting insulin dose. I am only 11weeks pregnant and this is getting worse no matter what I do. I just wanna not eat anything nowadays because I am so scared of my blood sugars going up. My partner is keeping telling me to stop watching the continuous blood sugar monitor but thats what I do pretty much all day long, thinking omg this is so bad for the baby!.
I should be happy with the pregnancy but I am just getting more depressed about it. Ive also realised that I wont be able to have any of my cravings let alone any freaking food.

This pregnancy has been 6 months of constant GI struggles and Im so tired. I was debilitatingly nauseous until about 20 weeks, and Ive also struggled with painful gas and heartburn. I barely slept last night bc of the gastric reflux and the impossible task of finding a comfortable position. Im still eating enough but its gotten to the point where Ive almost developed a fear of food. I dont know if its my organs shifting around or what, but lately things just hurt and burn (or maybe Im just hungry I dont know.) I find myself wondering if food will just make me feel worse, or sometimes its more like apathy, like Im just so tired of needing to eat so often. But then the stomach acid gets worse if I have an empty stomach, sometimes it wakes me up at night and I have to eat a bowl of cereal. I have woken up to myself choking on my own vomit/stomach acid more than once, despite sleeping popped up on pillows. I didnt know whether to label this post as a rant or seeking advice. I feel like the only thing that will help at this point is giving birth. I wish I could fast forward to the end. I try to remind myself at least I dont have other symptoms like sciatica (yet) or GD. I dont know. Im exhausted every day even though I dont really accomplish anything. Doing a load of laundry is a big task these days. I literally do not even remember what it feels like to feel normal, kindof like when youve had a cold for weeks and you cant even remember what it feels like to breathe through your nose (which funnily enough, Ive also had constant rhinitis since October.)

Maybe this is just a rant. I alternate between tums, gasx, Pepcid, etc its like Ive tried everything and it only kindof helps. Maybe Ill ask my OB for a refill of reglan bc it feels like food just sits and rots in me and doesnt move along like its supposed to. Pregnancy is just so sucky and hard and honestly lonely. I dont have any pregnant friends and my mom and MIL and husband are all supportive but its like idk what can anyone say? I hate how my mom hasnt been pregnant in decades and has clearly forgotten (or maybe really never experienced) how truly awful it is. Everyone just wants to celebrate how magical it is and meanwhile I hate this. Im so excited to finally be a mom and have my son, but everything else about this experience is ass. I have a feeling the third trimester is just going to slowly become more and more uncomfortable until I get to the point where I just want to do nothing but lay around like Jabba the Hut until my body decides its going to attempt to expel a whole ass human from my vajayjay. My baby is the reward at the end, but even then its like out of the frying pan and into the fire with birth, breastfeeding, sleeplessness, etc.

Hello everyone!

FTM(31) here, 19 + 6. I had my regular prenatal appointment the other day, and one thing my doctor mentioned really stuck with me. She said its super important to stay active and keep my muscles in shape for the delivery. I didnt think much of it at the time, but now I'm starting to wonder what exactly she meant.

I've been going to the gym religiously (5 days a week for 1.5-2 hours) for the past 2-3 years. But since getting pregnant, I stopped going due to extreme fatigue in the first trimester. 
Now that Im starting to get my energy back, Im really struggling. Im almost always short of breath (just by existing) and cant even last 15 minutes on the stairmaster (level 6) without wheezing. 

I used to love lifting, but I cant even lift half the weight I used to pre-pregnancy. Honestly, even walking around the neighborhood feels exhausting.

What my doctor said really got me thinking and has me a bit worried, to be honest. Im wondering if anyone here can help me understand what she meant by keeping muscles in shape for delivery.

Is she referring to a specific muscle group? Or is it more about cardio? Im just feeling a bit lost on this one.

However, now that we know the gender of our baby I just want to tell people hahaha. I wouldnt be able to have a party for the next 4 weeks (parents being gone, already planned birthdays, and a wedding). 

I dont want to wait a full month to tell people, so Im looking for fun/cute ways to tell our families (at least our parents). For friends and extended family I dont mind just sending them a picture- I already have it made hahaha. Were close to our family and want to do something a bit more special.

2025-03-15,1742042904.0,CMV: Cancer Kills MillionsCutting Research Is A Disservice To Both Current and Future Generations,"**Cancer remains deadly today**\- more specifically, **pancreatic cancer** is one of the **most notorious and deadliest cancers**it should be receiving **significantly more funding, not less**. Yet, the **Senate just passed a budget slashing Department of Defense (DoD) cancer research funding by 57%, including pancreatic cancer.**

**This is personal for me.** My wife was diagnosed with **stage 4 pancreatic cancer at 35 years old while pregnant with our second child.** In a matter of weeks, our lives became a cycle of hospital visits, treatments, and fighting to survive.

Since her diagnosis, Ive met other young families facing the same battleparents in their 30s, with little kids, fighting a disease typically seen in people more than twice their age. But despite how devastating pancreatic cancer is, advancements in cancer research have offered hope that even the deadliest diseases may one day be managed as chronic conditions. Progress in other cancers proves that with the right funding and research, survival doesnt have to be out of reach.

Its hard to comprehend why one of the deadliest cancers is being deprioritized when it already lags behind in treatment advancements. Id love to hear other perspectives, but heres why these budget cuts are a major problemboth now and for the future:

**1. Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers &amp; is on the rise.**

* **Cases are rising each year**, with a growing number of diagnoses among young adults- particularly an increasing trend in women.
* **80% of patients die within a year** of diagnosis. About **12% survive five years**.
* Most cases are diagnosed at **stage 4, when its too late for a cure.**
* At **stage 4, 99 out of 100 patients do not survive beyond five years.**

**2. Fewer survivors mean fewer advocates.**

* Other cancers have **large survivor communities** that successfully push for research funding.
* **Pancreatic cancer patients rarely live long enough** to fight for change.
* This creates a **vicious cycle**: **Less advocacy  Less funding  Fewer treatments  More deaths.**

**3. Treatment progress is painfully slow.**

* Other cancers have seen **major breakthroughs in targeted therapies and immunotherapy.**
* **Pancreatic cancer is still treated with just two toxic chemo regimens**, which only extend life **by months, and many do not respond to chemo.**
* **Cutting research funding now means fewer chances to develop better treatments.**

**4. Theres a direct link between funding and survival rates.**

* The **5-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer has improved in the past five years**alongside an increase in research funding.
* **My wife is a rare beneficiary of the progress from cancer research and would be eligible to** a \*\*new FDA-approved drug (\*\*Zenocutuzumab) developed in the past few years.
* **If research funding is cut, breakthroughs like this will slow down, and more patients will be left without options.**

**5. The Senate passed a budget cutting $200 million from DoD cancer research programs, which fund high-risk, high-reward treatments.**

* **DoD programs are critical** for early-stage, high-risk research that aren't always funded elsewhere.
* Thanks to past funding, **these programs have led to breakthrough treatments**, including:
   * CAR T-cell therapy  revolutionized leukemia and lymphoma treatment.
   * XPOVIO® (Selinexor)  an FDA-approved treatment for blood cancers.
   * Personalized cancer vaccines  offering hope for hard-to-treat cancers like pancreatic.
* These life-saving treatments exist today because of **past research investments**.
* **Slashing funding now will stall progress, delay new discoveries, and limit future treatment options for deadly cancers.**

We know government funding is limited, and budget decisions are complex. But when a cancer this lethal gets its research budget suddenly cut in half, I have to ask- Whats the rationale?

# So, change my view:

* **Why shouldnt pancreatic cancer research be a much bigger funding priority?**
* **Why should we cut cancer research?**",changemyview,126.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jbudb7/cmv_cancer_kills_millionscutting_research_is_a/
2025-03-15,1742009542.0,#Saytheirnames: 18-year-old Alexis Lexi Arguello (USA 2025),"18-year-old Alexis Lexi Arguello had just moved into her own apartment and was preparing to start her adult life when Planned Parenthoods negligence killed her.

Shortly after moving out, Lexi suffered a urinary tract infection, went to get medical treatment and found out that she was pregnant. Likely not sure what her next steps should be, Lexi ended up the Fort Collins Planned Parenthood facility. She was told that she was 20 weeks pregnant. Although the facilitys website claimed that they only did abortions before 20 weeks, they scheduled Lexi for one anyway. 

During the abortion, Lexi suffered life-threatening side effects. It was obvious that she needed emergency medical treatment (which Planned Parenthood did not provide and was in no way equipped for), but the staff delayed in calling an ambulance and let her deteriorate. When they finally did call the ambulance, they tried to conceal the damage done by requesting that the ambulance not use sirens. 

This was not unusual for the facility. Witness reports from protesters and numerous dispatch records documented that the facility's frequent emergencies were  mishandled in a similar way. Life-threatening medical complications were downplayed, and time and time again Planned Parenthood tried to hide what they did to their clients. Ambulances were requested to come without sirens and were frequently directed by staff to use convoluted and indirect routes to make it less obvious that they had yet another emergency. They even had paramedics approach the back instead of using the more accessible main entrance. The ""silent siren treatment"" left Lexi suffering without help for even longer, delaying care and decreasing her chances at survival.

On February 6, the day of the abortion, Lexi's grandparents were told that she was in the emergency room. Her family hadn't even known she was pregnant, and now they arrived to find her in the hospital with doctors desperately struggling to keep her alive. She had lost so much blood that a transfusion of seven liters still didn't improve her condition, and the multiple doses of epinephrine were not enough to keep her heart beating. Her oxygen was too low and despite the best attempts of the ER, her grandparents had *seen in [Lexi's] face that it was her end.* Her blood pressure and heart rate dropped again, and she died the same day as her baby.

Lexi's devastated family wanted to find some semblance of justice for her and will take her killers to court with the help of Pro-Life organization Operation Rescue. A report of what happened to Lexi was also given to the  Colorado Committee of Health and Human Services at a hearing.

The hearing was about a bill that would require abortion facilities in Colorado to follow health and safety regulations in a similar way to medical clinics. Expert witness Dr. Keri Kasun gave testimony on what an unrestricted and unregulated Planned Parenthood had done. She confirmed that Planned Parenthood had delayed Lexis emergency treatment and stated that Lexi had been showing obvious symptoms of an amniotic fluid embolism. The risk of this complication is elevated for abortions later in pregnancy, and Lexi was even further along than she had been told at 22 weeks pregnant. (A premature baby born at this age could survive when given care.)

Amniotic fluid in the bloodstream would impair clotting abilities, making any injuries inflicted on Lexi much more dangerous. The further delays by not treating this as the emergency it was made everything worse.

In response to the bill and to the investigation of their egregious actions, the Public Affairs Manager for Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains (which oversees the oversees Fort Collins chain location) argued that they shouldnt be supervised or regulated and called the corporation a beacon of hope that would ""always fight for their patients"". But as Troy Newman from Operation Rescue put it, **This Planned Parenthood did not care if Lexi Arguello survived her complications. If they had, staff would have called an ambulance the minute she exhibited symptoms, and they would have requested lights, sirens, and any other measures that might have saved Lexis life.**

2025-03-15,1742024357.0,My person is being distant after the abortion,"hi everyone, Im 23 (f) and hes a 27 (m). In the last post I expressed how I had an abortion with the person I was seeing. I am fully recovered physically but mentally and emotionally disoriented. My person was somewhat supportive throughout the process but not exactly how I wanted him to be. He was going out a lot and speaking with other females. Me and him arent fully in a relationship but I wouldve appreciated him investing his time into me during these times. Recently he has been doing things that have been getting on my nerves. He would always plan to see me but cancel on the very last minute. He did this a good 3 times. He would reach out to me and call me to hang out but once I get ready he would flake. I feel like he was doing it on purpose and I called him out on his behaviour and decided to delete him and move on because I dont deal with men like that. He would constantly message/call apologising and would make more plans. I would forgive him naturally because of the soft spot I had for him during the pregnancy. If it wasnt for that, I wouldve disappeared. Just recently Ive seen him partying through other peoples instagram/snapchat stories and I thought it would be funny blowing up his phone. He took this to heart and told me can you stop being so clingy, I came out of a 5 year relationship she was clingy and I dont like it. I fuck with you but stop. He called me clingy in the past to but I never too it as offensive. This hurt my feelings because he said it out of anger.  I was just doing it to be annoying and he took it for a complete different meaning. It wasnt the best idea. I think he thinks I want a relationship with him because of natural loving nature. I am affection and loving to people and love to give. My plan during our time together wasnt to fall in love. However, with the excessive love bombing, he would say things like im falling in love, or when you become my mrs he would talk about marriage a lot in the beginning. Kinda scared me because I know what he was trying to do. I wanted to keep things causal but since I got pregnant I grew an attachment with him as any woman wouldve. He makes me feel bad for it and when I try to express my emotions he shuts down. Theres been loads of times he has annoyed me but I forgave him and moved on. In this case, I deleted him from social media out of hurt and few days later I tried to message on iMessage and hes giving me the silent treatment. Bear in mind we were together a week before the argument, having sex. He hasnt blocked me from iMessage but when I try to request him he ignores the request. When I did this in the past he said you can stay there and learn your lesson. When I was pregnant with him. Im not sure exactly what to do now, I want to leave one last message before I fully move on as I feel like one day sooner or later. Hes going to try to reconnect and Im going to feel emotionally disoriented again. I want to take this time to heal and fully move on without being disturbed. 



This is the message I want to leave 

I have to say I find your actions really selfish. There have been so many times when youve annoyed me, and Ive brushed it off and forgiven you. I did something to annoy you once, it wasnt the best idea, but I did it. I apologised, and Im ready to move on from it. But youre still taking it personally and saying things unprovoked.

2025-03-15,1742044392.0,feelings coming back,"Hi everyone, I have done a few post on here before. 

I found out I was pregnant beginning of this year and had my abortion a week after finding out. I felt so de attached and empty for the first week then went through a few week where I was so depressed, lost, regretful. Looking back I should have asked for help or spoken about my feeling more with my close ones. 

 Anyways, I thankfully managed to get back to normal weeks after and I kind of stopped thinking about my abortion and baby. Fast forward to now, for the past few days all I think about is my very short pregnancy, my baby and I now again feel a need to have a baby. I really thought I have recovered and moved on but maybe I havent? All I see now is babies and pregnant women. I cant stop thinking and day dreaming about pregnancy and being a mother. 

Has anyone got any advice? To clarify dates I had my abortion in January and my depressive stage lasted about 3 weeks. I was really hoping to be completely okay with it months after. I think I am scared that I could potentially go back to being in such a dark place. I look back and its super scary how unaware I was of how sad I truly was. Everyone around me would ask and try to help but I didnt accept it. I wouldnt clean, would just daydream 24/7, shower very little, not say much for weeks so it was very bad.

For context I was 22 weeks on the dot and in California for the procedure. I also went to a planned parenthood.
I found out I was pregnant a month and a half before my abortion. I have super irregular periods, had no symptoms, no bump, nothing. When I found out I figured I was not far along and had an at home medical abortion that failed. I bled but my pregnancy test was never negative after that. I then decided to tell my boyfriend and my mom and booked an appointment at pp. My first appointment they ultrasound me and I was 21 weeks. I was in shock and soon after I started to feel him kick. They let me know it would be a two day procedure. I was terrified at first. I have extremely bad medical ptsd and am beyond terrified of doctors and needles. I did not sleep at all that week, but soon the fear of needles subsided and I was just sad. I spent a week feeling him kick. I felt like a mother and was so attached. I was two weeks away from the cut off in California and I made my choice for several reasons. Since I was unknowingly pregnant I was drinking for months and months while pregnant. I am also an avid vaper. On top of that I had the medical abortion. I could not live with myself if I brought a child into this world with chronic health issues, as that was what happened to me. I was put up for adoption and had chronic medical issues and hence the medical trauma. I felt I did not have enough time to check for health issues and I did not feel comfortable bringing a child into a world where I am not financially stable. I want to give my child the world and right now I was not capable of that. Me and my partner were adopted and know what the other side of that looks like so that could never be an option for us. I was overcome with grief but I knew what the right choice was, no matter how hard it was and still is. The first day of the procedure was the scariest for me. This was when they did the fetal injection to end the heart beat and did the dilation sticks. I was sick to my stomach over that shot, but I voiced that to my doctor and she could not have handled me better. She talked to me about my life the whole way through the procedure. The injection did not hurt, it was uncomfortable because I could feel how deep the needle was. The dilation sticks also did not hurt as she numbed me. The numbing shot was probably the most uncomfortable of them all but bearable. The next day I went in for the procedure and they knocked me out stone cold. I worked myself up for a lot of nothing.

2025-03-15,1742030442.0,We both want abortion but my wife can't get over the fears from her beliefs. How can i help her?,"Hi guys,

I seriously need your help on this, and this is a long one.

We just got married, and we f'd up. We know this is our mistake and we are blaming ourselves for letting this happen.

My wife and I just found out she's pregnant a few days ago, just a month after our wedding. The scan we did yesterday didn't even show the embryo inside the uterus, so we still have time to decide what to do. It's very early. It's too early even to do a MA. Now our initial reaction and up to even now after a few days is that we are not ready to have kids. We still want to enjoy our lives and no matter how we go through the scenarios in our head and together, we can not imagine and cannot accept the reality that there will be a children in our life, at least at this time. We fully believe having a kid will more likely leave us with more suffering, and unhappiness. We've talked to great lengths about this and agree that we will be most happy and content with just each other.

But my wife is a firm believer in Buddhist teachings, and she believes that we'd be committing a major sin, akin to murder and she seems to be unable to overcome this to get the courage to make the final decision. And i don't know how to help her get through this. I believe that the decision we want to make will lead to less sufferings, and better for all parties involved. But I fear that if we decide to have an abortion, she will also not be happy and will be in tremendous mental pain and I don't know if she will even be able to heal from it.

We are also super torn due to the fact that other than our own selfish needs and the vision that we have for our life together, there's no other reason to have this abortion. We are happily in love, both our families are well off, incredibly kind, helpful to us and will be over the moon if we reveal to them about the pregnancy. There's no real financial strain to speak of to take care of the baby if we let this happen. In our culture people believe that having children is a blessing, so there's no chance of talking to anyone else in our families about this, because we will face massive judgements that will make it impossible to even speak about an abortion, so that leaves us alone to work this out.

I've tried to convince my wife that this is not a crime, and we are making this decision believing it will be best for our life together, that what ever is inside her right now is not yet a living human being, and if we make this decision with kindness in our hearts, there is no need to fear of guilt, karma or anything like that. But she is dismissing me everytime I mention it and doesnt want or unable to let go of her strong beliefs. I can see that she's in the middle of a crossroads and cannot find a way out that she can accept. She's in great pain, and I'm feeling it too.

2025-03-15,1742027301.0,Nervous! Question (and ramble) regarding GP,"So Im currently 7 weeks pregnant, if my workings out are correct.
Ive decided on an abortion as my partner and I just arent ready at this time - were looking for a bigger house as we are in a tiny house with no space for anything and we are trying to improve our quality of life.
I am an anxious person and I understand that having a baby is going to be stressful and an anxious time, and If we are going to do it at some point, I want to remove as much of that anxiety as possible. I feel having a bigger house and being in a space where we can do it at least removes some of that anxiety. I genuinely cannot see us with a baby in this space currently. 
I did come off the pill about a year ago as I didnt want to be on it anymore and at that point we sort of said just see what happens, but have been careful and used condoms where we could. Since then my anxiety/OCD has gotten worse and now its actually happened I just cant go through with it, for our sake and a childs sake.
I did go to my GP last week as I had some bleeding and cramps (which he said were normal) and the pregnancy was confirmed there and documented on my record.
I told him I was no longer on the pill and he asked me if I was keeping the pregnancy. I panicked and said yes as I was scared hed judge me when Id just said I came off the pill.
Now I have my consultation next week and Im worried that when the GP surgery finds out Ive had a termination that I will get in trouble.
I know you dont have to tell your doctor but as its on my record that Im pregnant, I dont want to turn up at a next appointment (whenever that may be) and they think Im still pregnant.
Any advice please?

2025-03-15,1742062747.0,Confused on logic and rights,"I recently did a deep dive and it left me confused. My issue is that I still don't have a genuine grasp on the logistics behind PL. I understand that PL views every fetus as a full-blown person with rights. However, rights come with the clause of not being able to take away someone else's rights no matter how small they seem in comparison. This should extend to the fetus if they are a full-blown human. That is where my logic leads me. Even if we take away the status of human with rights leaving them with just human life, the PP can still use their bodily autonomy to remove it. 


Furthermore, it's not the fetuses fighting against abortion it is born people. It's people with peens and uterus. By taking away one uterus owner's bodily autonomy you take away all bodily autonomy for current and future uterus owners. That is what having equal rights is about no matter how big or small the person is their rights are equal. If you give yourself the right to decide on someone else's behalf the same can be said in reverse. You cause a car accident and you're the perfect match for the person who got hurt you can and will be forced to save them. I understand being morally against something but you can't turn it into legislation that takes away rights from people currently alive and future generations. Jehovah's Witnesses don't believe in blood transfusions but they don't turn it into legislation because not everyone believes what they do and they would be taking away people's RTL. This is where my logic leads.  


In contrast, the PC logic seems streamlined to me. You have the right to bodily autonomy meaning you control what happens to or inside your body. If you end up pregnant and don't want to be you have the right to end that pregnancy. You end up pregnant and you want it congratulations hope you enjoy the journey. When applying the fetus has rights, not much changes. You end up pregnant and don't want to be, it's in your body and it can't take away your right to keep itself alive nor can any born person. You end up pregnant and you want it congrats on the pregnancy. It's beginning to feel more and more like your rights matter as long as there isn't a fetus involved.

2025-03-15,1742070086.0,"Do Women Have a Moral Duty to Keep Their Bodies ""Ready"" for Reproduction at All Times?","Late last year, Dr. Rebecca Gomperts (Aid Access, Women on Waves) announced results of a large clinical trial in Moldova, testing the use of a weekly low dose of mifepristone (50 mg) as a contraceptive. The results were promising, with only one pregnancy occurring within 2000 cycles. Furthermore, negative side effects were minimal, with only 4% of the participants experiencing any negative side effects (compared to a 40% negative side effect rate for conventional hormonal contraceptives). Additionally, the low-dose mifepristone was easier to use, requiring only one dose a week, and being more ""forgiving"" of variations in the time the pill is taken. And 89% of the study participants reported that they stopped menstruating while taking mifepristone as a contraceptive. (Probably most women would consider this a positive side effect.)

Because of the positive results, the trials have been expanded to the Netherlands this year. If the results continue to be positive, the plan is to apply to the European Medicines Agency for registration and market authorization to allow this weekly, low-dose mifepristone regimen as a contraceptive throughout the EU.

The method of action for mifepristone as birth control is two-fold: it reduces the rate of ovulation and it thins the endometrial lining of the uterus, making it impossible for a fertilized egg to implant.

([Source](https://msmagazine.com/2025/01/07/mifepristone-weekly-contraceptive-clinical-trials-abortion-pill-birth-control/).)

My primary question for PL supporters is this: 

* Would you have any moral or legal objections to women's use of such a contraceptive? If so, on what grounds?

Here are some secondary questions if you believe that the use of this contraceptive would be immoral:

* If a woman was taking mifepristone as described here *as a contraceptive* and informed her partner that she was doing this before they had sex, and if her partner, knowing this, decided to go ahead and have PIV sex with her, and if one of his sperm fertilized an egg but it failed to implant, whose would be the primary responsibility for the ""death"" of the fertilized egg? (Realistically, neither of them would ever know if this happened, so this is a hypothetical question.)
* *Men's* use of tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, red meat, and food high in trans fats during the months before their partners' conception is associated with higher miscarriage rates, because of these substances' impacts on sperm. ([Source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/a-mans-unhealthy-lifestyle-too-can-lead-to-his-partners-pregnancy-loss/articleshow/64072130.cms?from=mdr).)  If men engage in such unhealthy lifestyles, they are not maintaining their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction, and their choices could result in the ""death"" of a fertilized egg or even an embryo or fetus.

2025-03-14,1741988561.0,"""Pretending"" to be PL, do I pass?","I almost wanted to make this post from an anonymous account to really make this a more authentic thought experiment but felt like that would be a pushing if not trampling sub rules so doing it like this instead. I'm tagging it as ""question for PL"" as its mostly aimed there, but there are a couple things for PC as well.

**What I want to do:** 

I will present a stance and arguments as if I am PL. I will do so to the best of my ability, providing multiple of the most reasonable arguments I know of. I won't go ham on ALL details, but enough as to get the gist of the reasons behind my pretend stance. It will still be in my own ""voice"" as a debatee though, and will not use arguments that I find completely bogus (religious, consent to sex is consent to pregnancy, appeal to nature, etc). So don't hold that against me. After I will ask a few questions. Keep in mind that that the idea of the post is not necessarily in the arguments I'm presenting themselves but more in my (and by extension other PC with similar view points) ability to understand the PL view. So here goes:

**The argument:**

During fertilization, a unique entity with human DNA is created. The exact point as to when this entity should legally become a person is hard to pin point as it can change due to technology and is subject to a lot of semantic and philosophical ideas regarding personhood and law. So, my go to is to err on the side of caution and say that it should be treated as a legal person from the moment its existence is known, i.e. fertilization. This seems as the more morally sensible choice as it is better to err on the side of giving the entity more rights, that of a legal person, rather than less and risk being in the moral wrong later.

From there, since we are talking about a person with the same rights as others. This includes the right to life, which should ensure that a person is not deprived of their life, or any other right, for that matter without due process. When abortions are legal, a female person is able for any reason kill the fetus, and thus taking away their right to life without due process. Although we allow killing in self defense, even after the incident is done there would be an investigation to determine if the lethal measure was justified. This happens whenever any person is killed. Without banning abortion, this investigation would never happen, and since I think there are times in which an abortion is an unjustified use of lethal force, it should in fact occur.

So, abortion should be banned with exceptions so that it is only used in certain cases where lethal force is justified. Specifically, when there is a particular medical reason that can be named by a doctor for having the abortion outside of that from ""normal pregnancy symptoms"". This is also in part because the fetus it self has done nothing wrong, as it is incapable of having intent and acting on it. As such, it would be a moral and legal wrong for them to be killed when they have not committed a crime. Although having the female person carry the pregnancy to term may have adverse affects for them, it is a greater wrong for the law to allow a person to be killed when they could have otherwise lived.

Although forcing female people to gestate against their will may be unfortunate as a side effect, the law should err on the side of keeping persons alive in this case. Especially since unlike organ donation they are forcing inaction, rather than forcing a procedure. The female could be compensated and their struggles alleviated, weather they be social, financial or otherwise, using other government programs instead of allowing them to kill the person causing them.

It is not ideal, but it is the better status quo than persons being killed for unjustifiable reasons without due process. As a society, we should strive for the over all well being of everybody, and killing a person who has done nothing wrong goes against that. Everybody deserves a chance at life unless there are severe extenuating circumstances and in vast majority of cases, a pregnancy by it self does not constitute those.

**The questions, geared toward PL:**

1. If you are PL, if you read this without knowing I am PC, would you believe I am PL? As in, do you believe I represented  your views and arguments, or at least ones close to your stance justifiably? If no, what did I miss or what gives me away?

2. If you answered yes to 1, then lets go back to the fact that I AM vehemently, no restrictions PC. Considering I, supposedly, understand and know your arguments enough to present them in a way you find acceptable, why do you think that is?

3. Are you in response, regardless of how ""accurate"" you think my ""post"" is able to provide a counter argument as if you are PC? If you do so, do you feel like you would be able to ""pass"" as a PC? Feel free to attempt to do so as answer to this question as well.

**More questions, geared towards PC:**

1. Do you think I ""pass"" as PL? If not could you do better and where?

2. If a PL person demonstrated the same amount of understanding of the PC stance as I have demonstrated about PL, why do you think they are still PL? (This is meant to be a mirror of question 2 for the PL, sorry for the weird wording)

**Both can answer:**

If you were to guess, who do you think would do better at this ""pretend to be the other side"" exercise, PL or PC?

Our current situation is one I just don't know how to navigate. I stopped hormonal birth control a year ago. I had erroneously been told for decades I ""needed"" it for my health, so we've had to learn charting and what days are safe to avoid pregnancy. If it happens, of course I will accept God's blessing and plan, but another child is not something I am actively trying to have. There's been some learning with that and my body wasn't really lining up as it should to start so it definitely delayed some of intimacy but it's more than that.

We're averaging once a month right now and neither of us are happy about it. I think a lot of it is my fault. I don't know how to overcome this and I feel so broken. My husband is also saying that he doesn't feel wanted or that I'm excited to be with him. That's not true, I really do want to be with him in my head but when it comes time to act, it falls apart. Things I feel are ""in the way""

* Privacy - we still have to two teens at home and our bedroom is right next to theirs and our bed is LOUD, lol. We have another space we use but there is no lock so my brain is always on alert of being discovered. ...I feel this issue is eventually fixable once we can fix the room and a add door knob that locks. It isn't quite as easy as just changing hardware though, the whole room is chaos. 
* Self esteem - I've never been a very confident lover, some stuff early in our marriage took that down a few pegs more and now I'm easily 70-80lbs overweight and just feel .... gross. My husband has also put on some weight (so he has compassion to to speak) and always tells me I'm beautiful so this is in MY head for sure and he is not judging me. 
* Timing - I think because of #1 and 2 I prefer late night rendevous. I like everything being done, tucked away, not worrying about kids or chores or dogs, or whatever. My husband is the opposite, claiming he's tired, ""not at his peak"" and it isn't fair that we're always on my clock. I find I cannot relax even a little (and I'm already NOT relaxed) if it's early in the day. 
* Enjoyment (for me) - IDK if it's age, hormones (which I've had checked and are fine), my mental state or being out of practice, but reaching climax is not easy. It's reached a point of frustration for me because of course, I'd like to be able to do that sometimes. Just pumping around isn't going to work and it seems my body needs a bit more of a combination off stuff. This is a problem because of my next bullet...
* OCD is in my marriage - My husband has developed scrupolicty over the recent years and it's a third party always in the room. Within the last year there was a time where I was able to climax while were together and I thought we had a good time. The next day he was in an OCD mood, I could tell, so I asked. He was concerned we had sinned because ""he"" didn't make me climax, it had happened as result of my involvement also and was akin to self pleasure. I felt so humilated because then I had to explain why that wasn't true -- we were in the marital act together and, like I said above, a combo of actions is needed. It wouldn't have happened without us working together so to speak. He eventually seemed satisfied with that answer but I've been anxious about it ever since.
* The things I think may work for me to ""get there"" could trigger the OCD. I don't know my body anymore. I don't know what works, but I think maybe more foreplay, oral sex (for me), toys (not to be used alone, only together) could also be possible options. I'm so afraid and embarassed to even try to mention these things because I just can't face the judgement. I don't want the discussions and the research and have to prove that I can be with my husband and not be sinning.

So here I am left feeling broken and frustrated and while I want intimacy with my husband it's also beginning to feel isolating and like a chore and I hate that. I know communication is the key,  but how? I'm so shy verbally about his and a letter just seems childish. There's also the OCD. There is no other force in this world I hate talking to because once that kicks in I'm not talking to my husband, I'm talking to IT begging it to let me through.

My husband and I chose to live separately from his parents, which wasnt well received by either side.

Looking back, I realize I was naive to keep giving them chances. My in-laws come from a highly educated and affluent background, which only added to the resentment from my side of the family. My parents have always been biased, favoring my brother while placing no expectations on him. He was never given any responsibilities, yet they transferred all their property to him, completely disregarding me and my sister.

2025-03-15,1742010191.0,Can I stop eating for baby at 37W?,"TW diet and food 

TLDR because whiney and ranty, sorry : Im due any day now, does my diet still affect the babys development? 

Im normally a healthy eater and love to eat, but pregnancy has been hard on the diet front. Terrible nausea and food aversion during 1st trimester which caused weight loss, somewhat back to normal during 2nd, but the nausea returned by the 3rd along with acid reflux and indigestion, and I never experienced any cravings. Never in my life I thought that eating would become a chore. 

Ive been forcing myself to eat certain things that i particularly dont enjoy for the time being. I normally love flavorful stuff, herbs spices, etc but they all now cause nausea, now I can only have bland stuff. On top of that, Ive been trying to reduce acid and indigestion which means extra boring food, and I just try to eat to meet the minimum recommended macros because Im afraid Ill otherwise cause harm to the baby. To make up for possible lack of nutrients, Im taking so many vitamins and supplements including protein powder, and often thats enough to make me full. All in all, meal times have been stressful. 

Ive now reached 37 weeks and everything is uncomfortable but Im so thankful that things are looking good so far. My weight gain as well as the babys growth is well within the recommended range. At this point, it seems like all the major fStal developments have already happened, and Im far from malnourished. So Im wondering if it would be ok for me to eat more carelessly now for the sake of my own digestive comfort. I feel extremely heavy and exhausted all the time and no amount of calories is helping. It feels like theres no more room left in my body for any food. The baby is very energetic and moves constantly which is both comforting, psychologically and uncomfortable, physically, but I see this as a sign that hes well fed? So can I stop worrying about nutrition at this point? Obviously Im not talking about consuming alcohol and ultra processed trans fat. I just want to eat simple carbs in small amounts and be protein deficient for now until my appetite and digestive system goes back to their pre-pregnancy condition.

Well prior to my first prenatal visit, I was eating fine, I was enjoying food and adjusting to smells of food as everything started to smell weird, and I was nauseous constantly but still very much able to eat. Well at my prenatal visit, my doctor said because I was starting at 190, I have a lot of extra risk as I am obese. I know Im mostly muscle and very well proportioned, and I am the furthest thing from fat. I wear a size 10-12 sometimes smaller. Something about it hurt me a little, shortly after all I wanted was fruits, and even that was not good tasting (I normally can eat an entire watermelon no issue) then I went out with my grandmother who has always stood up for me against drs calling me obese because she watched me go from looking healthy and fit to being able to see my ribs. I told her about what the drs said and she said well I mean I can pinch an inch everywhere now and the glanced down at my bloated belly. Ever since all I want now is popsicles and water.

We had guests over a few weeks ago and I was discussing crazy pregnancy dreams and one of them was giving birth to a baby with a different skin color. Everyone laughed because the discussion was lighthearted but my husband suddenly said something like and then you wonder why I want to do the test. My jaw dropped and the other woman over got very defensive for me.

He brought up the subject again a few days ago and we got in a major fight. He says he doesnt think I cheated but that since this baby stuck, maybe I got inseminated behind his back as maybe his sperm didnt work. I offered to look at all medical records of mine and reminded him of being on a shit ton of medication to sustain this pregnancy.

He stands his ground and basically belittles me and any argument I have about this being hurtful. His main point is that he is a man and has no way of knowing the baby is his.

For context:
I work from home, literally never go out unless I have a female friend over. Never spend any nights away from home and take care of 3 dogs. I physically wouldnt have time to cheat nor have I ever considered doing that. My husband also works from home and has access to all my devices/location on my phone.

I dont know what kind of advice I am looking for. I have not forgiven him for asking for the first paternity test and am simply disgusted by his behavior. 

Edit:

I wanted to thank everyone for weighing in. So much food for thought, I am glad to know I am not overreacting. I already agreed to the test as long as it is done privately as I am deeply ashamed of having to go through it. I wont divorce my husband over this but I will do everything in my power to make him seek therapy that he goes to regularly and not a couple times like he used to.

Having read through all the responses I realize it is not a me problem but rather an insecurity of his that is being projected onto me and our son.",pregnant,149.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jbpmkf/cant_forgive_husband_for_asking_for_a_paternity/
2025-03-15,1742038168.0,"30 weeks pregnant, little to no movement in the last 36 hours","I'm 30 weeks pregnant today and so far, baby girl has been very active the entire pregnancy. On all the ultrasounds my doctor said how she's very active and since I started feeling her kicks (started quite late with me around 25 weeks), I can also tell that she's an active one.

But for the last ~36 hours she's completely silent. I felt like 1-2 really minor movements this morning, but other than that, nothing.

I know many babies have a growth spurt at 30 weeks and that can cause them to be move less. But as a mom I'm still worried, as it's so usual for her. I tried to get her to move, moved around myself and carefully massaged my belly to get a reaction from her, but so far nothing has helped.

Should I go to the hospital? Should I wait some more? I would be very thankful for some insight and advice on this =O

UPDATE: I had a CTG done and everything seems to be okay. Of course 5 minutes after starting the CTG, baby girl started kicking.

I'm currently waiting for an ultrasound to be on the save side, but the midwife said she expects me to be able to go home real soon.

Thanks to everyone for being concerned for baby girl and me!

2025-03-14,1741991016.0,"My husband wants more kids, are my conditions unreasonable?","When I met my husband I was a fence sitter. Over time I warmed up the idea and decided Id be okay with one baby. Husband wanted three, but was glad I was open to one. We got married and after a year of trying I got pregnant with my little girl who is due in June.

Now tell me why this man is watching me suffer and is already talking about a second baby??
We had discussed right before I got pregnant that I MIGHT do two, but we dont know what pregnancy and parenthood will be like and Im not rushing to make that decision before we see what life is like with a baby.

He keeps saying the baby needs a sibling and he really wants a boy and a girl. I thought on it and decided under certain conditions I could be open to one more, definitely not three.

My conditions: 
1. We must be comfortable with the political and economical climate at the time specifically in regard to womens rights and maternal rights.

2. After breast feeding husband pays for a breast lift and tummy tuck if needed.

3. He must be okay with stopping at 2 even if we have another daughter. By stopping at 2 I mean he will get a vasectomy.

Husband is willing to accept 1-2 and says even if its another girl hed gladly stop at 2 babies so she can have a sibling. 

However, he says he will not get a vasectomy. I explained in detail how its reversible and much safer than me getting my tubes tied. He insists we can continue to use condoms and plan B as needed. I told him currently in the USA they are working to ban birth control, abortion, and plan b and we will have no fall back if I get pregnant at 40 which we both agree we wouldnt want another kid at that age.

Is this unreasonable? He says he doesnt want to mess with his downstairs and I rolled my eyes and reminded him what Im doing to my body for us to have a child.

My husband has been kind and taken good care of me through this, but I feel Ive compromised a lot and met him half way on our ideals with what our family will be like. Is a vasectomy really asking too much??

Edit: Id like to point out as there seems to be some confusion. Id never force my husband to have a vasectomy. Its simply a condition if he wants a second child which is something he wants.

I was worried about breastfeeding after but my milk came in immediately and my LO and me did skin to skin as soon as I woke up, which was more or less 30-45 minutes after she was born.

2025-03-15,1742042496.0,Husband keeps putting his phone on airplane mode,"Im 36 weeks pregnant and I live at home with my husband who has a difficult time sleeping. He often goes to sleep in the guest bedroom down the hall.

I dont mind typically, since I know he struggles with sleeping. However now that Im deep in the third trimester, I need him to be available. And often during the night&he isnt.

2 weeks ago, I had very bad pains for an hour that stopped me from being able to switch sides or even get out of bed. I felt like a beached whale. I tried calling him and texting him, but his phone was on do not disturb and he didnt add me as a person to get through to him when I needed to. After about 20 mins, I was able to get up and crouch my way over to the room down the hall where I angrily woke him up. Bc hes such a disturbed sleeper, he anxiously started yelling what what what! At the top of his lungs at me. I was really upset, bc I felt when I needed him around for our baby, he wasnt there. He was angry for about ten minutes that I woke him up and was grumbling about how I get to nap during the day and he doesnt, but I wasnt having any of it. Respectfully I told him to shut his mouth and do/say nothing unless its about being there for me. Im Puerto Rican and I dont play that . Turns out the baby dropped 2 centimeters!

A couple days later, Im up in the am and hes still sleeping in. My 2 40 pound dogs are on me and Im so big I cant get them off. I try calling him, since I made myself a do not disturb contact and wouldnt you know, he put on his airplane mode! So I couldnt reach him regardless. His excuse was well I went to the other room at 6 am and I figured you were up and youd be fine. Suffice it to say, I was NOT happy. I told him he cant do this, that he needs to be reachable at all times, even if Im just downstairs. 
What if I fall? What if Im in pain again and cant move? What if the dogs wont let me get up? I said if he did it again, there would be big problems.

Now today, same thing. This time, he slept in the other room all night and the dogs are crying to be walked and Im texting/calling him..his phone is off. Im trying to yell for him..but he isnt hearing me. He also planned on waking up this am to go for a quick shake out run since hes running a half marathon tmrw. His mother is landing from Minnesota in a half hour and hes not up. I made it clear that we need to turn over the guest room for her, and need to sweep downstairs. I cleaned pretty much the whole house in prep for her yesterday. Went to Costco to do my final prep run for freezer meal prep for us, so he doesnt lose his mind cooking meals and making a mess bc I wont be able to help much, AND went to his race expo with him to pick up his bib and help him navigate it. Its his first big formal race and Ive ran multiple halfs and a marathon. So wanted to show my support for him.

Why is she coming? Bc he needs to go to a work conference for a week in Utah and the only way Id let him go is if he made sure someone was with me. Bc Im always tired and always need some help.

Am I being a brat or unreasonable to want my husband to not put his need for sleep over making himself available to me in my last month of pregnancy? He is other wise a wonderful husband during the day for the most part. Helps me clean the kitchen after I cook, will do some laundry, help clean the bathroom when I ask, walk the dogs when he can etc. He can be a little selfish from time to time with his day, but who cant? 

Im just getting so annoyed that I have to keep having this convo with him and Im debating telling his mother. Although I dont know what that will do..she tends to coddle him lol. Ive done a lot of work to get him to be less coddled lol. Ive also done a lot of work to get myself to a point where I dont just pop off on him. Being a New Yorker and Latina, thats my instinct. But he doesnt respond well to that and says Im being disrespectful and wont engage with me.

Sorry for the rant everyone. Any advice? Am I being nuts? Thanks!

Update: I popped off on him via text and told him Im telling both of our parents he keeps doing this. He said sorry and that his phone gets put on airplane mode automatically and its just habit. Well it wasnt a habit when he had it on do not disturb and we got into a fight over that right? Now that I can reach him through DND, now its a years long habit lol. I just told him that the fact that he didnt make it a priority to be cognizant of before bed shows how careless and selfish hes being.  I def got tough and rude with him and he told me to stop a few times, which promptly got met with a stfu >7<ý@. Now hes up and trying to check and see if Im ok.

Ive been on the pill for over half my life, so it was a total shock when I saw a positive result yesterday.

Although Weve both expressed there are a lot of things we would prefer to have happened before this step, my bf is supportive of my choice no matter what, and will rise to the occasion if I decide to continue the pregnancy.

We both have good jobs, we make good money in volatile albeit hot industries. My bf is new in his role, has some debt and has far less savings and security than me. I know people make it work with far less than us, but I dont necessarily feel like that means we should rush into this. 

Having kids has always been a well see thing, at the back of my mind, because Ive prioritized career stuff until now.

FTM currently 35 weeks, and Im starting to overthink labor and delivery. I know every  experience is different, but Id love to hear from those whove been through itwhat actually helped you make the process easier?

Any advice on:

- Pain management (with or without an epidural)

- Positions or techniques that helped during labor

- Things you wish you brought to the hospital

- Mental preparation or ways to stay calm

- Anything you did during pregnancy to prepare your body

Have been type 2 diabetic for a while but my Hba1c results have been consistent of 40-45 prior to getting pregnant. I was referred to diabetes specialist early in my pregnancy and was monitored for sugar levels. My post meal blood sugar has been consistent of 8-9 and pre meal 6-7mmols. So they have decided to put me on long acting insulin twice a day. As the day goes on my blood sugar is so hard to control. They are asking for sugar levels to be below 5mmols pre meals and below 7mmols post meals. Im getting more and more depressed. Nowadays my sugar is all over the place despite watching my diet and insulin. After having an apple for breakfast would increase my sugar to over 10mmols, just one apple!! And wont drop back to normal for hours. Now Im on fast acting insulin twice a day as well as increased long acting insulin dose. I am only 11weeks pregnant and this is getting worse no matter what I do. I just wanna not eat anything nowadays because I am so scared of my blood sugars going up. My partner is keeping telling me to stop watching the continuous blood sugar monitor but thats what I do pretty much all day long, thinking omg this is so bad for the baby!.
I should be happy with the pregnancy but I am just getting more depressed about it. Ive also realised that I wont be able to have any of my cravings let alone any freaking food. I hate myself for having diabetes and dont want to eat anything. Also the fact that its just gonna get worse not better makes me more depressed just thinking about it.

2025-03-14,1741996531.0,3rd trimester rant,"Im planning on asking my OB about this at my next appointment, but Im 28 weeks and struggling. This pregnancy has been 6 months of constant GI struggles and Im so tired. I was debilitatingly nauseous until about 20 weeks, and Ive also struggled with painful gas and heartburn. I barely slept last night bc of the gastric reflux and the impossible task of finding a comfortable position. Im still eating enough but its gotten to the point where Ive almost developed a fear of food. I dont know if its my organs shifting around or what, but lately things just hurt and burn (or maybe Im just hungry I dont know.) I find myself wondering if food will just make me feel worse, or sometimes its more like apathy, like Im just so tired of needing to eat so often. But then the stomach acid gets worse if I have an empty stomach, sometimes it wakes me up at night and I have to eat a bowl of cereal. I have woken up to myself choking on my own vomit/stomach acid more than once, despite sleeping popped up on pillows. I didnt know whether to label this post as a rant or seeking advice. I feel like the only thing that will help at this point is giving birth. I wish I could fast forward to the end. I try to remind myself at least I dont have other symptoms like sciatica (yet) or GD. I dont know. Im exhausted every day even though I dont really accomplish anything. Doing a load of laundry is a big task these days. I literally do not even remember what it feels like to feel normal, kindof like when youve had a cold for weeks and you cant even remember what it feels like to breathe through your nose (which funnily enough, Ive also had constant rhinitis since October.)

Maybe this is just a rant. I alternate between tums, gasx, Pepcid, etc its like Ive tried everything and it only kindof helps. Maybe Ill ask my OB for a refill of reglan bc it feels like food just sits and rots in me and doesnt move along like its supposed to. Pregnancy is just so sucky and hard and honestly lonely. I dont have any pregnant friends and my mom and MIL and husband are all supportive but its like idk what can anyone say? I hate how my mom hasnt been pregnant in decades and has clearly forgotten (or maybe really never experienced) how truly awful it is. Everyone just wants to celebrate how magical it is and meanwhile I hate this. Im so excited to finally be a mom and have my son, but everything else about this experience is ass. I have a feeling the third trimester is just going to slowly become more and more uncomfortable until I get to the point where I just want to do nothing but lay around like Jabba the Hut until my body decides its going to attempt to expel a whole ass human from my vajayjay. My baby is the reward at the end, but even then its like out of the frying pan and into the fire with birth, breastfeeding, sleeplessness, etc.

Im 42 and conceived naturally after 2 failed rounds of IVF. I am currently 11w3d and I thought Id be a little more relaxed by now. From the beginning I thought this might end in loss because its my first pregnancy and based on my age, I didnt want to get too excited. 

I got lucky and my annual exam ended up being my first appointment at 5w. All was looking good. Then I had some spotting so of course I worried. No cramps, no flow so I tried to remain calm. 

My next appt was at 8w and I was convinced Id get bad news, all was good, strong heartbeat and we got to see the little bean>. Then I had more frequent spotting sometimes bleeding so more freaking out. It seemed like the longest two weeks waiting for my next appointment.

Next up, 10w and NIPT. Baby was looking good, strong heartbeat. Then came waiting for the results so more worry. Results came in 2 days ago: low risk baby girl=. I felt brief excitement for 2 days and then last night, more spotting/bleeding and some light cramping. So Im back to worrying.

My next appt is 3/17 for NT screening and I am emotionally exhausted. Part of my worry is my doctor hasnt found a reason for the bleeding.

2025-03-15,1742034035.0,"I want to improve relationship with my mom, but I cant stand her","Im 26 weeks pregnant and my mom insists on staying at my house during postpartum to take care of me, but she hasnt cared much for me during pregnancy and I seriously cannot stand her, even though I love her very much.

Until now, she has come to visit me once, never texted or asked me about my conditions, said she would visit us but cancelled last minute twice. 

Today is my parents wedding anniversary, she told us to come for dinner but I said we would come over for lunch because I have other things. I came and she said she didnt know I would not be staying for dinner. I told her I had work that I cant miss, Ive been very stressed out about work that I woke up at 2am and cant fall back to sleep for several nights already. I was exhausted, the house was small there is no room for me to rest, so while my parents took afternoon nap in their room, I had to lay on the floor in the living room. I ended up leaving around 3pm because I didnt want to torture myself.

My husband and I are very private person, we dont like having other people in our house so we purposefully only built two rooms, one for home office and the other our bedroom. When my mom told me she would come over to stay, I told her we didnt have a room, and she said why built such a badly designed house. She wanted me to do postpartum confinement for at least 2 weeks without touching water (meaning no shower), and I said no. The argue only ended with my dads intervention telling my mom her way was very old-fashioned and not suitable anymore. I told her Ill let her know if I needed help, but Im not making any arrangements for now.

The thing is, I know my mom cares and her love language is food, but she talks too loudly and too much, and her obsession with food drives me nuts. Whenever I talked to her about other things, she brushed them off. I had so much childhood trauma with my mom I cant bring myself to be open with her anymore.

When I was a kid, I told my mom my hair was falling out but she didnt care until I was almost bald. She laughed at my handmade gift to her and told me it was ugly. In uni I asked her to bring home (southeast asia) some pottery and glass I made and treasured very much, she left them at my cousins house in the US. When I asked to move out because I didnt feel comfortable living together, she threatened to cut ties because she was afraid of what others might say. She never said sorry to me once. Honestly, I dont think my feelings matter much to her. Shes controlling, and loves my brother because he would listen to her demands all the time. I have stopped telling her anything going on with me because she would brush them off, telling me we earn a lot of money so those are not really problems.

Im afraid my relationship with my mom will affect the relationship with my child, and I really want to have a loving, open relationship with my mom. I know its two-way, Im also part of the problem as Im too independent and like spending time alone. I feel more at ease to be with my cats than with my mom because I dont have to talk or entertain them. I know my mom will be a great help once baby comes, but I cant bring myself to ask her anything. Im afraid Id be too annoyed at her and make myself even more tired.

Hello everyone!

FTM(31) here, 19 + 6. I had my regular prenatal appointment the other day, and one thing my doctor mentioned really stuck with me. She said its super important to stay active and keep my muscles in shape for the delivery. I didnt think much of it at the time, but now I'm starting to wonder what exactly she meant.

I've been going to the gym religiously (5 days a week for 1.5-2 hours) for the past 2-3 years. But since getting pregnant, I stopped going due to extreme fatigue in the first trimester. 
Now that Im starting to get my energy back, Im really struggling. Im almost always short of breath (just by existing) and cant even last 15 minutes on the stairmaster (level 6) without wheezing. 

I used to love lifting, but I cant even lift half the weight I used to pre-pregnancy. Honestly, even walking around the neighborhood feels exhausting.

What my doctor said really got me thinking and has me a bit worried, to be honest. Im wondering if anyone here can help me understand what she meant by keeping muscles in shape for delivery.

Is she referring to a specific muscle group? Or is it more about cardio? Im just feeling a bit lost on this one.

2025-03-15,1742007283.0,35 weeks. Need advice. What do I do after a non-fault car accident leaves our family with no income?,"Hello. I am located in SC, United States. Throwaway due to us still being in legal proceedings with the Car accident. I am currently 35 weeks pregnant with our first, and I am high risk. My husband got into a car crash last week that has left him with a broken leg in two spots. The car was totaled, and the other party was cited as 100% at fault. We have no idea how he is alive but I am unbelievably amazed that he is. His recovery is looking like 4-6 weeks, with no surgery. This will be confirmed at various follow ups so unfortunately until he heals, I do not have an exact timeframe. I am grateful that this does not currently look like a long term injury.

We have done the correct things regarding the accident, such as reaching out to our insurance, the other driver's insurance, and a family friend's recommended personal injury lawyer. I am following the advice of my lawyer regarding the car accident, but I am looking for advice regarding how to pay our bills in the meantime. Due to the nature of his injury, this is looking like it will be a relatively long settlement period while he recovers. We expect a reasonable amount at the end of this.

At this time, we have one remaining vehicle that is paid off and are not worried about getting a second anytime soon. The car involved in the accident was in my father's name and he will be receiving the car settlement, not us. The injury settlement will be what I am going to receive at the end of this. We live paycheck to paycheck and due to my high risk pregnancy, I am currently off work. Prior to the accident, at the end of our bills we have $80 for gas, and my father/WIC are covering our groceries. My husband barely makes just enough for us not to be eligible for food stamps. I do not have any disability pay or paid maternity leave. My husband just started a new job two months ago and is not eligible for disability or paid leave. Following the accident, my husband is unable to complete training at this time and is going to be placed on unpaid administrative leave until he is cleared by his doctors to continue training. I understand that in the settlement this will all be paid for due to the lost wages, but in the meantime, we are trying to not have our house foreclosed or our lights turned off, or bills go to collections. I have tried applying for a personal loan and we were denied due to lack of income. He has two small credit cards, and I have one small credit card (total credit borrowed less than $2,000). They are all at about 90% of max. We were denied for all credit increases due to paying the minimum amount and not more. We have been denied opening new lines of credit due to lack of income at this time. We are as prepared as we can be for the baby, and I plan to return to work as soon as I am able.

We do not have any friends or family with the funds to pay our mortgage and bills in the meantime while we wait for the settlement money.  Our church paid our mortgage and electric bill in January when I was put on unpaid maternity leave. I am trying to reach out to other churches and associations in our area but unfortunately most of the population is struggling in this economy and there's only so much money to go around. We have filed a deferment for the mortgage but it is not looking like they will give us more than a month. We already did a loan modification in January which was screwed over by an increase in escrow anyway. We are not eligible for another modification anytime soon. Our monthly expenses are not that high. Total is less than $3,500 a month for mortgage, bills, and utilities.

At this point, I feel like my only option is go fund me and pray. Our community has been wonderful, neighbors and friends helping me with chores, etc. so it's really just figuring out how to pay our bills in the meantime.

Can anyone please give me advice on how to proceed? Is there an option I'm missing? To reiterate, I am not asking anyone here for money, just advice. I'm terrified of being foreclosed on with a newborn because of this car accident.",pregnant,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jbllja/35_weeks_need_advice_what_do_i_do_after_a/

2025-03-15,1742048405.0,Unusual? morning sickness advice please.,"I am 23 and one month along with my first child. Unplanned pregnancy so I have had no time to research into or preparation when it comes to morning sickness. So I am asking for advice on specifically foods or activities that may help with both the stomach issues and the overall feeling horrible (dizziness, brainfog, exhaustion).

My morning sickness changes daily with what sets me off and I am unsure if this is unusually but the only thing I can consistantly keep down are dairy products. I usually feel sick in the stomach from when I wake up to 12pm and from 4:30/5pm until I sleep which can be countered with some snacking I have noticed. I haven't been throwing up much, but I haven't been able to eat much in one sitting and constantly feel like I am starving. I've been taking vitamins to help and they have greatly reduced the sickness in the mornings, but I am still constantly hungry. I am considering getting nuts and dried fruits to snack on throughout the day. Is this a sign that I am not getting enough nutrition at the moment? I do feel extremely physically exhausted on a daily basis in the evenings. Is there a recommended eating pattern that would help deal with the hunger? Thank you for any input.

2025-03-15,1742040682.0,Telling the difference between pregnancy-caused nausea/vomiting and eating food that didnt agree with you,"Hey all! Just found out I am pregnant a few days ago. I think I am 4 weeks along after checking a few calculators online (first day of last period was Feb 10).  The symptoms I noticed about a week ago was sore boobs which only seem to be getting worse, and some tiredness here and there. Yesterday though, an hour after I ate my lunch, I got a sudden bout of nausea and thought I was going to vomit immediately. It came out of nowhere and honestly scared me and my body went into a flight/fight reaction, where suddenly I felt sick all over and thankfully didn't puke but I had to poop a few times and felt nauseous for many hours.  I also felt lightheaded the majority of the day but I assume it's because I didn't eat nearly as much as I normally would and I expelled everything out the other end lol.

I eventually got hungry again, about 5 hours later, and ate a handful of walnuts which made my stomach hurt.  Then about 2 hours after that I had a quesadilla and fiesta potatoes from Taco Bell which went down well, but I got a slight tummy ache again and just felt ""bleh"" and lethargic.  Woke up today feeling much better but had another bathroom trip which was rather unpleasant.

I do have IBS and have always had issues here and there with my stomach. I of course always worried that I would be absolutely terrible when pregnant and now I'm freaking out a bit because it's SO early in the pregnancy that I shouldn't be nauseous from it already... But anyways, long story short, how can you tell when your sickness is from pregnancy OR when its from eating something your body didn't agree with?",pregnant,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jbtqem/telling_the_difference_between_pregnancycaused/

Currently 12+4 with our < post IVF loss at 12+5 March of last year. As you can imagine Im struggling mentally and emotionally as the sense of loss never really goes away but of course grateful for this spontaneous pregnancy after TTC for 4yrs.

But feel like Im functioning more than I have been in the last three months. My nausea has kept me out of work several days in the last few weeks so the almost sudden absence is really sending me for a loop.

I calculated my due date based on the first day of my last period, which was February 10. This would make my due date November 17. Then I got to thinking about my first pregnancy from 2021. Ive been consistently tracking my periods and the exact days where we did the deed since like 2016. I went back in the app to July and August of 2021 to see that my period was July 13-16, 2021, my supposed ovulation was July 14 (although I think its actually around July 16, being that I regularly have a 30 day cycle), and we did the deed July 24 and 26. If I were to calculate the due date based on the first day of my last period before I got pregnant (July 13), then the due date wouldve been April 19, 2022. I think I found out I was pregnant in like September though and soon after had an appointment where I was told my due date was May 21, 2022. I remember having to wait at least 2 more weeks for another appointment so I could get an ultrasound. It was at that appointment that I was told my new due date was May 17, 2022. At the time, I didnt know how they determined how far along you were. I just thought I got pregnant in August and that was that. Now it just has me really curious how there was a whole month difference. I know when they calculate it based on the first day of your last period that its not 100% accurate, but to be 4 weeks off is weird.

2025-03-15,1741998336.0,C-section rescheduled day of,"Today was supposed to have been my scheduled C-section. I (32 female 39 weeks and 5 days pregnant) had everything, literally everything, I could think of done, cleaned, prepped and figured out. So of course the day prior my fiancé comes down with an illness. Mind you I've been extremely hyper vigilant on avoiding any illnesses this entire pregnancy. I wear disposable gloves and use Lysol wipes at the grocery store, avoid crowded events and stay away from people who are experiencing any symptoms. 

Yesterday morning my fiancé woke me up to tell me he was ill so I had him take a 3 panel at home test for COVID19 and flu A&amp;B. Everything came back negative. I noticed that my throat was starting to feel sore as well so I called the labor&amp;delivery department where my csection was scheduled as well as my obgyn. They both said to just come regardless and even though my fiancé is sick with fever, chills, head/body aches, congestion and runny nose he could still come too. Of course we would need to take proper precautions though. 

I continued to finish my preparations last night with the hope that this was just the RSV, that I'm vaccinated from, currently going around but still i woke up this morning with extreme anxiety. Looking at my s.o. hardly able to stand I asked him to take another test. He did and tested positive for flu A. Mind you my fiancé isn't the greatest at self awareness. He has been constantly coughing into his hands and touching everything. The pets, grabbing silverware, light switches, door knobs and cabinets. I'm trying to stay as calm as possible repeatedly disinfecting things behind him and kindly suggesting that he frequently washes his hands, coughs into his shirt and avoids touching everything. 

I felt like my fate had already been sealed and I was about to have a C-section then come down with the flu with a newborn and have no one to help with the baby and C-section recovery. My fiancé is like the typical manly man that gets taken out by illnesses. Nothing against him but I know I wouldn't be able to rely on him to safely take care of the baby while avoiding transmission. So I called labor/delivery and they said they'd have my obgyn call me. He never did so I prepared to go in anyway and once I got there they had him on the phone and he said let's just go ahead and reschedule.

I was initially at first relieved because I can't handle the thought of doing all of this alone while sick. The thought of a newborn with the flu feels like a nightmare. Now I'm reading that pregnancy with the flu can cause still births. I am just so torn because my only concern is our baby and I worry if I made the wrong choice. I'm not sure exactly what I'm asking for on here. Maybe some shared experiences and advice. I wouldn't be able to live with myself if anything happened to my baby girl. My anxiety has been dragging me all over the place. Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read and respond to this.

Just wanna throw my symptoms out there and see if anyone has had anything similar happen to them.

Im 34+5 weeks and for the last few days I haven't been able to sleep for more than an hour or two at a time because it feels like every muscle from collar bone to crotch tightens up to the point of pain bad enough to wake me up. I can strech and it'll relieve the symptoms for a little while, but it comes right back within an hour. Sleeping propped up at a 45 degree angle helps, but I think that's only because it keeps the little one from being pushed into my chest as hard and squishing my organs when the muscles tighten.

A week ago I did go into preterm labor for about 4 hours. Luckily it stopped on its own before any big problems occurred, but my ob did say that I am not 1 cm dilated and about 50% effaced. The little one did drop into my pelvis and had a lot of pressure for about a day and a half until they came back up on their own. I do have medication available to me now to stop contractions if this happens again for the next 2 weeks where it'll be ok if I go into early labor.

I don't know if this has something to do with the early labor or just normal growing pains or what's going on. Just know that suddenly no matter what I do I can't keep my muscles from feeling like they're slowly strangling my insides. Fetal movement is good, lots of strong kicks like always. Honestly a bit too strong since I've got 3 bruised ribs.. and doc says heartbeat sounds strong and normal rhythm.

But ya, if anyone has any clues or advise on how to get the muscles to stop being a pain.. everywhere.. I'd appreciate t!",pregnant,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jc0onc/abdominal_paintension/

ER detected no intrauterine pregnancy with an HCG in the 200s. Also detected 3.6cm cyst on left ovary. They diagnosed me with a miscarriage.

Cut to calling the nurse to let her know the diagnosis and schedule a follow up. I had my follow up yesterday on 3/12. They gave me an ultrasound and again, no signs of intrauterine pregnancy. Cyst had shrunk slightly to 3.2cm. They took my blood again and I got the results today.

HCG is now 513. Completely baffled by this, I call the OB and speak with the nurse. She says she suspects that I am still pregnant just very early and thats why nothing is showing on US.

I am so confused. I was pregnant, not pregnant and pregnant again within 6 days. I had already started grieving the loss. Now Im in a state of depressive shock until I know for sure.

2025-03-16,1742137126.0,What's wrong with women getting 'unsafe' abortions if abortion is banned?,"I see alot of pro-choicers and people who are 'personally' pro-life but publicly pro-choice bring up this point like they are trying to evoke some kind of pity,sadness or concern for the mothers who will be getting illegal unsafe abortions.

As a pro-lifer who thinks abortion is murder and mothers who commit abortions are murderers, I fail to see the point here. This may sound hard-hearted and unsympathetic but I couldn't give a hoot if any adverse complications arise when a woman is getting an illegal unsafe abortion. They are trying to murder a child for fk sake 

Similarly, if an armed mugger,murderer, rapist or pedophile gets harmed while committing such atrocity, I couldn't give a two-bit shit.

2025-03-15,1742071655.0,Question about a pro-choice argument,"I am currently debating someone about abortion, and they keep using the 'personhood' argument.

They will usually say a human gets their rights when they are born, because that is when they become a human. I responded to them saying that it is a highly subjective term and shouldn't be used to say whether someone deserves rights or not, since it is not only dangerous to them but can also become dangerous for us becayse anyone can do it to anyone. They said that they believe someone is a person when they are also aware (which is not observable, btw), and that the unborn are therefore not persons.

I always struggle with this one, since it's such a subjective term differing between different people, everyone will give a different answer.

2025-03-15,1742065517.0,"Apparently the possibility that a child would grow up (then die) a non-Christian, then spend eternity in Hell justifies murdering them before birth","Heres the argument: 


I assume most Christians here hold the view that God does not judge a non believing fetus the same as a fully grown non believing adult. No matter what for the fetus, he will send the fetus to heaven for eternity with him because the fetus doesn't have the capacity to have a belief in anything. So by this logic, abortion guarantees the soul of the fetus to spend eternity in the kingdom of heaven with God.... If you let the fetus grow up to be a human, statistically they have a large chance of Rejecting God and spending eternity in Hell.... Is it worth it to gamble on this? If you abort the fetus you ensure that soul is sent to heaven. It's the moral thing to do. Some of you might say ""thou shall not kill"", well even if it is, isn't this the ultimate sacrifice for ensuring eternal bliss of another soul in heaven? By this logic abortion is the absolute most moral thing you can do under the sun according to Christianity.

I cried at first when I saw it but my brother came to reassure me and told me I was doing the right thing for both the embryo and myself.

Im a 31-year-old woman and have been with my husband for 13 years. Together, we have a beautiful 3-year-old son. My first birth was nothing short of traumatizinghe was diagnosed with a kidney condition at 20 weeks, which led to an induction and ultimately an emergency C-section. After his birth, he had to undergo a series of nuclear tests, adding to the trauma. It took me two years and a lot of therapy to begin healing from that experience.

A little over a year ago, we decided to try for a second baby. It took us a year to conceivea year filled with heartbreak and hurdlesbut finally, we had our miracle. Then, at 20 weeks, we received devastating news: our baby was diagnosed with a congenital heart condition, including moderate aortic stenosis and a ventricular septal defect. The uncertainty is crushing.

Although weve been told that our son will most likely live a normal life, we cant help but consider the possibility of termination. The stress, the mental load, and the potential trauma feel overwhelming, and I dont know if I have the strength to go through it again.

Im now 21 weeks. Time feels like its slipping away. I feel him moving, my belly is growing, and yet I find myself questioning everything.

My (now) ex-boyfriend pressured me into having an abortion, making me feel like I had no choice. The concerns over the extent of his forcefulness &amp; controlling behaviour were also logged at the time by the medical professionals at the abortion clinic. Two days later, he dumped me over text, told me he never wants to have children with me completely cut me off, and within two weeks, he was posting date night pictures with someone new, as I lay in bed still recovering physically &amp; mentally. He has a narcissistic mother that also blocked me on the day of my surgery and never even acknowledged that I was pregnant. Its just them two, his father is not around &amp; has a completely new family. Its like they both erased me and my baby overnight.

The worst part isI regret it. I didnt want to go through with it, but I was made to feel like I had no choice. I would cancel consultations until he noticed I was doing that so he would start driving me there, I couldnt take the preparation pill for hours but the amount of force I had received, it made me feel like I would be in serious danger if I kept my baby. Now, Im left with this overwhelming grief that I dont know how to process. I feel like a part of me is missing, and I dont know if Ill ever forgive myself. Its hard to function normally when the pain is this heavy. Its been 3 weeks now and I havent eaten a full meal since the day before the surgery, Im signed off work due to my mental health, I dont have any friends as he completely isolated me, and I get no more than 3 hours sleep a night. 

What makes this even harder is that just 10 days before I conceived, I was told I was infertile. Because of my PCOS, one of my ovaries no longer works, and I was led to believe that getting pregnant naturally would be nearly impossible for me. So when I found out I was pregnant, it felt like a miraclesomething I never thought Id get the chance to experience. And now, knowing that I was forced into giving that up, without knowing if Ill ever get another chance, makes the grief even more unbearable.

I (28)F and my husband (26)M have been married 5 years and have 2 kids already. A boy and a girl. I never wanted more than that. ESPECIALLY with how difficult our youngest has been. I was supposed to be on the birth control patch but I messed up and put it on 48 hours late and now have found myself unexpectedly pregnant. When I first found out I went to my husband and told him bawling my eyes out because we both know we did not want this and let him bring up the option of abortion because we are in Texas, US. At first he seemed on board although, did seem a little emotional about it. (He is very emotional and I am very logical) I went ahead and bought the abortion pull online and had it shipped to a fedex pick-up in New Mexico (only an hour from me ) and picked it up without communicating that to him, but of course wasnt going to take the pills before talking to him one more time. I brought it up again and he said he had talked to a therapist (I had encouraged him to and sent him several therapists in our network) and said when he talked to the therapist, he said that it seemed we both wanted different things but he was just leaving it up to me so that way it didnt ruin our marriage. This is not how I thought he felt at ALL. I knew he felt a little guilt, but I thought he was onboard with my decision. Anyways, the therapist suggested we both write a pros and cons list for having the baby and sit down together and make sure this is a joint decision, which I agree with, but I worry this isnt going to get us anywhere closer to a joint decision and this is obviously a time sensitive situation. So far, my pros list has like 5 very superficial items and my cons list is 30 items long and very valid reasons. I guess I just need someone else to talk to about this. 

A few of my cons:
-I am so close to a huge promotion at my job and a 50% pay raise and I think being pregnant would stop this progression 
-I am the main caregiver for our kids now and I already feel overwhelmed as is. 
-We would have to put a 6 week old in daycare and Ive never had to leave an infant that soon and it gives me anxiety
-We would need a bigger car and I would want a bigger house and camper to accommodate 
-Our youngest is not potty trained and having to change 2 sets of diapers just stresses me out. 
-The world is built for families of 4
-We would be outnumbered. Which brings up a whole other list of things. 
-The world and economy is shit. (Need I say more?)
- We have no village
I could go on and on and on , but I wont 

My 5 pros which carry no real weight in my mind:
-A bigger family at holidays
-Someone for our youngest to play with
-My friend and I would be pregnant together
-I could have the natural birth I wanted with our 2nd
-I could get my tubes tied after since we will reach our deductible
-Special treatment when pregnant =

Ive been steadfast in my decision from the start so I havent been emotional really throughout this process, Im just feeling relieved as I type this. Here is my experience with the medication for anyone whos worried!

Last night around 7pm I took the step 1 pill (mifepristone) by mouth and had no side effects. 

I woke up this morning with my usual morning sickness and then i had my morning coffee and doom scrolled tiktok for a few hours before getting ready to take step 2. I prepped by setting up my bed with my heating pad and a towel to protect my mattress, love island on the tv, snacks, meds within reach and water. I live alone so was alone for the process but kept my best friend updated throughout the day. Heres how my day today went:

11:30: clonazepam x1, ate toast and jam

12:00: Tylenol 3 x2
Naproxen x1

12:25 800 mg misoprostol vaginally

1:05- severe cramps, nausea, light headed, shaky, lasted 15 min

1:15 clonazepam x1

2:00 ate chicken nuggies &amp; smoothie

2:45 mild cramping &amp; heavy bleeding begins (small clot)

3:20 cramping getting worse 

3:45 2 large clots, lots of blood in toilet when went to go pee

4:20 2 more large clots, cramps getting worse again
 
4:25 Tylenol 3 x2

5:00-7:45 nap time. mild- mod cramping

7:45- Carrie scene while walking to bathroom after nap. One more large clot. Straight into shower. 

8:00- all cleaned up, mild cramping, still heavily bleeding

9:00- eat late supper, feeling mostly normal, very mild cramping, moderate-heavy bleeding

Honestly, the worst part was the really bad cramps around 1pm. Passed like 5 med-large clots altogether and used maybe 7 pads over the course of the day. Dont be afraid if you are!

Let me start with the first oral pill, mifepristone. I knew from the start that this first pill doesnt do much only slight cramps. After I took it maybe towards the end of the day i started experiencing on and off cramps which were very mild and made me a little nauseous, thats it, but not to the point where I wanted to throw up. I do have to say though that the next day I was bleeding already and I didnt even take misoprostol yet. Which I called the doctor and they said that its normal. Now the second pill which I took today when I was already bleeding from the first, misoprostol, I had to insert 4 internally. This one I was really scared for after hearing other peoples experiences saying it was 11/10 pain, etc etc. Let me tell you my experience.

2025-03-16,1742105868.0,MA at 7 weeks. Stopped bleeding today but what to expect next?,"So I am 28 years old, tested positive a few weeks ago and I was having a very healthy pregnancy, the doctor was happy and prescribed me folic acid and everything to continue the pregnancy until I disclosed that I want to terminate because, iJUST GOT MARRIED AMTWO MONTHS AGO!!! So I took the four miso pills vaginally last to last Saturday, and major cramps happened that day itself, passed a tennis ball sized clot and then tissue like stuff spotting for the next 7/8 days and then just stopped bleeding altogether but then day before yesterday i suddenly bled fresh blood and it was quite a lot almost felt like a period, no pain at all tho. 

I woke up today and its completely gone, like I tried to examine my cervical area, not at all bleeding. 

Do I consider this the end of the most uncomfortable experience of my life or this is just click bait for me to open my pad or have sex and act normal and my uterus surprises me something more awful? Will my periods return on time ? ( during my pregnancy I also got diagnosed with mild pcod)

Just had my first appointment to get dilated for my surgical abortion. Everything went well and Im able to continue with the abortion tomorrow. I stopped smoking a day before my scheduled appointment to get dilated. I thought maybe I could hit my vape before my appointment tomorrow which is at 11 AM, right now it is currently 7:19 for me. Would it be safe for me to smoke just a little bit before my appointment tomorrow? This appointment is to get the baby removed completely. I have low iron so Im at higher risk for needing a blood transfusion, but I think the only risk that comes along with smoking before the surgery is infection, but the doctor told me he will be giving me medicine to try to prevent that along with that he will be giving me medicine to help prevent loss of blood and help me with the iron issues.  I know this sounds terrible, but Im very stressed and I just really wanna smoke. Is it possible that I could without ruining the surgery or getting hurt?

2025-03-16,1742127558.0,Post MA and I feel hopeless,"(Throwaway account! Sorry, english is not my first language, pardon my grammar lapses)

Had a successful MA yesterday. Process only took me 4 hours to pass my precious angel. The procedure didnt go very well and heres the context.

March 14,2025
- I asked my live-in partner if he can take a day off this weekend to help me with my MA. I explained and said sorry in advance if I ever sound demanding as this procedure is mentally and emotionally draining for me. He said yes, assured me that he would be there. I already took mifepristone at 11:30am. 
- Later that afternoon, he asked permission if he can report work to fulfill his duties as it was critical for him to decline (hes an engineer and I cant really understand how does his workload looks like on a daily basis) that he also needs to work on Sunday for rotational work. I also told him that I may not understand his workload, but I understand that he needs to focus at work, but the stress hes giving me is just unnecessary.
- As a response, I lashed out on him, voicing out my frustrations and he took it negatively and broke up with me as I was affecting his career.
- At that time, I was really disappointed that he cant fulfill his words.
- ADDITIONAL CONTEXT: 2024 I was at the hospital cause Im about to give birth to our first born, he left me at the hospital for the same reason.. WORK.. that they are understaffed and no one will shoulder his workload. My doctors and midwife even spoke to him to straighten up his priorities as Im in active labor, that they cant proceed with anything unless theres a guardian that can accommodate them if something happens to me, but ofc, as usual, he was really firm with his decision to prioritize his work over his partner. Im new in town and I barely even have friends to ask help with.

March 15 
- at 11:30am already took the first dose of misoprostol and it all came back to me, the abandonment, the neglect from the day I gave birth, and after childbirth, the paternity leave I gave him was just useless, later on I figure out that he didnt disclosed that I was pregnant to his company. And yes, he left me with child care after birth with minimal help as he told me, as he ALWAYS told me that I need to be self-sufficient. And yesterday, it all crashed down on me. The same reason I had to deal with from the times I asked him for help. So I decided to handle things on my own. I went through the process scared, anxious, paranoid and alone.
- He went to work in the morning and went home around 12pm to offer help but my mind is already dysregulated and already disconnected that I refused to receive any help from him. Then he got angry and started shouting and even throwing things inside our room while im actively going through the abortion. Even threatened to hit me but shouted in front of my face instead.
- I was still firm that Im not gonna accept any help from him, the amount of stress that hes giving me is just not helping. So I was left with my 1 year old, crying, doing tantrums while my body is shaking, painfully going through the process. He didnt even bother with child care so I can focus with my process. Idk, hes trying to help but not really helping, shit made me really confused at this point, but oh well, what can I do? I just continued the process with all the emotions that Im feeling. No one to talk to, just trying to seek comfort while watching tiktok clips. 
- 3pm, I was able to finish the procedure and was crying and breaking down for couple of hours after seeing my angel. 
- The next few hours I started bleeding heavily, passing big clots after and cramping so bad that ibuprofen didnt even help to minimize the pain. Fell asleep but woke up around 3am with severe cramping, passed another big clots until dawn. 
- I woke at 3am and I thought It was already done but he even messaged my only friend whos been there for me but was not pro-abortion, telling her that she should check on me as I was doing the abortion. Now my only friend already FOd me as it was against her ethics to tolerate this. I felt betrayed for what he did and disappointed with everything that I just want to die. My grief was beyond comprehension, I just dont understand anything anymore at this point.

March 16
- Post MA today, Im still somewhat heavily bleeding 1 1/2 pads within 2 hours, but I decided to go to the mall as if nothing happened, hoping I can pass out there and die, I was just nauseous and dizzy but still able to walk and even bought groceries for me and my 1 year old baby. 
- I broke down after eating, almost had a panic attack while lining up to the cashier cause I saw a pregnant woman being held by her husband/partner

I just got home and I broke down again. I cant do this anymore, this is just too much for me. My body is trembling and I feel cold. I just dont know how to push forward from here.

i have not bled but only been passing tissue since the MA, and i was able to get them to do an ultrasound when i went to the ER for the concussion. they consulted with my OB/GYN and i have 1.3cm thick tissue on my endometrium retained from the pregnancy. i was given the option of waiting to see if it passes with subsequent periods, but im terrified of retained tissue leading to future pregnancy complications. tried misoprostol again for the tissue and absolutely nothing happened, so they scheduled me for D+E later this week. i am so tired and just want to get to the point where i can cope with the grief and depression and work towards having my life back. 

i made the decision to have the procedure because of this, but im also really do not want to have to go through another traumatic medical experience, especially without support. i have read a lot of others stories about waiting for this tissue to pass for months without any luck. is going through with the D+E worth it? should i wait? please feel free to share experiences in either direction, hope everyone is getting by out there d",abortion,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jcbhj1/rpoc_2_weeks_after_ma_at_105_weeks_de/

2025-03-16,1742130618.0,Cramping on left side 3 weeks after medical abortion,"Hey guys, I need some advice. About 3 weeks ago I had a medical abortion at 6 weeks pregnant. I ordered the pills online, it's my second abortion so I didn't go to a doctor, also just for the simple fact that I have state insurance and it's very hard to find a provider around me that covers the cost of an abortion.

But for the last 2 days, I have had cramping that is specifically on my left side. It radiates to my hip and I can feel it in my leg, butt and back as well. It feels just a tad bit more intense than my normal period cramps but nothing crazy. My bleeding has started lightening up over the past day or 2, but this cramping has just been so consistent over the past 2 days that I'm starting to worry. Last night I decided to take a pregnancy test just to make sure that my hcg levels were going down, but it still came back very positive.

I can say that I did see the sac come out when I had my abortion, so I know that my body dispelled SOMETHING. All of my bleeding was normal and everything had passed. I guess I'm just concerned about a potential ectopic pregnancy? I've never experienced one so I'm not sure what that pain would feel like. The cramping just feels very odd, especially for how directed it is in my left side and it's not just a general cramping feeling in my uterus.

Just figured i'd post on here and ask if anyone has experienced anything like this before taking myself over to the ER to get an ultrasound done....",abortion,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jcl3oj/cramping_on_left_side_3_weeks_after_medical/
2025-03-16,1742146227.0,SA with no Sedation - Positive Experience,"This was not my first abortion, but it was my first surgical. I opted to not do medical this time as I have health anxiety (and GAD), so I disliked the self-regulating aspect of the MA. I also liked the idea of it being over in 10 minutes vs the MAs 10+ hours. I chose to do no sedation honestly because the idea of even partial sedation kind of freaks me out. I liked the idea of being somewhat in control, and I felt like I wouldnt have that with sedation. This is just me though and my weird health anxiety brain. 

Before the procedure: The day of the procedure, my bf and I went to the clinic around 1:15 (apt was 1:30). I was taken for a vaginal ultrasound around 1:45 and they said I was 5wks3days.  Then, I was given an antibiotic and my bp was taken. I then had to wait for the Dr to arrive for about 45 more minutes. 

I was moved to the room and told to undress from the waist down and put a pad in my underwear (for after). I was hoping they would give me an ibuprofen or something before the procedure, but they didnt. Then, I laid down and waited for the nurse to come and set up the instruments. She did and then the other nurses and Dr came in. They were all very chatty and friendly. We kept talking about my decision to not have the sedation: they were telling me that if at any point I changed my mind, we could do it, but I didnt feel pressured at all. I feel like I have a decent pain tolerance after having a chronic ankle injury and heavy periods with a lot of cramps. I was less worried about the pain since it wouldnt last for that long, I was more just nervous/anxious about the whole thing. 

The procedure: At first, the Dr. examined me to check the placement of my cervix (I think). Then, he put in the speculum, and it was cold and honestly kinda pinched, but it didnt hurt really. Then, he gave me the lidocaine injections to my cervix, and they didnt really hurt. I remember them all asking and I said, I just kinda feel my cervix, and they laughed and said that was a good sign. Then, he started with the dilation rod and that hurt! It wasnt 10/10 pain but definitely uncomfortable pain that caused me to kind of kick my legs a little (lol). It definitely hurt every time it happened - it happened maybe 5 times during the procedure and almost felt like he was just moving something around in there. It was maybe 8-9/10 pain but only lasted for 5-10 seconds each time. I just closed my eyes and breathed while trying not to tense up, although I definitely made faces (not really noises other than comments like oh ouch or yeah that kind of hurts). The suction didnt really feel like anything, it was a little uncomfortable and maybe a little painful (2/10) but not as bad as my normal period cramps and not nearly as bad as the other feeling I described above. The whole thing last probably 5-7 minutes and the part after the lidocaine shots (which felt like the real beginning) lasted only about 2-3 minutes. I didnt see anything that came out as I was either looking at the ceiling, had my eyes closed, or was talking to one of the nurses next to my head. During the procedure they also were checking my uterus with an ultrasound on my abdomen, but that I kind of just zoned out and forgot that was happening. They pulled all of the stuff out and it was definitely relieving, not painful at all. It really just felt like I could relax everything down there finally. Then, they said good job and left other than one of the nurses. She brought me my underwear and pants and put them on for me (this part was so awkward lol). I think its the normal procedure if someone gets sedation, but I feel like I could have just done it myself& it was just so awkward lol. I ended up just asking to do it myself and she let me.

After: I felt weak and was cramping a lot after. Other stories I read said that once the procedure was done, all the pain went away, but that wasnt the case for me. I had pretty bad cramps for maybe 5 minutes. Then, they lessened to mild cramps. They had me sit in an inside waiting room and took my blood pressure twice. They gave me a pack of crackers and water, which I took, and also offered an ibuprofen that I declined. I sat there for probably 20 minutes total and then they said I could leave. In total, I was there from 1:15-3:00. 

Now, as Im writing this it had been about 22 hours and the cramping has become almost none. I had mild cramps for maybe an hour after, but I took naproxen and havent had any since. I did wake up nauseous today, which I didnt have during the pregnancy, but it went away fairly quickly. 

Overall, I would probably do the same route again, without the sedation and all, but I would take a naproxen before the procedure since all I had was the lidocaine. I hope that this helps at least one person in feeling better before!! If you have any questions, please ask! Also, Im sorry if this was not well written, Im writing on my phone lol.

2025-03-16,1742147691.0,Medication Abortion - Positive Experience,"Hi all, 25F here, US/North Carolina. I was absolutely terrified to go through with my MA this weekend so I wanted to share my experience in case it helps someone else. 

Some background, I was 5-6 weeks pregnant for my abortion and I am prone to extremely bad menstrual cramps for my normal period, which made me really scared to go through with the misoprostol. In North Carolina, you have to go through a consent appointment 72 hours prior to the abortion, so I did that at a local clinic. It was a bizarre experience where I had an ultrasound, light bloodwork, and counseling (if you can even call it that). 

On Friday I took the mifepristone at the clinic in a room of like 6 other women. I had little to no side effects from the mifepristone, other than emotional effects. I took Naproxen instead of Ibuprofen because it works much better for me, so I started that on Friday. Yesterday I took two rounds of misoprostol (8 pills total). Dissolving them in my mouth was definitely unpleasant but not a huge deal, made my gums kind of sore after. I started cramping within 20-30 minutes and started bleeding about an hour after starting the pills. I took Naproxen an hour before starting the first round and Zofran right before. I prepped with period underwear (dont skip out on this part!) and overnight pads. I had 2 heating pads, one that wraps around my back and one for the front. 

Like I mentioned, my menstrual cramps are horrific normally (Ive taken toradol injections at urgent care for the pain before) and my periods are very heavy (8 days long) so I was worried my abortion pain would be proportional to that, but luckily with the Naproxen and heating pads, it was comparable to a bad period for me. You should definitely prepare to be as sedentary as possible (I found that moving around made the cramps and nausea worse). If you can have someone with you to support you and get anything you need, its a huge help. 

I passed the pregnancy about 4 hours after the first round which is about when I started the second round of misoprostol. I made sure to eat something and drink electrolyte drinks before the second round because the nausea and stomach cramps were pretty bad. I had some diarrhea as well. By the second round of misoprostol, I had already passed the largest clots and it was just a lot of bleeding by that point. I used about 5-6 overnight pads the first night. Make sure you have a heating pad with an automatic timer/shut off so you can go to sleep with it on. I made sure to take another Naproxen before I went to bed at about midnight. Unfortunately, for some reason 12am-3am was kind of the worst of the pain for me, idk if it was the stomach cramps and nausea or what but that was the hardest part, but still not the worst pain Ive ever experienced. By the time I woke up in the morning, the worst of it was over and I didnt need any pain meds anymore. Im still having mild cramping today but overall it had not been NEARLY as bad as I expected. I expected to be crying all night from the pain, but I never got to that point. Here are the items I found most helpful:
- Period underwear
- Thick overnight pads
- Electrolyte drinks (hydration will help your nausea) 
- Wrap around heating pad with automatic shut off timer
- Zofran/anti nausea medication and pain medication that works best for you
- Popsicles and Italian ices (the cold helped my nausea)
- Applesauce and rice (to be able to take the meds) 
- All the distraction items you might need. Video games, books, movies chosen beforehand, etc. 

My DMs are open if anyone has questions about my experience or needs to vent. This was one of the hardest things Ive ever had to go through so Im happy to help you through it.

Flash forward to September, I got a copper IUD. And immediately felt insanely emotional. Crying spells daily and PMDD that was debilitating. My poor partner, I was an absolute menace. Ive never experienced anger and sadness quite like the six months I had the IUD. 

After things hit a breaking point and I didnt feel my body was adjusting, I got the IUD removed and switched to YAZ. Which is the only birth control Ive found that is supposed to help with PMDD. 

I am three weeks into yaz and while I feel better, I do NOT feel as good as I did pre pregnancy. The week before my period still feels like hell. I am irritable, angry, and cannot stop crying. Ive never experienced PMS like this pre pregnancy. 

Is this a normal response post abortion? Will this get better with time? Is there anything I can do to make the week before my period not absolute hell for everyone involved? ",abortion,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jcfozs/pmdd_post_abortion_tn_usa/

2025-03-15,1742070086.0,"Do Women Have a Moral Duty to Keep Their Bodies ""Ready"" for Reproduction at All Times?","Late last year, Dr. Rebecca Gomperts (Aid Access, Women on Waves) announced results of a large clinical trial in Moldova, testing the use of a weekly low dose of mifepristone (50 mg) as a contraceptive. The results were promising, with only one pregnancy occurring within 2000 cycles. Furthermore, negative side effects were minimal, with only 4% of the participants experiencing any negative side effects (compared to a 40% negative side effect rate for conventional hormonal contraceptives). Additionally, the low-dose mifepristone was easier to use, requiring only one dose a week, and being more ""forgiving"" of variations in the time the pill is taken. And 89% of the study participants reported that they stopped menstruating while taking mifepristone as a contraceptive. (Probably most women would consider this a positive side effect.)

Because of the positive results, the trials have been expanded to the Netherlands this year. If the results continue to be positive, the plan is to apply to the European Medicines Agency for registration and market authorization to allow this weekly, low-dose mifepristone regimen as a contraceptive throughout the EU.

The method of action for mifepristone as birth control is two-fold: it reduces the rate of ovulation and it thins the endometrial lining of the uterus, making it impossible for a fertilized egg to implant.

([Source](https://msmagazine.com/2025/01/07/mifepristone-weekly-contraceptive-clinical-trials-abortion-pill-birth-control/).)

My primary question for PL supporters is this: 

* Would you have any moral or legal objections to women's use of such a contraceptive? If so, on what grounds?

Here are some secondary questions if you believe that the use of this contraceptive would be immoral:

* If a woman was taking mifepristone as described here *as a contraceptive* and informed her partner that she was doing this before they had sex, and if her partner, knowing this, decided to go ahead and have PIV sex with her, and if one of his sperm fertilized an egg but it failed to implant, whose would be the primary responsibility for the ""death"" of the fertilized egg? (Realistically, neither of them would ever know if this happened, so this is a hypothetical question.)
* *Men's* use of tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, red meat, and food high in trans fats during the months before their partners' conception is associated with higher miscarriage rates, because of these substances' impacts on sperm. ([Source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/a-mans-unhealthy-lifestyle-too-can-lead-to-his-partners-pregnancy-loss/articleshow/64072130.cms?from=mdr).)  If men engage in such unhealthy lifestyles, they are not maintaining their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction, and their choices could result in the ""death"" of a fertilized egg or even an embryo or fetus. Do they have a moral duty to maintain their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction by refraining from such lifestyle choices?",Abortiondebate,56.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jc47ep/do_women_have_a_moral_duty_to_keep_their_bodies/

1. Moral worth is based on current capacity for sentience, as **only sentient beings can experience harm**.

2. A pre-sentient fetus **lacks the ability to experience harm** and has no present interests.

3. Forcing a sentient person to remain pregnant **imposes significant physical, psychological, and emotional harm**.

4. Future potential does not create present moral worth; moral status depends on actual characteristics, **not hypothetical ones**.

5. When a **moral conflict** arises, the entity capable of experiencing harm (the pregnant person) has **greater moral weight** than a non-sentient fetus.

Conclusion:

Before fetal sentience, abortion is morally justified because **there is no meaningful harm to the fetus**, while forcing pregnancy **significantly harms a sentient person**.

2025-03-16,1742088474.0,Who's responsible for a bleached reef?,"This is a thought experiment I'm using to demonstrate an issue I have with the idea of individual responsibility, which is commonly invoked in debates over abortion.

Imagine you're snorkeling on what was once a lively shallow patch reef shortly after a marine heatwave and, depressingly, discover that all of the stony coral bleached and died. 100% mortality. All of the corals died and the system shifted to one dominated by macroalgae and octocorals.

You're upset by this turn of events. You're frustrated, angry, sad. 

You wonder who, if anyone is responsible. YIH wants them to be held accountable.

To determine who's responsible, we have to consider what factors led to the reef bleaching. So, what are those factors?

--

One major and obvious factor was the heatwave. Why was the temperature so high? It was probably in part due to global warming caused by anthropogenic release of greenhouse gases. Further, it was probably exacerbated by [El Niño](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o%E2%80%93Southern_Oscillation).

That's not the whole story, however. For one, local factors such as influence the temperature. These local factors are involved and are influenced by global weather phenomena. 

Further, other factors contribute to bleaching, such as salinity, solar irradiance, disease, and exposure to pollutants. These factors are influenced by a wide array of natural and anthropogenic phenomena. For instance, turbidity and cloud cover impacst how much sunlight corals are exposed to. Some sunscreens are harmful pollutants. Precipitation influences salinity.

Further, various factors, from the abundance of herbivores to the amount of nutrients in the water, influence algal growth and subsequently influence whether or not the system shifts to one dominated by macroalgae.  Those factors are also influenced by a wide array of natural and anthropogenic phenomena.  Fishing can influence herbivore abundance. Pathogens can decimate populations of some herbivores, as happened to longspine urchins in Florida. Nutrients from agriculture can run off into aquatic systems and stimulate algae growth.

Also, the ability of a reef to recover after a mortality event is influenced by the density of surviving corals.  If the density of the surving corals is low, their population growth will be low due to the [Allee effect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allee_effect) and they'll be outcompeted by organisms such as macroalgae.

Finally, some corals are more resistant to stressors such as temperature for reasons that are poorly understood.

--

So, who's ""responsible?"" Who can er hold accountable for the bleached reef? 

You might not think any person or small group is, at least not in the sense of ""ultimate: or ""dole"" responsibility.

You can't isolate any one person's actions and say ""this is ultimately why this event occurred."" The reef bleached because of a complex array of interrelated processes, some of which occur on a global scale.  The actions of some small amount of humans weren't the only factor. 

--

I think many events that we try to hold people responsible for are like this. They occur because of a complex array of interrelated processes. No one person is ultimately responsible for them. Of course, this is the case! The event isn't a part of an isolated system that only involves a singular person.",Abortiondebate,30.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jcage8/whos_responsible_for_a_bleached_reef/

I even considered myself a satanist when I was 13-14 years old, and as I got older I started learning about religions of the world and when I got to Christianity I fell in love with Catholic culture and the church and the practices and I realized back in November of 2024 that I wanted to be Catholic. I went to church and it felt like a home away from home, I started praying the rosary and when I learned about Carlo Acutis I was sucked in further, and I follow in his was with my extreme love for Mary and Jesus.

Well, my mother was not as happy about it as I was, she doesn't like the church or Christianity and leans to universal Unitarianism and the more and more I've talked about Catholicism with my mother the more she's argued against it.

2025-03-16,1742136501.0,How do I tell my boyfriend I want our daughter to have my last name?,"A little bit of context - I (26F) am 8 months pregnant with my (32M) boyfriends daughter. 

We unexpectedly got pregnant and found out in August of last year. Once we found out, my entire world changed. I obviously stopped drinking, vaping, caffeine, everything to ensure I had a healthy, safe pregnancy (which thankfully I have). My boyfriend struggled with the change. For months, I found him sneaking alcohol behind my back, hiding drinking from me, and being completely irresponsible. We had the talk many times before that if this happened abortion was not an option (for me, I am 100% pro choice though). Here is why: 

I have worked very hard to become financially stable and independent. I purchased my first home at 24 which we live in together (everything is in my name). I have a full time job that I have been at for 3 years with great benefits (including the health insurance that has gotten us 100% through this pregnancy). I work from home and have the ability to keep my daughter home with me once she is born, and 3 months of paid maternity leave. I put money in savings every month and only have a car payment/mortgage. So in my mind, and what we agreed to before, was if I got pregnant we would keep the baby. 

Over the last 8 months, our relationship has really struggled. He has not been supportive or helped me in any way. I have purchased everything for the baby (almost $4,000 worth), paid for our maternity photos, scheduled all the doctors appointments, cooked my own meals, did the nursery alone. All while he was drinking (which he finally says he stopped, I dont have the energy to care anymore), and smoking weed every single day (he still does this). 

I have cried to him many times about the emotional state of our relationship and how I need him at this time but nothing has changed. There is no intimacy in our relationship, and he only cares about himself and the image of having a girlfriend/baby on the way. He owns his own business and does not have health insurance so he contributes nothing (and has NO plan to) for our daughters health. It will all fall on me. 

Im writing to ask, how do I tell him I want her to have my last name? I am terrified our relationship wont last this way, Ive asked about counseling but of course I would have to pay for it. He gets offended when I ask. But I am doing everything for our child. He just feels we are lucky that we wont have to pay for childcare and that Ill breastfeed to save money on formula. But those are still sacrifices I am making, because I will be a full time employee (and bread winner) who is also taking care of our child. 

If our relationship does turn around and we decide to get married one day, it would be much easier to change her last name than to ever get his permission to change it

Resembling the effects of eugenics, it reflects a societal bias against disabilities, effectively ""weeding out"" a specific genetic trait.

Eugenics per wikipedia: is a set of beliefs and practices that aim to improve the genetic quality of a human population -&gt;This in itself seems a good ""improving genetic quality of the human population""

Eugenics is stigmatized due to the racist evils of Nazi Germany, but it's goal of improving a populations health and other desirable characteristics is not evil in it's self.

It will obviously need to be controlled but once we can select and screen fetuses and embryos for positive characteristics such as good health (e.g. not having mental or physical illnesses), long life, physical strength, intelligence that will improve society we should and it can be argued it would be immoral to the next generation not to do so e.g. we are treating them poorly

Once genetic selection becomes  a societal norm similar to  how immunizing a child is expected today, It will be seem negligent to opt out, much like skipping vaccines is viewed now.

  
TLDR:  
Downs syndrome screening is eugenics "" a set of beliefs and practices that aim to improve the genetic quality of a human population"".

Im writing to ask, how do I tell him I want her to have my last name? I am terrified our relationship wont last this way, Ive asked about counseling but of course I would have to pay for it. He gets offended when I ask. But I am doing everything for our child. He just feels we are lucky that we wont have to pay for childcare and that Ill breastfeed to save money on formula. But those are still sacrifices I am making, because I will be a full time employee (and bread winner) who is also taking care of our child. 

If our relationship does turn around and we decide to get married one day, it would be much easier to change her last name than to ever get his permission to change it

This may sound hard-hearted and unsympathetic but I couldn't give a hoot if any adverse complications arise when a woman is getting an illegal unsafe abortion.

Similarly, if an armed mugger,murderer, rapist or pedophile gets harmed while committing such atrocity, I couldn't give a two-bit shit.

I assume most Christians here hold the view that God does not judge a non believing fetus the same as a fully grown non believing adult. No matter what for the fetus, he will send the fetus to heaven for eternity with him because the fetus doesn't have the capacity to have a belief in anything. So by this logic, abortion guarantees the soul of the fetus to spend eternity in the kingdom of heaven with God.... If you let the fetus grow up to be a human, statistically they have a large chance of Rejecting God and spending eternity in Hell.... Is it worth it to gamble on this? If you abort the fetus you ensure that soul is sent to heaven. It's the moral thing to do. Some of you might say ""thou shall not kill"", well even if it is, isn't this the ultimate sacrifice for ensuring eternal bliss of another soul in heaven? By this logic abortion is the absolute most moral thing you can do under the sun according to Christianity.

2025-03-15,1742070086.0,"Do Women Have a Moral Duty to Keep Their Bodies ""Ready"" for Reproduction at All Times?","Late last year, Dr. Rebecca Gomperts (Aid Access, Women on Waves) announced results of a large clinical trial in Moldova, testing the use of a weekly low dose of mifepristone (50 mg) as a contraceptive. The results were promising, with only one pregnancy occurring within 2000 cycles. Furthermore, negative side effects were minimal, with only 4% of the participants experiencing any negative side effects (compared to a 40% negative side effect rate for conventional hormonal contraceptives). Additionally, the low-dose mifepristone was easier to use, requiring only one dose a week, and being more ""forgiving"" of variations in the time the pill is taken. And 89% of the study participants reported that they stopped menstruating while taking mifepristone as a contraceptive. (Probably most women would consider this a positive side effect.)

Because of the positive results, the trials have been expanded to the Netherlands this year. If the results continue to be positive, the plan is to apply to the European Medicines Agency for registration and market authorization to allow this weekly, low-dose mifepristone regimen as a contraceptive throughout the EU.

The method of action for mifepristone as birth control is two-fold: it reduces the rate of ovulation and it thins the endometrial lining of the uterus, making it impossible for a fertilized egg to implant.

([Source](https://msmagazine.com/2025/01/07/mifepristone-weekly-contraceptive-clinical-trials-abortion-pill-birth-control/).)

My primary question for PL supporters is this: 

* Would you have any moral or legal objections to women's use of such a contraceptive? If so, on what grounds?

Here are some secondary questions if you believe that the use of this contraceptive would be immoral:

* If a woman was taking mifepristone as described here *as a contraceptive* and informed her partner that she was doing this before they had sex, and if her partner, knowing this, decided to go ahead and have PIV sex with her, and if one of his sperm fertilized an egg but it failed to implant, whose would be the primary responsibility for the ""death"" of the fertilized egg? (Realistically, neither of them would ever know if this happened, so this is a hypothetical question.)
* *Men's* use of tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, red meat, and food high in trans fats during the months before their partners' conception is associated with higher miscarriage rates, because of these substances' impacts on sperm. ([Source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/a-mans-unhealthy-lifestyle-too-can-lead-to-his-partners-pregnancy-loss/articleshow/64072130.cms?from=mdr).)  If men engage in such unhealthy lifestyles, they are not maintaining their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction, and their choices could result in the ""death"" of a fertilized egg or even an embryo or fetus. Do they have a moral duty to maintain their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction by refraining from such lifestyle choices?",Abortiondebate,56.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jc47ep/do_women_have_a_moral_duty_to_keep_their_bodies/
2025-03-16,1742136839.0,Abortion is Absolutely Justified,"Premises:

1. Moral worth is based on current capacity for sentience, as **only sentient beings can experience harm**.

2. A pre-sentient fetus **lacks the ability to experience harm** and has no present interests.

3. Forcing a sentient person to remain pregnant **imposes significant physical, psychological, and emotional harm**.

4. Future potential does not create present moral worth; moral status depends on actual characteristics, **not hypothetical ones**.

5. When a **moral conflict** arises, the entity capable of experiencing harm (the pregnant person) has **greater moral weight** than a non-sentient fetus.

Conclusion:

Before fetal sentience, abortion is morally justified because **there is no meaningful harm to the fetus**, while forcing pregnancy **significantly harms a sentient person**.

Resembling the effects of eugenics, it reflects a societal bias against disabilities, effectively ""weeding out"" a specific genetic trait.

Eugenics per wikipedia: is a set of beliefs and practices that aim to improve the genetic quality of a human population -&gt;This in itself seems a good ""improving genetic quality of the human population""

Eugenics is stigmatized due to the racist evils of Nazi Germany, but it's goal of improving a populations health and other desirable characteristics is not evil in it's self.

It will obviously need to be controlled but once we can select and screen fetuses and embryos for positive characteristics such as good health (e.g. not having mental or physical illnesses), long life, physical strength, intelligence that will improve society we should and it can be argued it would be immoral to the next generation not to do so e.g. we are treating them poorly

Once genetic selection becomes  a societal norm similar to  how immunizing a child is expected today, It will be seem negligent to opt out, much like skipping vaccines is viewed now.

  
TLDR:  
Downs syndrome screening is eugenics "" a set of beliefs and practices that aim to improve the genetic quality of a human population"".

Im a 31-year-old woman and have been with my husband for 13 years. Together, we have a beautiful 3-year-old son. My first birth was nothing short of traumatizinghe was diagnosed with a kidney condition at 20 weeks, which led to an induction and ultimately an emergency C-section. After his birth, he had to undergo a series of nuclear tests, adding to the trauma. It took me two years and a lot of therapy to begin healing from that experience.

A little over a year ago, we decided to try for a second baby. It took us a year to conceivea year filled with heartbreak and hurdlesbut finally, we had our miracle. Then, at 20 weeks, we received devastating news: our baby was diagnosed with a congenital heart condition, including moderate aortic stenosis and a ventricular septal defect. The uncertainty is crushing.

Although weve been told that our son will most likely live a normal life, we cant help but consider the possibility of termination. The stress, the mental load, and the potential trauma feel overwhelming, and I dont know if I have the strength to go through it again.

Im now 21 weeks. Time feels like its slipping away. I feel him moving, my belly is growing, and yet I find myself questioning everything.

I (28)F and my husband (26)M have been married 5 years and have 2 kids already. A boy and a girl. I never wanted more than that. ESPECIALLY with how difficult our youngest has been. I was supposed to be on the birth control patch but I messed up and put it on 48 hours late and now have found myself unexpectedly pregnant. When I first found out I went to my husband and told him bawling my eyes out because we both know we did not want this and let him bring up the option of abortion because we are in Texas, US. At first he seemed on board although, did seem a little emotional about it. (He is very emotional and I am very logical) I went ahead and bought the abortion pull online and had it shipped to a fedex pick-up in New Mexico (only an hour from me ) and picked it up without communicating that to him, but of course wasnt going to take the pills before talking to him one more time. I brought it up again and he said he had talked to a therapist (I had encouraged him to and sent him several therapists in our network) and said when he talked to the therapist, he said that it seemed we both wanted different things but he was just leaving it up to me so that way it didnt ruin our marriage. This is not how I thought he felt at ALL. I knew he felt a little guilt, but I thought he was onboard with my decision. Anyways, the therapist suggested we both write a pros and cons list for having the baby and sit down together and make sure this is a joint decision, which I agree with, but I worry this isnt going to get us anywhere closer to a joint decision and this is obviously a time sensitive situation. So far, my pros list has like 5 very superficial items and my cons list is 30 items long and very valid reasons. I guess I just need someone else to talk to about this. 

A few of my cons:
-I am so close to a huge promotion at my job and a 50% pay raise and I think being pregnant would stop this progression 
-I am the main caregiver for our kids now and I already feel overwhelmed as is. 
-We would have to put a 6 week old in daycare and Ive never had to leave an infant that soon and it gives me anxiety
-We would need a bigger car and I would want a bigger house and camper to accommodate 
-Our youngest is not potty trained and having to change 2 sets of diapers just stresses me out. 
-The world is built for families of 4
-We would be outnumbered. Which brings up a whole other list of things. 
-The world and economy is shit. (Need I say more?)
- We have no village
I could go on and on and on , but I wont 

My 5 pros which carry no real weight in my mind:
-A bigger family at holidays
-Someone for our youngest to play with
-My friend and I would be pregnant together
-I could have the natural birth I wanted with our 2nd
-I could get my tubes tied after since we will reach our deductible

My (now) ex-boyfriend pressured me into having an abortion, making me feel like I had no choice. The concerns over the extent of his forcefulness &amp; controlling behaviour were also logged at the time by the medical professionals at the abortion clinic. Two days later, he dumped me over text, told me he never wants to have children with me completely cut me off, and within two weeks, he was posting date night pictures with someone new, as I lay in bed still recovering physically &amp; mentally. He has a narcissistic mother that also blocked me on the day of my surgery and never even acknowledged that I was pregnant. Its just them two, his father is not around &amp; has a completely new family. Its like they both erased me and my baby overnight.

The worst part isI regret it. I didnt want to go through with it, but I was made to feel like I had no choice. I would cancel consultations until he noticed I was doing that so he would start driving me there, I couldnt take the preparation pill for hours but the amount of force I had received, it made me feel like I would be in serious danger if I kept my baby. Now, Im left with this overwhelming grief that I dont know how to process. I feel like a part of me is missing, and I dont know if Ill ever forgive myself. Its hard to function normally when the pain is this heavy. Its been 3 weeks now and I havent eaten a full meal since the day before the surgery, Im signed off work due to my mental health, I dont have any friends as he completely isolated me, and I get no more than 3 hours sleep a night. 

What makes this even harder is that just 10 days before I conceived, I was told I was infertile. Because of my PCOS, one of my ovaries no longer works, and I was led to believe that getting pregnant naturally would be nearly impossible for me. So when I found out I was pregnant, it felt like a miraclesomething I never thought Id get the chance to experience. And now, knowing that I was forced into giving that up, without knowing if Ill ever get another chance, makes the grief even more unbearable.

2025-03-16,1742127558.0,Post MA and I feel hopeless,"(Throwaway account! Sorry, english is not my first language, pardon my grammar lapses)

Had a successful MA yesterday. Process only took me 4 hours to pass my precious angel. The procedure didnt go very well and heres the context.

March 14,2025
- I asked my live-in partner if he can take a day off this weekend to help me with my MA. I explained and said sorry in advance if I ever sound demanding as this procedure is mentally and emotionally draining for me. He said yes, assured me that he would be there. I already took mifepristone at 11:30am. 
- Later that afternoon, he asked permission if he can report work to fulfill his duties as it was critical for him to decline (hes an engineer and I cant really understand how does his workload looks like on a daily basis) that he also needs to work on Sunday for rotational work. I also told him that I may not understand his workload, but I understand that he needs to focus at work, but the stress hes giving me is just unnecessary.
- As a response, I lashed out on him, voicing out my frustrations and he took it negatively and broke up with me as I was affecting his career.
- At that time, I was really disappointed that he cant fulfill his words.
- ADDITIONAL CONTEXT: 2024 I was at the hospital cause Im about to give birth to our first born, he left me at the hospital for the same reason.. WORK.. that they are understaffed and no one will shoulder his workload. My doctors and midwife even spoke to him to straighten up his priorities as Im in active labor, that they cant proceed with anything unless theres a guardian that can accommodate them if something happens to me, but ofc, as usual, he was really firm with his decision to prioritize his work over his partner. Im new in town and I barely even have friends to ask help with.

March 15 
- at 11:30am already took the first dose of misoprostol and it all came back to me, the abandonment, the neglect from the day I gave birth, and after childbirth, the paternity leave I gave him was just useless, later on I figure out that he didnt disclosed that I was pregnant to his company. And yes, he left me with child care after birth with minimal help as he told me, as he ALWAYS told me that I need to be self-sufficient. And yesterday, it all crashed down on me. The same reason I had to deal with from the times I asked him for help. So I decided to handle things on my own. I went through the process scared, anxious, paranoid and alone.
- He went to work in the morning and went home around 12pm to offer help but my mind is already dysregulated and already disconnected that I refused to receive any help from him. Then he got angry and started shouting and even throwing things inside our room while im actively going through the abortion. Even threatened to hit me but shouted in front of my face instead.
- I was still firm that Im not gonna accept any help from him, the amount of stress that hes giving me is just not helping. So I was left with my 1 year old, crying, doing tantrums while my body is shaking, painfully going through the process. He didnt even bother with child care so I can focus with my process. Idk, hes trying to help but not really helping, shit made me really confused at this point, but oh well, what can I do? I just continued the process with all the emotions that Im feeling. No one to talk to, just trying to seek comfort while watching tiktok clips. 
- 3pm, I was able to finish the procedure and was crying and breaking down for couple of hours after seeing my angel. 
- The next few hours I started bleeding heavily, passing big clots after and cramping so bad that ibuprofen didnt even help to minimize the pain. Fell asleep but woke up around 3am with severe cramping, passed another big clots until dawn. 
- I woke at 3am and I thought It was already done but he even messaged my only friend whos been there for me but was not pro-abortion, telling her that she should check on me as I was doing the abortion. Now my only friend already FOd me as it was against her ethics to tolerate this. I felt betrayed for what he did and disappointed with everything that I just want to die. My grief was beyond comprehension, I just dont understand anything anymore at this point.

March 16
- Post MA today, Im still somewhat heavily bleeding 1 1/2 pads within 2 hours, but I decided to go to the mall as if nothing happened, hoping I can pass out there and die, I was just nauseous and dizzy but still able to walk and even bought groceries for me and my 1 year old baby. 
- I broke down after eating, almost had a panic attack while lining up to the cashier cause I saw a pregnant woman being held by her husband/partner

I just got home and I broke down again. I cant do this anymore, this is just too much for me. My body is trembling and I feel cold. I just dont know how to push forward from here.

I slept with a  situationship who told me he loved me and had feelings for me and got pregnant. I wont say it was completely unplanned as we were drunk, he said do you want my babies, I said yes. 

Fast forward 5 weeks later I find out I am pregnant. I was initially excited but then we had a conversation and  I realised he was really excited to have a child but wasnt sure if he wanted to get to get to know me or try be in a serious relationship.

I asked him why he had previously told me he loved me and he said, that he didnt know why but that we would be alright. 

I know that he has a visa that limits him on the type of companies that will sponsor him, which is something he complains about everytime we speak. I am scared he is going to use our child to get a family visa.

I also have an underlying condition which could cause me to have a difficult pregnancy and having to go through all that by myself, will be difficult. 

I am thinking about having an abortion but I feel bad as I did all this to myself and should have been more careful. Am I selfish for considering an abortion?",abortion,9.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jc2m49/am_i_selfish_for_considering_an_abortion_uk/
2025-03-16,1742091821.0,"rpoc 2 weeks after MA at 10.5 weeks, D+E?","had a medical abortion at 10.5 weeks for a pregnancy i desperately wanted to keep, but i didnt have enough support to guarantee the babys wellbeing. this was a couple months after a breakup with the person i have lived with for the past 2 years and thought i was going to marry. broke my wrist and dropped out of my graduate program during the pregnancy and got a concussion around a week ago. needless to say, this has been some of the hardest few months of my life. 

i have not bled but only been passing tissue since the MA, and i was able to get them to do an ultrasound when i went to the ER for the concussion. they consulted with my OB/GYN and i have 1.3cm thick tissue on my endometrium retained from the pregnancy. i was given the option of waiting to see if it passes with subsequent periods, but im terrified of retained tissue leading to future pregnancy complications. tried misoprostol again for the tissue and absolutely nothing happened, so they scheduled me for D+E later this week. i am so tired and just want to get to the point where i can cope with the grief and depression and work towards having my life back. 

i made the decision to have the procedure because of this, but im also really do not want to have to go through another traumatic medical experience, especially without support. i have read a lot of others stories about waiting for this tissue to pass for months without any luck. is going through with the D+E worth it? should i wait? please feel free to share experiences in either direction, hope everyone is getting by out there d",abortion,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jcbhj1/rpoc_2_weeks_after_ma_at_105_weeks_de/

2025-03-16,1742130864.0,Seating at mass,"Im a family of 4 , with a 2 year old and a 3 month old , we need some real estate when it comes to seats . Having to pack the caravan to get to church is a huge hurdle . Its difficult to even arrive on time at times . Yesterday we arrived 5 minutes before mass started and realized that the church was a full house . We walk in to see no unseated pews . 

I guess my rant, if you will , is every time I go to mass I see the same thing, one person (multiple people do this) in a pew sitting at the end kind of blocking the available seats. This makes it awkward because clearly the solo sitter or couple is doing this so they dont have to share the pew with randoms or want to receive the Eucharist first or need an aisle seat for some reason . To me I dont care I will politely ask for them to move to squeeze in . But if the family with kids comes in during the first reading, they are cooked , feeling awkward and stand in the back or mid mass ask to squeeze in to a row 2/3s up the church .

One might say get there earlier and secure a row . Arriving early allows you to prepare yourself for mass . 10 minutes early is on time.
I say to this - I wish we could . Its not as easy for a mom who pumps , baby who eats every 2-3 hours , a toddler who is a toddler and a dad who lassos everyone in to arrive early . We are lucky to make it on time .  Also kids in a quiet setting have a time limit . I start losing the toddler around the preparation of the Eucharist so I we got there earlier quite possibly we can lose her mid gospel sermon .  No my church does not have a child crying room. 

One might say  maybe divide the family and go to separate masses so you can arrive early and easier to manage the kids  
I say to this . Absolutely not , we are a family, our faith is collective. 




To end my rant , please if you are are solo or a couple and arrive 10-15 minutes early try to move to the inside of the pew to allow the next wave of people to be seated with out having to ask you to move. Or maybe consider sitting with another solo or couple and enjoy worshipping together , this might allow a larger family quietly find seating .I say this all with love and good will . And I never had someone be mad about moving for us , typically greeted with a smile . Just an observation

We went back, the hemorrhage was a bit bigger, wife continued progesterone and bed rest, just this saturday she bled like 2 tissues worth of blood so I rushed her to the ER, the OB said that the hemorrhage was gone and the baby was actually 2-3 days bigger than the estimate and has good heart rate. Everything was normal, closed and long cervix and everything, she had a speculum to check, cervix was normal

2025-03-15,1742078866.0,38w and lots of anxiety,"Hi all! 

Kind of looking for advice and guidance here&

Im almost at my due date and feeling mentally more and more unstable. Not because of the delivery or postpartum, but because of (irrational) fears and anxiety. 
Im feeling over protective already and am creating scenarios in my head that are driving me crazy. As a result Im feeling sad, angry and terrified all the time. For example Im scared that after the delivery the baby will be taken away from me and I wont have that golden hour skin to skin (for whatever reason) or that family or grand parents will come by uninvited and claim the baby as their own. 
Ive been judged when I said that I would like to spend the first day(s) with my husband and the baby alone to bond saying that Im robbing the grand parents from their time with their first grand baby. It already feels that I owe people MY child that I carried. Im scared that when the baby leaves my body that I have to share him (even with my husband) and that I wont even matter anymore, cause I was just the body that was needed to make this human. 
Im angry at my husband all the time and although he says he wont tell anyone once we have the baby or send pics of the baby without my consent, I struggling to believe him because I will be tired and weak and wont be able to control everything. This is so not me..
Im a midwife and nurse myself so I should know that my anxiety is exaggerated. Im scared that this overbearing will drive me in a postpartum psychosis. Any of you who experienced these feelings?",pregnant,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jc79bz/38w_and_lots_of_anxiety/

I'm 9 weeks today. Supposedly. 
I'm freaking out constantly that maybe it's already gone. 
This is my third pregnancy, the first made it to 8 weeks but didn't develop past 7. Ended in a d&amp;c. The second made it to 7 and had a miscarriage on my own but I knew it was coming because my blood work wasn't great. 
This one I found out about on Valentine's. I'm not going to lie the timing couldn't be worse, 2 weeks after my due date is my brother's wedding that my husband is the best man in, I'm in the bridal party, and it's all happening at my parents house 4 hours away. But I still want this so bad. 
My husband is very encouraging and says we will keep trying as long as it takes but I'm 37. 
I have two different doctors, my normal gyno doesn't do babies anymore so she recommended my OB. I haven't seen the OB this pregnancy yet, I'm supposed to have an appointment this Wednesday and an ultrasound Thursday. I'm now freaking out because I went to look at the times and they're not showing up in the app anymore so if they got cancelled I'm going to cry. 
My normal gyno ordered blood work Feb 19 that was great and an ultrasound on Feb 26th that was also right on track. 
But I am not having morning sickness at all, maybe I'm just lucky. My breasts are tender and I'm extra gassy and very emotional and tired. But that's all my symptoms. It's making me so nervous. I keep wanting to like just keep taking pregnancy tests or something. How do you get over not knowing if it's ok or not? 
Like eventually they move and stuff so I imagine that will be reassuring. But if it's still there this is the furthest I've ever been but I just don't know if it's still there. 
I'm so sorry this is just a ramble. My Brain is fried, my therapist is out of town for a few weeks, I'm having a time haha.

If you can share anything, please do. Im sorry its so long, I tried to trim everything down but theres just so much.***

My pregnancy has been more of an emotional rollercoaster than I even thought it could be. Im currently due June 2nd, and Im not sure what all to expect with the last couple months. 

In the first half of my pregnancy, I was diagnosed with HG and was throwing up constantly and unable to keep food or medication down, resulting in me losing around thirty pounds within the first trimester. It was incredibly hard for me and my husband. If I hadnt known I was pregnant I wouldve thought I had cancer or some serious illness. 

We were waiting to tell our families in person, but we live out of state. Just before we went to see them we had our first ultrasound, and got to see the baby for the very first time. It was incredible, and breathtaking. It made it all feel so worth it. I was so glad to see my sickness wasnt effecting him like I was worried it was. 

We finally got to tell our families we were pregnant around week 14, for Thanksgiving. It was absolutely beautiful, and something Ill remember the rest of my life.

Immediately following Thanksgiving, I got incredibly sick, on top of my HG situation. Some sort of respiratory sickness they couldnt put a name on, and couldnt give me medication for at first. For one week, I really thought I was going to die I was so ill. On top of the HG, I couldnt breathe, had severe chest pains that I even went to the ER for because I got so scared, was coughing so hard it made me cry and vomit. It was so painful. I had a mental breakdown, and truly thought the baby might not make it. They ended up finally giving me medication to help at least a little. It took another week to feel like it was getting better.

I was able to get a couple of days at work that week. I had been missing most days of work for two months. I came home on December 12th, and my beloved kitty got her wings that night. It was my first true loss, and it was really hard. 

That next week we found out that we are having a boy, and getting to share the news with family and my husband is something I will cherish forever. It was so wonderful. 

Over Christmas, my HG finally seemed to be letting up. It was amazing. I ate food for the first time in months that wasnt rice or bread. We stayed home instead of seeing family because it had made me so so sick last time, and to spend time with our other pets. It was beautiful, and it even snowed a tiny bit.

Come new years, my HG was back, but my belly was starting to show and we had gotten to see him on ultrasound again. I tried to push through and make it to work. My boss pulled me aside and told me that I whod been missing too much, even with everything going on. That they understood, but if I missed or called out one more day within 8 weeks they would take me to part time and cut my benefits. They acted like I was just staying home because I wanted to and not because I was horribly sick. We were running out of our savings, it wasnt like I didnt need to be there, I couldnt. Adding an entire new stress to my situation. 

We get our 20 week anatomy scan mid January. They were unable to see his face, with his arms up, and needed to get another scan soon to try to check for cleft. They are unable to see his heart fully. They tell me they also saw what may be a tumor is his brain, and will check it again next time. At this point theyve been taking blood and urine samples every time I come in. My white blood cell count is double what it should be and had been that way since I got sick at Thanksgiving. They let me know they are sending me to a specialist but not to worry. I am definitely worried for my little guy.

They schedule me a few more weeks out for another ultrasound. I try to make it to work, as Im in fear of losing my benefits so close to birth. Im throwing up multiple times a day and having to leave my desk constantly. Theyre upset Im not able to grab someone to cover the desk on my way to run to the restroom to vomit. Theyre upset I seem sick, tired, and on the verge of tears at the front desk. Not a good look for them. Exactly why Ive been staying home. 

They got my results back and tell me I might have small kidney stones and to drink a ton of water to try to flush them out. Super easy request seeing as Im still throwing up multiple times a day. 

The specialist is an oncologist. They are watching me to see if I have leukemia. Didnt know that until I literally am sitting in the oncologist office, and shes the one to tell me why Im there. I get they didnt want me to worry. But Im starting to feel like Im falling apart.

Im finally feeling his kicks and movements. Its bringing me a lot of peace, and its so wonderful to feel like hes okay in there. We get our ultrasound and no tumor, no cleft and no heart defect. thank God. We started getting stuff for the nursery and putting things together. The HG is getting lighter. Only a few days a week Im throwing up. I feel like I can truly see the beautiful light at the end of the tunnel.

I developed this cyst in my right breast, that grew from a dime size to about the size of a clementine, and was so incredibly painful. It got red and swollen until it was purple. Again they didnt want to give me antibiotics and there was nothing I could do but put a compress on. I couldnt even wear a bra. I had to keep going to work or they would drop my benefits. Eventually the cyst burst on its own and all this puss came out. It drained for three days. They had to express it further and finally put me on antibiotics. I had that open wound on my breast for about a week, and kept having to rewrap it, to the point the tape was tearing little parts of my skin off. But it did finally heal. 

This past week, Tuesday I wake up with some sort of respiratory situation again. My throat is so sore I cant swallow and have a fever. They still want me to come into work, so I do. 

We woke up Wednesday morning to my beloved dog Sam having some neurological symptoms, and we had to lay her to rest on Wednesday. After thirteen beautiful years. This is the hardest thing Ive ever been through. 

I try to go to work Thursday, but I was so broken I just left. I told my boss I couldnt be here, I couldnt even think. Theyre probably going to fire me. I dont even care anymore. I cant deal with all of this. Im now so incredibly sick, coughing things up, sore throat, drainage etc; if I could, I wouldnt go in to work tomorrow either. 

Please: I need some advice. Any advice. If you been through a rough pregnancy or grieving while going through this, please let me know how you made it. I feel like Im trying my best to keep my head held high but its one thing after another, like waves crashing down on my head and I cant catch my breath. I dont know what to do or how to navigate this. Im trying to stay positive for the baby and take care of us, still show up to work, etc. But I feel so broken right now.",pregnant,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jciufi/emotional_rollercoaster/

2025-03-16,1742112899.0,Rejected by best friend for being pregnant,"My best friend just cant handle the fact that I want to have a baby and live a heteronormative life. So today, 5 days out from my scheduled c section, she texted me that our friendship is essentially over and shes processing the grief so I need to leave her space. To be clear, she very much wants to stay in my life, but not my babys (wtf lol, shes absolutely not invited-ever- to meet my baby) and shes trying to recover from this perceived betrayal Ive taken with my life choices. 

Making this post as I feel very alone. 

**Background:**
Im 37, married, financially and emotionally stable, have so much support from extended family, am employed with very good parental leave (I live in Germany so its 14 months paid)& Im laying this out to explain that having a baby is not a dumb or rash decision, and that isnt her basis for criticism. 

**The issues:**
I am giving birth in 5 days to a very wanted baby and my best friend has been nothing but negative and mean about it from the beginning. 

For example, I told her Im pregnant and she wrote back RIP to your life, I brushed it off as a joke. She asked me why I would do that, ruin my life, give it up for a life of screaming and hell etc etc. 

**she hates my nursery** love interior design and spent a lot of time and money getting the nursery together. I commissioned my friend who is an artist to paint a custom mural on the wall tying in my cultural history and my husbands cultural history. Its fckn cute. When I showed my best friend I was so proud and she commented  about how ugly it is and she hates it but followed up with oh well at least i dont have to spend any time here looking at it. I let it go. I also got a super rare antique Murano glass chandelier for the room and I know its beautiful. She told me its tacky. Since then she brought up 3 times without prompting or being asked how much she hates the baby room. 

**worst case scenario births** When I was about 16 weeks pregnant and vomiting all day she took it upon herself to outline every single worst case scenario that can happen in birth, from permanent fecal incontenance, to having your uterus removed. I told her to stop (this was via text) and she pushed back and told me I was brainwashed by propaganda and if I knew the truth I would never even have a baby& Its her job to educate me. (Was super offensive and disturbing). 

**life ruined** At about 25 weeks she explained how much my career will suffer and how men avoid doing work within the home and women end up doing everything, about male weaponised incompetence etc.  also about mothers judging each other in mother groups and how bitchy it is (I get that but she knows my scandanavian husband and whats hes like- we have such an equal partnership). 

**c section** It came to a head yesterday when I texted her to tell her Im having a c section on Friday. I said c section on Friday, omg Im so excited and scared. She wrote back the next day well this is your last free weekend ever& you should go out and party. I guess thats not a bad response but it just was the last straw. I told her im sensitive at the moment and I need support and Im genuinely being hurt by her constant barbs and negativity. If she cant be at least neutral then I need some space.

She wrote back that she thanks me for telling her my needs and she will tell me her needs tomorrow. Then I got this big list about how she doesnt believe in motherhood and having babies from a political standpoint, she is genuinely disgusted by babies, she is **grieving the loss of my friendship** (totally news to me since I didnt know we werent friends anymore!). 

Anyways Im just down about it all. Making this post to see if anyone has any words about similar experiences or how to handle the situation. Shes been a big part of my life and strong support and great friend so Im honestly hurt.

And its also sad that shes given me so much negativity about babies and birth that it has overshadowed my excitement for the birth. I mean, I just wrote her one message and end up in this huge discussion about how hard this is for her, and feeling like I need to apologise to her for having a baby .
Is she trying to be mean ? I dont get it 

Edit: shes self diagnosed autistic on the spectrum which is why I have given her so much Lee-way. Im asking myself at what point is it ok to stop being understanding and letting it go ",pregnant,130.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jcgsyf/rejected_by_best_friend_for_being_pregnant/

2025-03-16,1742136501.0,How do I tell my boyfriend I want our daughter to have my last name?,"A little bit of context - I (26F) am 8 months pregnant with my (32M) boyfriends daughter. 

We unexpectedly got pregnant and found out in August of last year. Once we found out, my entire world changed. I obviously stopped drinking, vaping, caffeine, everything to ensure I had a healthy, safe pregnancy (which thankfully I have). My boyfriend struggled with the change. For months, I found him sneaking alcohol behind my back, hiding drinking from me, and being completely irresponsible. We had the talk many times before that if this happened abortion was not an option (for me, I am 100% pro choice though). Here is why: 

I have worked very hard to become financially stable and independent. I purchased my first home at 24 which we live in together (everything is in my name). I have a full time job that I have been at for 3 years with great benefits (including the health insurance that has gotten us 100% through this pregnancy). I work from home and have the ability to keep my daughter home with me once she is born, and 3 months of paid maternity leave. I put money in savings every month and only have a car payment/mortgage. So in my mind, and what we agreed to before, was if I got pregnant we would keep the baby. 

Over the last 8 months, our relationship has really struggled. He has not been supportive or helped me in any way. I have purchased everything for the baby (almost $4,000 worth), paid for our maternity photos, scheduled all the doctors appointments, cooked my own meals, did the nursery alone. All while he was drinking (which he finally says he stopped, I dont have the energy to care anymore), and smoking weed every single day (he still does this). 

I have cried to him many times about the emotional state of our relationship and how I need him at this time but nothing has changed. There is no intimacy in our relationship, and he only cares about himself and the image of having a girlfriend/baby on the way. He owns his own business and does not have health insurance so he contributes nothing (and has NO plan to) for our daughters health. It will all fall on me. 

Im writing to ask, how do I tell him I want her to have my last name? I am terrified our relationship wont last this way, Ive asked about counseling but of course I would have to pay for it. He gets offended when I ask. But I am doing everything for our child. He just feels we are lucky that we wont have to pay for childcare and that Ill breastfeed to save money on formula. But those are still sacrifices I am making, because I will be a full time employee (and bread winner) who is also taking care of our child. 

If our relationship does turn around and we decide to get married one day, it would be much easier to change her last name than to ever get his permission to change it

And she is taking it out on *me*.","My sister and I don't have the best relationship to begin with, which makes this a lot harder. She has narcissistic tendencies and there was a period of time where we didn't speak for almost 6 months. But she is always very insistent on us being family and that she wants to do things for me, and has been absolutely *adamant* about planning my baby shower for me. It just always needs to be on her terms, or she likes having something to threaten me with or dangle over my head (i.e. baby shower). Like, if I upset her in any way, she says ""well I just won't throw your baby shower then."" It's a control thing. This leads to her procrastinating, not getting things done in time, dropping the ball, or just not doing things at all. It's a lifelong pattern.

My mother in law is an absolute angel. She and I are very alike, meaning she has been on top of everything. She volunteered to do the whole thing and was very happy to join with my sister when I suggested it. My sister seemed happy with it too. Until my sister just didn't do anything for it.

Fast forward a little bit, at 20 weeks pregnant my MIL said she didn't hear from my sister so she booked the venue and did all the phone calls to actually find a place. My sister did not help.

At 21 weeks pregnant, MIL and I are finding addresses and making spreadsheets to make RSVPs easier. My sister didn't add a single address.

At 21+3 weeks pregnant, my MIL sent my sister and I a message updating about addresses, and she specifically mentioned my sister's name and asked her if she wanted to do the invitations. I didn't hear back from my sister in days and, unsure of she reached out to MIL directly, I texted her myself asking if she said anything. She said she didn't because she's been so busy. Her never-ending excuse for everything she doesn't feel like doing. I said fine whatever. I texted MIL to let her know (kindly) about my sister procrastinating and to let me know if she doesn't hear back.

At 22 weeks pregnant, we see MIL in person, and she is excitedly showing DH and I shower invites she created! They're beautiful and so cute, and she took so much stress off of me in that moment. But fearing my narcissistic sister, I asked if MIL ever heard back from my sister. She said she did not. Of course!! Ugh.

Fast forward to last night 22+2, I talked to my sister to let her know that MIL was planning on moving full speed ahead of she didn't hear back. My sister attempted to give me every excuse in the book, and started saying ""well why didn't she follow up with me then??"" She completely ignored the fact that she did in fact receive MIL's message, AND mine following up. I told her she needs to communicate and that's why MIL is moving forward, because it needs to be done. The shower is still 3 months away but MIL wants to order invites and have family from out of state come, so about 2 months beforehand they will go out. My sister said she was planning on ordering the invitations at the end of April when she finally would have time. I said that is over a month from now! She became very aggressive toward me and said ""Your mother in law just wanted to help and now she's doing the whole thing!""

What she doesn't know is that I've learned to hold my ground.

I told her yes, my MIL is doing the whole thing right now, because you cannot communicate with anyone, you procrastinate, and this has to be done. You can do games or themes or decorations when you ""have time"" later, but I am not doing this with you. There is a baby on the way and he will come on the due date, not when you ""have time."" The shower will be done on the date it is scheduled. Not when you ""have time.""

My husband is aware and is very supportive. I reached out to my MIL to let her know that I spoke with my sister about everything (again leaving out details of arguments and feelings). I told her if she doesn't hear back from my sister before the end of the weekend to move forward with the invitation order.

I'm done sparing feelings for my sister because she doesn't seem to prioritize mine in any way. She hasn't lifted a finger for this shower and lets things go too far before she even starts. Not to mention she is completely broke and can't afford anything. My MIL is an absolute hero and I love her. It just sucks that my sister can't get her shit together long enough to even plan a party. A very important one to shower her first nephew to be.

Thanks for listening. This has been an utter nightmare but I feel a lot better not sparing feelings for someone who doesn't give a crap about mine. I am happy to grow a backbone and stand up for myself and my husband and my baby, and I am thankful to have my amazing MIL on my side.",pregnant,12.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jcjcep/my_sister_wants_to_plan_the_baby_shower_but_is/
2025-03-16,1742093328.0,Hospitalization,"Yesterday and today have been a long day, but yesterday I had made plans to unalive myself. I have been suffering with depression + suicidal ideation for years now, I was on medication that helped me for 9 months before I found out I was pregnant. My prenatal care provider had advised me there isnt enough research on the medication I was on during pregnancy, so she had told me the risks and I had opted out of taking it. Mostly because I had took it once and started bleeding for a few days and we were never able to find out what was the cause of the bleeding but it scared me enough out of taking it.

Dont get me wrong I love my baby, and I choose to keep my baby for that reason. I am about to be 20 weeks tomorrow, Ive been struggling with family issues, losing a friend and problems with my childs father since the beginning of my pregnancy. I slowly felt myself getting pushed to the edge (although I did reach out to my doctor for help and we were trying to make a plan to help me mentally during the pregnancy and put me back in therapy) yesterday somethings happened within my family and I did start to plan to unalive myself. 

I noticed me falling into my suicidal ideation and I took myself to get help at the ER, since my doctor has told me go get help when I need it. I told a few of my friends what happened and Im getting a few your being selfish , you have a baby who is depending on you now but I been asking for help for months from these people. Especially my childs father and people didnt take my cries for help serious, until now. 

Im glad I noticed the red flags and went to go get help so I didnt hurt me or baby but right now I just feel like shit, the pressure just got to me.

Update: I am currently in the psych ward department in the ER, I have been since Friday night. I started on Zoloft yesterday 50 mg, and Im feeling okay just nausea. The plan is to put me in a in patient psych ward and I dont know how I feel about that, but I guess its what they believe is best for me and baby.

That kind of changed the entire course of things and now hes only due to be back a month or two post the babys birth.

My and my husbands families will both get the registry because, of course, they are all invited to the baby shower. I love my in-laws, but many among them have a so you think youre better than me? attitude when it comes to money. While my family certainly isnt wealthy, his family is mostly from very modest means in rural US.

My husband and I both have great careers and few expenses, so we are going a little upscale on some of our items. (Nothing crazy, but no fear of the $800 stroller or $200 diaper bag if thats whatll make our life easier). We also have some non-necessaries, like the ceres chill and baby brezza.

That whole time, I was just anxious and my every thought was ""don't be excited because you could lose it"" sure enough, I did. But man I wish I had just let myself experience the joy of finding out I was pregnant. It was already sad to lose the baby, but to think about that whole experience and see I was just negative the whole time. It's heartbreaking to see myself that way. I have always wanted to be a mother, and I thought I was guarding my heart. But I was denying myself the joy of motherhood, even if it was just for a week. 

This time, I'm about 5 weeks, and I wake up and choose to be excited and LOVE this baby for however long I get to have it. I get to be a MOM! And yes, I know I'm early. I know that stats show I have a 20% of losing this. But I'm hanging on to that 80% that I won't. I am choosing to embrace this season, love deeply, feel connectedness to my womb. And I will tell the people I know who will celebrate this with me, and ignore any judgment. I bought gender neutral onsies a couple of days ago because I wanted to and I'm GLAD I did! This baby is so loved, and I am optimistic I will meet them someday. But if I don't, then I'll know that I allowed myself to experience this pregnancy authentically me. I will mourn my loss, I will be heartbroken, but I'll know the motherly love I have was given the space it needed during this time.

I just needed to rant. I feel like I see so many ""I hate to be a Debbie downer BUT..."" comments on many early excited pregnancy posts, and I just wanted to be the positive voice. We are all scared, we are all anxious, and we all know the odds!!! We know the worst case scenario! But I refuse to let that energy into this pregnancy.

When she asked the name and I told her, she had a visceral reaction to it and was not shy about saying she didn't like it. Lol. 

When she asked to see the ultrasound, she got creeped out by it and said it looks disgusting. Lmao.

The list goes on but I digress. 

The way I've been dealing is to act shocked and say wowww, you're the ONLY person who's said that to me. Then I start telling them about how everyone else in my life is so supportive, loves the name, gushes over the ultrasound. She didn't know how to react =

I think the trick is even though it stings, act as positive as possible and show them that it doesn't affect you. Make THEM out like THEY are the weird ones for being all negative Nancy. Honestly it works a charm. 

Someone says baby doesn't look like you even though baby is a spitting image of you? ""Wowww! That's so interesting you say that, you know, you're the only one who has said that. Everyone else says she looks just like me!"" :)

Getting dressed is so difficult. Im simultaneously excited to see my baby grow but feel embarrassed to be visibly pregnant. 

My parents came into town to visit today. I dont have the best relationship with my mom, its been strained since childhood. (Shes narcissistic and a little emotionally immature). Ive been in therapy for years to heal from abuse and work on maintaining healthy boundaries with my family.

Visit was going good until she reached out to touch my stomach at lunch. I reflexively jumped in my seat and loudly said NO. She looked genuinely confused, THEN asked if she could feel baby. I again said no. I felt like I was going to crawl out of my skin and felt a primal sense of protection? I felt rage.

She then said well I can when you get bigger and baby is kicking. I again said no, I do not want to be touched I dont like being touched. She again repeated that she could.

They have been closely monitoring me since week 20 and i was told early intervention will be needed if necessary, it took me awhile to process this but i was mentally prepared. Our goal was to reach 37 /36 week but not to go beyond that because anything more than that will cause distress to the baby. So yesterday my OB wanted me to get admitted because she didnt want to take any chances also because of my Bp 130/100 and will closely monitor me for IUGR for coming weeks. My Bp looks normal this morning which is funny  and baby is actively moving so I feel stupid now for rushing to the hospital. I was also given steroid shot. I know being around the nurses is the safest for my baby but I really want to make it at least to 36 weeks. My OB told me the baby will come anytime if there is severe growth restriction i know she wants the best for me and the baby but I want to cook it for longer, in 2 days time I will be 34 weeks. So i just need 2 weeks more at least but i am shit scared for nicu if the baby comes early. I wonder if they will ever discharge me or wont let me out until I delivery this baby. 
Sometimes I feel like i am wasting everyones time here since everything looks good as for now. Bp stabilized, heart beat normal and she is moving and I blame my anxiety for agreeing to be admitted, maybe I couldve just waiting for one more week. 
And now I  ranting here thinking whether i did a right thing panicking for no reason. I know its too late now as I am already admitted but just wanted some reassurance here whether i did the right thing. 
Also I would love to hear positive stories of 34 weeker Nicu baby. Because my chances she might be evacuated around 34.

I would describe my husband as a pretty stoic, rational man. He doesnt really give in to negative emotions, generally is able to stay on the positive side of things. He is pretty indifferent to small daily stressors, not overwhelmed easily. Pretty even keel. 

Well he dropped a bomb on me the other day that he is really struggling with not feeling important or a priority during the pregnancy. That his feelings are responsible for him not showing me affection and being distant lately. His justification for these feelings are based off a casual conversation we had a month ago where he said he felt like he was on the back burner to which I agreed. I said it sucks but yeah you kind of are, Im the one thats pregnant. The focus needs to be on me and the baby. 

Apparently he had been feeling badly for some time before he brought it up a month ago and said that the conversation just confirmed what he was feeling so he just decided to harbor negative feelings and allow them to change the way he interacted with me. But he let me leave that conversation feeling like things were resolved and led me to believe we were in a good place. 

I feel pretty blindsided. Hes done this before, concealed feelings and let them negatively impact our relationship and then it all kinda blows up. Im due in less than 3 weeks, why did he have to do this now??? 

Anyway idk Im questioning everything. Im feeling like my sacrifices have been all for naught and Ive not been appreciated or acknowledged for anything Ive done. Youd think I was abusive or something toward him or putting all the responsibility on him. I havent been. Ive still been working, taking care of the household, shopping, etc. even though its been such a struggle. I try not to even ask him for things because I feel like a burden. 

Im in so much pain lately and trying to mentally and physically prep for birth and Im getting hit with this crap right now. I mean what was I supposed to do, coddle him this entire time? I just dont really understand it. Im just so tired and dont know where to go from here. I dont even feel like talking to him about it or fighting about it. 

Ironically enough, I had just written him a heartfelt letter and put together a box of all his favorite snacks to give him before the baby is here..

Had my anatomy scan 2 weeks after finishing my dose and asked to be reswabbed to check for cure. Was denied due to false positives showing up within a month of stopping antibiotics ??? (this was my actual ob, the previous tests were done by PAs) Started cramping about a week later for about 36 hours, was recommended to get checked for vaginal infections (UGHHHH!) came back positive. Now Ive just started the Metronidazole gel for the next five days. I feel like I am losing my freaking mind. I have never had any sort of infection in my life and now I cant get it to go away. Ive been changing my underwear 2x a day, been taking showers morning and night, letting everything air dry before putting my underwear on, stopped having sex. And NOTHING IS WORKING. im at my wits end and just want some reassurance that my baby will be fine regardless of if this doesnt go away.

So normally im not one to complain but this is my first baby and ive waited and rescheduled this anatomy scan so many times so my experience really upset me. Also no im not homophobic maybe im wrong but a lot of the stuff im about to right that was said just kind of annoyed me.


So to start it off the appointment was 20 minutes late and my mum had driven hours to come and see the baby and this ultrasound is supposed to be the last one to see the baby before birth and we paid $270. My partner and i were super excited as i had been in hospital a few days prior for reduced movement so just wanted to see our girl. We got into the appointment and the man doing our scan was super entitled, rude to my mum, myself and partner. he breaks part of the equipment before we even start and i just brush it off, he then put the tv screen on where we can see the baby and it doesnt turn on properly, we asked if maybe someone could check it out and he said that this scan wasnt for our entertainment and theres a reason he didnt go into IT, at this point i kind of just wanted to cry. He kept on pressing way to hard and would pull my pants down without even asking me (yes i know sometime they need to go low but its nice to have a little warning instead of someone ripping your pants down). He then asked if we new the gender and i said yes its a girl we are super excited and was talking about her little outfits and he said i prefer not to gender them and colour isnt really a gender thing anyways. At this point i kind of gathered his opinions and views and it really annoyed me how he treated us. i understand everyone is allowed their views but it felt wrong that he kept on shutting down my own opinions and excitement on my own daughter. Finally he tried to take a few of her measurements and couldnt get them, he took the measurements which put her way behind her date instead of rescheduling and kept calling her annoying because she wouldnt move or would suck on her hand or something shed do. i barely got to see her cause the screen was broken. Anyways needed to vent or ill cry, i have an appointment with my OB tuesday and GP wednesday. Am i wrong for wanting another scan and being upset?

My baby is 10 months old and I just found out I'm pregnant again (this was wanted and we're so excited). 

My boy is a massive 99th percentile and has always loved food whether it's boob or solids. Even before I got pregnant, the daily feeds were starting to get hard. He's got 8 teeth and he would suck a little then just bite me - never seemed interested in actually having a decent feed. I would always offer before then giving him solids. The first feed when he wakes up for the day has remained really good. 

I've been pumping heaps to try and maintain supply in case he wants to come back to it more during the day but if I'm honest, it's starting to feel pointless. 

Now I'm pregnant again. I'm tired. I have stuff I want to accomplish before baby number 2 and wasting the time to pump when I'm barely getting anything anymore just feels... pointless? 

He likes formula and I know there's nothing wrong with it but I always had it in my mind he wouldn't need formula and I would feed him until at least a year but idk how achievable that goal is now. 

Being pregnant again I'm just so freaking tired and part of me feels like I should give my body a break. I will keep up with the morning feeds as long as he lets me cos another huge part is not ready for this journey to end with him. :(

I'm currently 10w3d and experienced severe nausea and vomiting since about 5 weeks (6 weeks on the dot with the vomiting). I was given Reglan that improved it for a couple days before doing nothing at all besides give me shakiness in my muscles, so I stopped. I got to the point of throwing up about 3-5 times a day and always after a solid meal, went to the ER at 8 weeks because severe dehydration was causing my back and ab muscles to cramp so bad I legitimately thought I had an ectopic (I was also spotting a bit prior), they confirmed baby was progressing as expected with a strong heartbeat and textbook structure/size. They gave me a few days worth of Zofran but my doctor refused to refill because he hadn't seen me yet. Regardless, Zofran was effective for only most of those days but did not stop the puking altogether and the last day I had it, it felt like it did nothing. The nausea was getting worse so out of pure desperation I took the Reglan again and dealt with the unwanted symptoms.

I want to say my nausea peaked (so far) last Wednesday night, I threw up/dry heaved 9 times that day, had an absolute delirious mental episode and considered going to the ER before I eventually just passed out on my bed. Thursday hitting the 10 week mark, I felt *slightly* better but still puking. Friday, puked 3 times. Yesterday once, all acid though, but more bone tired than usual like it was a trade off- first time having solid food since Wednesday.  I never stopped actually being nauseous all day even throughout this. 

This morning my nausea resembled more hunger pains than an actual urge to puke. I feel far more lucid. I don't want to jinx myself, I've been fooled before, but I am at the moment feeling 80% more ""normal."" I've been warned about sudden ends to symptoms as something potentially bad, especially since I read that most people reach their peak nausea symptoms around 10 weeks *if* it's a first trimester thing only, and lasting until 12-14 weeks. 

I guess I'm just looking for a peace of mind. I'm not even sure if I should really call my current symptoms progression as a gradual improvement since the nausea never wavered until literally just this morning. I'm holding on the hope that my boobs are still sore and I'm still sluggish that maybe this is actually a good sign and not something to be concerned about.

2025-03-16,1742127540.0,Worried about my partners mental health (CW loss),"
Im currently 11 weeks pregnant, this is our third pregnancy after a MMC at 13 weeks and a chemical last year. We are now reaching the timeframe we lost our first baby (it passed away at 11.5 weeks). Last week we were told the baby has an enlarged NT which can mean an increased chance of chromosomal abnormalities, were currently (very) anxiously waiting for our NIPT results.

My partner is South African, anyone who knows Afrikaans men will tell you theyre often very traditional and keep to the more classic macho traits. My partner doesnt talk about his feelings - unless hes had a good amount to drink. 

I know my partner struggles with the fact that I obviously feel everything and am so heavily impacted by this pregnancy, he feels kind of on the sideline just waiting to be told how things are going. When I try and talk to him about the pregnancy his response is pretty much always Im sure itll be fine this time. 

On top of that, he doesnt seem that happy with his own stuff. Hes been very demotivated at work for a while. Hes normally very active and also a bit of a thrill seeker, and enjoys a lot of riskier sports. Since our first pregnancy, he quit the riskier stuff, but also hasnt really been enjoying the gym either. He also reads a lot of very negative content online lately and expresses his anger at the state of the world. We currently live in quite a rough area of town, we are moving to the countryside this summer but I know living in this area is also not helping. 

Anyway, over the past few weeks Ive noticed his drinking increase quite a lot. We spoke about it last night and he said he was aware of it, but that he was just so f*cking bored with life at the moment. Obviously with house and baby I was sad to hear this because, although right now life is a little monotonous, we have so much to look forward to. He insisted his feelings were nothing to do with me or our relationship, just the monotony of daily life right now. 

I dont know what to do. He said its not my problem to fix, that he needs to sort himself out. But I cant help but feel really sad about this, on top of the continued pregnancy anxiety, Im really worried about his headspace. Maybe this is how his anxiety comes out, since he doesnt show much emotion in any other capacity. Hes just not the type of person to go speak to someone, so Im not sure how else he can get help.

Yesterday I had a positive pregnancy test so thought I would join this subreddit again. I have 2 boys who are 6 and 3 so this will be my third baby.

Im roughly just over 4 weeks pregnant. I thought I was as my period was 4 days late but I had been testing with some cheap test strips from the day I was due on and they all came back negative. I then did a more expensive test &amp; digital test as I felt pregnant and its unusual for my period to be 4 days late and they both came back positive. 

Excited to be joining this community again even though it all seems a bit surreal at the moment and also slightly worried about life with 3 children as my boys are very active and I feel some days are already pretty chaotic!! Me and my husband are pretty go with the flow people so hopefully we wont feel too overstretched!!

My husband and I always been on the same page for the names but recently thats come into question. We originally agreed on Thomas Ike and Margaret (Maggie) May. There wasnt an inspiration behind either we just liked the names. 

So what changed? In January my grandfather died and while it was something we were expecting, it really rocked me. It made me think about how present he was in my life and how missed he is. Ive cried nearly every week since his death and it still hits me at random times and places. It really is such a strange thing to be grieving life while growing new life inside you. 

Due to this impact, I recently started thinking about changing our boy name to Thomas Lawrence Lawrence was my grandfathers middle name. I spoke to my husband about this thought and he said ultimately he would be on board if thats the route I want to move in but he feels like the recent grief is heavy on my heart and thats whats inspiring the name change. He is correct. But since the convo I really have no idea anymore. Ive sat on the question independently for about a month and still cant make up my mind. 

Im also worried because since Ive started telling people the names we have, that Ike is an atypical name. It normally makes people stop and question if we said Mike or just flat out misheard me. It makes me worry if we have a boy and I go with the original name that Im setting him up for a life of having to correct people.  

Should we change our boy name to Thomas Lawrence or keep the name as Thomas Ike?

I was told to come into triage, knowing that the contractions arent consistent. I have been having inconsistent contractions for about a week. They have been getting stronger but not consistent. I know they arent Braxton Hicks, because my Braxton Hicks were much different. I go in and they observe me for a bit and they tell me that they think they are just going to discharge me. They believe that this is early labor, but to go home and rest. They let me know its about shift change so a different resident will probably be discharging me. I say ok and wait for a while. This new resident comes in and says that Im getting a cervical exam. I havent gotten one yet, so I have no clue what its like. He explained that he finds it necessary if Im having contractions. He does the exam and says I am 4cm dilated. The nurse goes, no she cant be, she would be a lot more uncomfortable if so. She says that shed like to check. She does and she says Im about 1cm or possibly 2cm. He says he doesnt agree and asks to do another. He does and says that Im 1cm. He says that he must have put his hand on the wrong tissue. He leaves and the nurse asked whos hurt worse, and I told her, the residents did. Mind you I have a higher pain tolerance, and I wanted to cry. She explained that she thinks I would be in more discomfort if I was further along and she believes Im about 30% effaced and 1.5 cm dilated. She says that she believes that he did it wrong. She explained that she didnt have to go far to check and that baby is very far down. She then says shes going to give me the group b strep test. She leaves and comes back in and says they are going to see if Ive progressed at all in 2 hours, but she wont be there. She says that they saw pink discharge after so I should be aware of light spotting but thats all. I wait and get the second cervical check by the same male resident. It hurts almost more. He says that I have no change and that Im 1 cm and that Im going to be discharged and that its just round ligament pain. The other nurse there says that it could be early labor and to not worry and come back if its worse. At this point Im so uncomfortable. I am having horrible spotting and pain. I still 2 days later am having small spotting along with horrible pain and discomfort. Some sharp and some more cramping. I am still having inconsistent contractions. Was 4 cervical exams really necessary? Are they supposed to be this awful?

Im not too sure what to do here. Im at 20 weeks, so far everything has been great during this pregnancy, but it seems the last two weeks my health is going haywire. The baby is perfectly fine, which Im super happy about. 

Recently got diagnosed with GD at 18 weeks. My blood pressure recently has been elevated, 152/90 as of 3/14. Ive never had high blood pressure before. Last appointment (last week) was 140/60. And my heart rate wont rest below 113. My thyroid levels are also way off (had It removed a couple years ago due to cancer), which they think might be throwing off my heart rate. 

Ive been doing so good with the GD and diet and all that, but now the BP is another obstacle I need to figure out. I did the urine test early on and passed it so preeclampsia wasnt a worry. Theyre having me do it again to see if preeclampsia is now a factor. I dont have any hand or foot swelling and no headaches. 

Has anyone had to deal with GD and HBP during pregnancy? Was there anything you were able to do to help with the HBP? Im going to attempt to cut out a looooot of salt from my diet to see if that helps at all. Ive also only been drinking water since week 16 when I failed the one hour glucose test in case it became a concern later on.

EDIT: Anywhere I said Advil, Im not taking advil, its off brand Acetaminophen, I got my name brand drugs mixed up,

FTM (22) here, first knowledge of the pregnancy was an at home test, and we are super excited! Id been trying to find an ob/gyn to get scheduled into, but everyone's booked out till April. Cons of being in a town with no other hospitals for 3+ hours.

For a few weeks, id been having terrible right side cramping, enough to bring me to tears in the middle of the night, and overall soreness in my abdomen. After about two weeks, my husband finally forced me to go to the ER to make sure it wasn't ectopic, my appendix, or some other thing. After an ultra sound, the tech looking confused, and two much more in depth ones, they determined I have two endometrial horns? The doc wasn't too entirely sure, but she said that I have a yolk sack w/ no fetal pole in my right horn, and ""small nonspecific fluid or hemorrhage within the left endometrial horn"", along with my right ovary being 2.6x1.9x2.6, and my left one being 4.1x2.1x3.2.

The docs seemed a little concerned, and gave my pregnancy a 50% viability, and wanted me to come back for a repeat quantitative HCG in 48-72 hours, and wanted another ultrasound in 1 week. I was also put on strict pelvic precautions, with no heavy lifting. They referred me to an OB/GYN in branch and sent me on my way.

We came back 3 days later to do the repeat test, and they didn't put in a lab, no one there knew anything about it, they said that was something for my OB to schedule. The only scheduling I can get anywhere close to the ob is with a nurse practitioner New Patient appointment in two weeks. They'll only check my vitals and get me into the system as a patient, a 15 min appointment. I wont even be able to see a doctor. The one they referred me to was on maternity leave, and the only doctor with any slots open was available for mid April, but I cant be scheduled for that at all until my new patient. I cant get in for an ultrasound unless I go back to the ER and check myself in again, or I wait till April to get myself seen by an ob and assessed.

I'm still in a lot of pain, its been about a week calling all over town and even to other towns, and no one can seem to squeeze me in. I cant really sit comfortably, and I don't know if this is normal cramping and I'm being dramatic or what, but work isn't helping me out either. The ER nurse wrote my precautions on my discharge papers, and gave me a note for work, but they ""don't take doctors notes"" and are trying to argue that pushing and pulling carts is ""not lifting because its PUSHING, duh"". I feel like I'm about to pass out on my shifts, but I don't want to go back to the ER just to be told the exact same thing.

Is first trimester usually this rough? I know the vomiting and the tiredness are normal, I can hardly keep anything down and I sleep for 20 hours a day on my days off, but I just cant shake the feeling that somethings fundamentally wrong. I'm taking Advil, but I'm afraid of taking too much, I've always been an anti drugs (for me) kinda person, and its always been ibuprofen that's worked better for me anyways. Independent practices are just as booked up, and I cant de-stress when I'm hurting this much and worried about the baby being okay. Am I doing something wrong, am I missing something?

The end of the night is very foggy. I woke up the next day and had one of the worst hangovers Ive ever had. I decided to take a pregnancy test and got the faintest line Ive ever seen. I would have been 3w1d. 

I am 4 weeks today and everything seems to be ok but I cannot stop worrying that Ive caused this baby lasting harm. Would love any anecdotes of people in similar situations that have gone on to have a healthy pregnancy/baby. Thanks so much in advance!

my husband and i had been trying for about 7 months. we had a blissfully happy first year of marriage before deciding to try. and everything about our story felt perfect. we had been in mexico days before my birthday having the holiday of our lives (pregnant all along!) and then finding out on my birthday was the most amazing gift. i am obviously beside myself. but i dont want this to be my story. i am generally a positive and resilient person. i struggle with depression so i have to be. i cant let myself back slide or sink. i want to be strong for myself, for my husband (who is just as affected by this loss as i am, i believe that) and my step son. who i have worked so hard with to have a beautiful, loving relationship. 

i need help. i woke up this morning wanting to feel happy it happened instead of sad its over. i feel robbed of the beautiful story, the first baby, the milestones and moments i was looking forward to. i dont know what else to say, im just looking for some sympathy and words of wisdom and encouragement to take on this day with my family feeling joy, gratitude, and hope. =",pregnant,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jcga4o/reframing_my_loss/

 I'm both extremely excited about this baby and incredibly nervous. Me and my fiancé always thought it would be at least two years until this happens, as we've been using condoms combined with FAM for contraception for ages. To add to that, exactly around the time I was ovulating I was sick with the flu and by the time I felt better and up for fooling around it had been 24 hours since I ovulated so we thought we were safe. So it's an unexpected pregnancy, but we're not mad about it.
We're anxious as we're just finishing up university this summer. He's been working part time for a year already and he's going to go full time as soon as we're done with our thesis, but we're worried about money a little bit. We do have a place to live where we don't pay rent so that's sorted.
We're also scared about our families' reactions as we really don't know how they'll take the news when we decide to share.

Hey yall&.let me start off with this. I know a lot of pregnancies dont have bad things happen during them. 

I (22 F), and my fiancé (23 M), have been talking about children and how many we want and how we want to raise them since forever. Weve been together since I was 18. 

But, Ive started thinking.  What if my pregnancy doesnt go as planned? Theres sooooo many things that could go wrong bc of&well everything. Im terrified of the idea of getting pregnant. Im scared. I want a baby with my spouse so badly though within the next year or two. But Im terrified. What if I fail my baby? What if I miscarry. What if baby grows incorrectly or they are born with a disability (Id still love them dw). What if they grow outside of the womb? What if&&the list goes on and on and on. 


And Ive thought about it all. I miscarried (BD killed it) at 16. Ive talked to my OGBYN and asked if she thought I was infertile because of this. She said she doubts it. Also. My fiancé made a joke the other day. That he would freaking leave me if I was infertile. Now Im even more scared. 


How would he handle it if I gave birth to an unhealthy baby. Or if I have issues with miscarrying babies? My grandmother miscarried a baby boy before my mom was born. Im so scared. I just dont know. Id be devastated if I just couldnt&have children. Also the world we are in today scares me just as much. I was talking with finance about it. Especially about a baby girl. I had a really hard childhood. I had an alcoholic abusive father. I was SA multiple times by multiple men. I was almost trafficked. I have been attacked, I went through substance abuse. I got in a bad crowd. Stuffed with mental health and still do. 

Am I overthinking all of this? Like I feel like I have every reason to fear the future. But also. The joy a child would bring to my life would be immense. Ive always dreamed of having a big family and being a mother. But&..what if it doesnt go as planned? I just dont know. I know that yall may laugh at this. But its a genuine fear.

I was overweight before I got pregnant. Now I'm 30lbs heavier and I don't wanna type out just how big I am cause of how ashamed I am. 
I have genuinely not changed my calorie intake from pre-pregnancy and I think that's what's so frustrating to me. I eat the same portions, and haven't had intense cravings or anything along those lines. But I'm still gaining weight. 

The big problem is up until 3 weeks ago, my blood pressure was normal! No issues whatsoever. I monitor it at home and at the doc appts of course. Now, at 30 weeks pregnant it is high and stressing me out. 140s/80s. 

On top of that I have failed both 1 hr glucose tests I was given by 10mg and even though I already passed my first 3 hr glucose test, I have to go in for a 2nd one tomorrow. I'm terrified of failing it. 

The rational part of me knows that this is related to the pregnancy but I keep hearing stories of women who started getting high blood pressure during pregnancy and it never went away and now they've been on meds for 10+ years. 

But I'm scared of what gestational diabetes AND high blood pressure may result in for me and my baby in these final weeks. 

I'm soooo tired all the time and can barely walk without being winded.  Where as before I was actually pretty active for a plus size girl.

I need to make changes but it all seems like no matter if I do, it's not going to be good enough this late in the game.

2025-03-15,1742070086.0,"Do Women Have a Moral Duty to Keep Their Bodies ""Ready"" for Reproduction at All Times?","Late last year, Dr. Rebecca Gomperts (Aid Access, Women on Waves) announced results of a large clinical trial in Moldova, testing the use of a weekly low dose of mifepristone (50 mg) as a contraceptive. The results were promising, with only one pregnancy occurring within 2000 cycles. Furthermore, negative side effects were minimal, with only 4% of the participants experiencing any negative side effects (compared to a 40% negative side effect rate for conventional hormonal contraceptives). Additionally, the low-dose mifepristone was easier to use, requiring only one dose a week, and being more ""forgiving"" of variations in the time the pill is taken. And 89% of the study participants reported that they stopped menstruating while taking mifepristone as a contraceptive. (Probably most women would consider this a positive side effect.)

Because of the positive results, the trials have been expanded to the Netherlands this year. If the results continue to be positive, the plan is to apply to the European Medicines Agency for registration and market authorization to allow this weekly, low-dose mifepristone regimen as a contraceptive throughout the EU.

The method of action for mifepristone as birth control is two-fold: it reduces the rate of ovulation and it thins the endometrial lining of the uterus, making it impossible for a fertilized egg to implant.

([Source](https://msmagazine.com/2025/01/07/mifepristone-weekly-contraceptive-clinical-trials-abortion-pill-birth-control/).)

My primary question for PL supporters is this: 

* Would you have any moral or legal objections to women's use of such a contraceptive? If so, on what grounds?

Here are some secondary questions if you believe that the use of this contraceptive would be immoral:

* If a woman was taking mifepristone as described here *as a contraceptive* and informed her partner that she was doing this before they had sex, and if her partner, knowing this, decided to go ahead and have PIV sex with her, and if one of his sperm fertilized an egg but it failed to implant, whose would be the primary responsibility for the ""death"" of the fertilized egg? (Realistically, neither of them would ever know if this happened, so this is a hypothetical question.)
* *Men's* use of tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, red meat, and food high in trans fats during the months before their partners' conception is associated with higher miscarriage rates, because of these substances' impacts on sperm. ([Source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/a-mans-unhealthy-lifestyle-too-can-lead-to-his-partners-pregnancy-loss/articleshow/64072130.cms?from=mdr).)  If men engage in such unhealthy lifestyles, they are not maintaining their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction, and their choices could result in the ""death"" of a fertilized egg or even an embryo or fetus. Do they have a moral duty to maintain their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction by refraining from such lifestyle choices?",Abortiondebate,56.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jc47ep/do_women_have_a_moral_duty_to_keep_their_bodies/

Unfortunately, she began having intense bleeding a few days ago (at around 6 weeks). We went to the hospital, worrying that it might be ectopic. They did an ultrasound and could barely see the gestational sac. They couldnt visualize a yolk or pole. They told us she was 5 weeks and 3 days pregnant by the imaging and that her HCG levels were relatively low for 6 weeks (around 830). They told us that the bleeding indicated that shes likely miscarrying. She had intense bleeding and was releasing clots for the last few days, but its just spotting now. Her pregnancy symptoms kind of just went away. All of these signs made us think that she already passed the tissue. 

Today, we went for a follow up with her ob-gyn and the sac wasnt just there, but it got larger. The yolk was a bit more visualized today although no embryo was seen. She couldnt see the pole. We were so confused but the doctor said that shes 99.9% sure that shes going to pass the tissue anyway. They took her bloodwork today as well to get some more insight. 

Now, my concern is two fold: 
1) is it likely that she wont be able to pass the tissue herself? What happens then? If the sac is still present and its growing, what does that mean? Is it a blighted ovum? 

2) is there any scientifically reasonable chance shes still pregnant? We were very upset the last few days and my wife just got over the fact that she likely miscarried, but after the ultrasound today, were both in an even more anxious mood, worrying she hasnt passed the tissue.

2025-03-16,1742094446.0,CMV: Eugenics is being practiced in the USA right now and that is a good thing.,"The high rate of abortions following a Down syndrome screening sometimes exceeding 90% i can lead to a significant reduction in the prevalence of the condition. Resembling the effects of eugenics, it reflects a societal bias against disabilities, effectively ""weeding out"" a specific genetic trait.

Eugenics per wikipedia: is a set of beliefs and practices that aim to improve the genetic quality of a human population -&gt;This in itself seems a good ""improving genetic quality of the human population""

Eugenics is stigmatized due to the racist evils of Nazi Germany, but it's goal of improving a populations health and other desirable characteristics is not evil in it's self.

It will obviously need to be controlled but once we can select and screen fetuses and embryos for positive characteristics such as good health (e.g. not having mental or physical illnesses), long life, physical strength, intelligence that will improve society we should and it can be argued it would be immoral to the next generation not to do so e.g. we are treating them poorly

Once genetic selection becomes  a societal norm similar to  how immunizing a child is expected today, It will be seem negligent to opt out, much like skipping vaccines is viewed now.

  
TLDR:  
Downs syndrome screening is eugenics "" a set of beliefs and practices that aim to improve the genetic quality of a human population"".  
This itself is a good and is tainted by a history of racism and discrimination which doesn't need to apply to eugenics in future. Though obvious caution and safeguards should be applied

Outside of the sudden onset of blurred vision and all I have honestly had a lot less pregnancy symptoms this time as I did before. For example I had morning sickness the entire time with both of my boys but have felt fine this time. I'm just not understanding why this has happened twice now and I feel fine before it does happen...

Ive just hit 32 weeks and Ive had excruciating headaches all week. Saw my midwife and my bp was 133/82 so she said its not high enough to be a concern and to ring the gp for stronger pain meds. Paracetamol wont touch the headaches and no protein in urine either.
Woke up today to horrible nausea and now I cannot stop vomiting. Ive emptied the contents of my stomach and Ive even ran out of bile to throw up. Even the tiniest drop of water sets the vomiting off. 
If its a stomach bug will triage even see me or will they ask to me stay home away from people? Im worried Im going to get dehydrated.

2025-03-16,1742137469.0,"Those with severe nausea/vomiting that went away, was it gradual or sudden?","I hope I worded this correctly!

I'm currently 10w3d and experienced severe nausea and vomiting since about 5 weeks (6 weeks on the dot with the vomiting). I was given Reglan that improved it for a couple days before doing nothing at all besides give me shakiness in my muscles, so I stopped. I got to the point of throwing up about 3-5 times a day and always after a solid meal, went to the ER at 8 weeks because severe dehydration was causing my back and ab muscles to cramp so bad I legitimately thought I had an ectopic (I was also spotting a bit prior), they confirmed baby was progressing as expected with a strong heartbeat and textbook structure/size. They gave me a few days worth of Zofran but my doctor refused to refill because he hadn't seen me yet. Regardless, Zofran was effective for only most of those days but did not stop the puking altogether and the last day I had it, it felt like it did nothing. The nausea was getting worse so out of pure desperation I took the Reglan again and dealt with the unwanted symptoms.

I want to say my nausea peaked (so far) last Wednesday night, I threw up/dry heaved 9 times that day, had an absolute delirious mental episode and considered going to the ER before I eventually just passed out on my bed. Thursday hitting the 10 week mark, I felt *slightly* better but still puking. Friday, puked 3 times. Yesterday once, all acid though, but more bone tired than usual like it was a trade off- first time having solid food since Wednesday.  I never stopped actually being nauseous all day even throughout this. 

This morning my nausea resembled more hunger pains than an actual urge to puke. I feel far more lucid. I don't want to jinx myself, I've been fooled before, but I am at the moment feeling 80% more ""normal."" I've been warned about sudden ends to symptoms as something potentially bad, especially since I read that most people reach their peak nausea symptoms around 10 weeks *if* it's a first trimester thing only, and lasting until 12-14 weeks. 

I guess I'm just looking for a peace of mind. I'm not even sure if I should really call my current symptoms progression as a gradual improvement since the nausea never wavered until literally just this morning. I'm holding on the hope that my boobs are still sore and I'm still sluggish that maybe this is actually a good sign and not something to be concerned about.

I get my first scan Thursday so I really won't know anything until then.

I stopped working a few weeks ago and I just feel really overwhelmed by my house right now and I always see the ""nesting"" that should be happening while I'm on my maternity leave but it hasn't happened. I definitely had a burst of energy in the 2nd trimester, did some organizing and got the nursery exactly how I wanted but that energy is long gone now.

Most days I wake up still tired because I don't sleep well throughout the night. I get back spasms pretty often, swollen feet and ankles, all the normal stuff.. especially the more time I spend up doing things. Bending over can be very uncomfortable and I fell a few weeks ago so I have a lot of anxiety about tripping and falling again. (I did land on my hands and knees but it was scary in the moment for sure.)

I know my husband is doing everything he can, we own businesses together so me not being there means he hasn't had a day off in weeks. My father in law will be in town around time of our due date to be able to relieve him but for now, he's just a bit bogged down and I can tell it's definitely impacting him although he never complains. He's wants me to rest, not overdo it too much but I'm genuinely getting anxious about the house. 

Clothing is piling up, I mean to fold and put it away but keep either falling asleep or just generally can't be bothered most of the time. I get the dishwasher ran as much as possible too, but I have 3 dogs and have been having a hard time keeping up with everything. I cleaned the bathroom out really well yesterday when I had a little energy but ended up having a back spasm from the bending over and felt exhausted the rest of the day. 

It makes me just feel lazy most of them time, mostly because i have been... The nursery is completely done, glad I got it done earlier in the pregnancy but it feels like the rest of the house is in disarray and it's making me so anxious. This is my first child so I don't know what to expect and fear I won't have the time or energy when baby comes to be able to handle it either. It's just kinda bumming me out i guess.

I'm 9 weeks today. Supposedly. 
I'm freaking out constantly that maybe it's already gone. 
This is my third pregnancy, the first made it to 8 weeks but didn't develop past 7. Ended in a d&amp;c. The second made it to 7 and had a miscarriage on my own but I knew it was coming because my blood work wasn't great. 
This one I found out about on Valentine's. I'm not going to lie the timing couldn't be worse, 2 weeks after my due date is my brother's wedding that my husband is the best man in, I'm in the bridal party, and it's all happening at my parents house 4 hours away. But I still want this so bad. 
My husband is very encouraging and says we will keep trying as long as it takes but I'm 37. 
I have two different doctors, my normal gyno doesn't do babies anymore so she recommended my OB. I haven't seen the OB this pregnancy yet, I'm supposed to have an appointment this Wednesday and an ultrasound Thursday. I'm now freaking out because I went to look at the times and they're not showing up in the app anymore so if they got cancelled I'm going to cry. 
My normal gyno ordered blood work Feb 19 that was great and an ultrasound on Feb 26th that was also right on track. 
But I am not having morning sickness at all, maybe I'm just lucky. My breasts are tender and I'm extra gassy and very emotional and tired. But that's all my symptoms. It's making me so nervous. I keep wanting to like just keep taking pregnancy tests or something. How do you get over not knowing if it's ok or not? 
Like eventually they move and stuff so I imagine that will be reassuring. But if it's still there this is the furthest I've ever been but I just don't know if it's still there. 
I'm so sorry this is just a ramble. My Brain is fried, my therapist is out of town for a few weeks, I'm having a time haha.

2025-03-16,1742122119.0,Emotional Rollercoaster,"**TLDR:** ***Ive had a lot of physical, emotional, and mentally challenging issues during my pregnancy; and really need some advice or reassurance. If you can share anything, please do. Im sorry its so long, I tried to trim everything down but theres just so much.***

My pregnancy has been more of an emotional rollercoaster than I even thought it could be. Im currently due June 2nd, and Im not sure what all to expect with the last couple months. 

In the first half of my pregnancy, I was diagnosed with HG and was throwing up constantly and unable to keep food or medication down, resulting in me losing around thirty pounds within the first trimester. It was incredibly hard for me and my husband. If I hadnt known I was pregnant I wouldve thought I had cancer or some serious illness. 

We were waiting to tell our families in person, but we live out of state. Just before we went to see them we had our first ultrasound, and got to see the baby for the very first time. It was incredible, and breathtaking. It made it all feel so worth it. I was so glad to see my sickness wasnt effecting him like I was worried it was. 

We finally got to tell our families we were pregnant around week 14, for Thanksgiving. It was absolutely beautiful, and something Ill remember the rest of my life.

Immediately following Thanksgiving, I got incredibly sick, on top of my HG situation. Some sort of respiratory sickness they couldnt put a name on, and couldnt give me medication for at first. For one week, I really thought I was going to die I was so ill. On top of the HG, I couldnt breathe, had severe chest pains that I even went to the ER for because I got so scared, was coughing so hard it made me cry and vomit. It was so painful. I had a mental breakdown, and truly thought the baby might not make it. They ended up finally giving me medication to help at least a little. It took another week to feel like it was getting better.

I was able to get a couple of days at work that week. I had been missing most days of work for two months. I came home on December 12th, and my beloved kitty got her wings that night. It was my first true loss, and it was really hard. 

That next week we found out that we are having a boy, and getting to share the news with family and my husband is something I will cherish forever. It was so wonderful. 

Over Christmas, my HG finally seemed to be letting up. It was amazing. I ate food for the first time in months that wasnt rice or bread. We stayed home instead of seeing family because it had made me so so sick last time, and to spend time with our other pets. It was beautiful, and it even snowed a tiny bit.

Come new years, my HG was back, but my belly was starting to show and we had gotten to see him on ultrasound again. I tried to push through and make it to work. My boss pulled me aside and told me that I whod been missing too much, even with everything going on. That they understood, but if I missed or called out one more day within 8 weeks they would take me to part time and cut my benefits. They acted like I was just staying home because I wanted to and not because I was horribly sick. We were running out of our savings, it wasnt like I didnt need to be there, I couldnt. Adding an entire new stress to my situation. 

We get our 20 week anatomy scan mid January. They were unable to see his face, with his arms up, and needed to get another scan soon to try to check for cleft. They are unable to see his heart fully. They tell me they also saw what may be a tumor is his brain, and will check it again next time. At this point theyve been taking blood and urine samples every time I come in. My white blood cell count is double what it should be and had been that way since I got sick at Thanksgiving. They let me know they are sending me to a specialist but not to worry. I am definitely worried for my little guy.

They schedule me a few more weeks out for another ultrasound. I try to make it to work, as Im in fear of losing my benefits so close to birth. Im throwing up multiple times a day and having to leave my desk constantly. Theyre upset Im not able to grab someone to cover the desk on my way to run to the restroom to vomit. Theyre upset I seem sick, tired, and on the verge of tears at the front desk. Not a good look for them. Exactly why Ive been staying home. 

They got my results back and tell me I might have small kidney stones and to drink a ton of water to try to flush them out. Super easy request seeing as Im still throwing up multiple times a day. 

The specialist is an oncologist. They are watching me to see if I have leukemia. Didnt know that until I literally am sitting in the oncologist office, and shes the one to tell me why Im there. I get they didnt want me to worry. But Im starting to feel like Im falling apart.

Im finally feeling his kicks and movements. Its bringing me a lot of peace, and its so wonderful to feel like hes okay in there. We get our ultrasound and no tumor, no cleft and no heart defect. thank God. We started getting stuff for the nursery and putting things together. The HG is getting lighter. Only a few days a week Im throwing up. I feel like I can truly see the beautiful light at the end of the tunnel.

I developed this cyst in my right breast, that grew from a dime size to about the size of a clementine, and was so incredibly painful. It got red and swollen until it was purple. Again they didnt want to give me antibiotics and there was nothing I could do but put a compress on. I couldnt even wear a bra. I had to keep going to work or they would drop my benefits. Eventually the cyst burst on its own and all this puss came out. It drained for three days. They had to express it further and finally put me on antibiotics. I had that open wound on my breast for about a week, and kept having to rewrap it, to the point the tape was tearing little parts of my skin off. But it did finally heal. 

This past week, Tuesday I wake up with some sort of respiratory situation again. My throat is so sore I cant swallow and have a fever. They still want me to come into work, so I do. 

We woke up Wednesday morning to my beloved dog Sam having some neurological symptoms, and we had to lay her to rest on Wednesday. After thirteen beautiful years. This is the hardest thing Ive ever been through. 

I try to go to work Thursday, but I was so broken I just left. I told my boss I couldnt be here, I couldnt even think. Theyre probably going to fire me. I dont even care anymore. I cant deal with all of this. Im now so incredibly sick, coughing things up, sore throat, drainage etc; if I could, I wouldnt go in to work tomorrow either. 

Please: I need some advice. Any advice. If you been through a rough pregnancy or grieving while going through this, please let me know how you made it. I feel like Im trying my best to keep my head held high but its one thing after another, like waves crashing down on my head and I cant catch my breath.

EDIT: Anywhere I said Advil, Im not taking advil, its off brand Acetaminophen, I got my name brand drugs mixed up,

FTM (22) here, first knowledge of the pregnancy was an at home test, and we are super excited! Id been trying to find an ob/gyn to get scheduled into, but everyone's booked out till April. Cons of being in a town with no other hospitals for 3+ hours.

For a few weeks, id been having terrible right side cramping, enough to bring me to tears in the middle of the night, and overall soreness in my abdomen. After about two weeks, my husband finally forced me to go to the ER to make sure it wasn't ectopic, my appendix, or some other thing. After an ultra sound, the tech looking confused, and two much more in depth ones, they determined I have two endometrial horns? The doc wasn't too entirely sure, but she said that I have a yolk sack w/ no fetal pole in my right horn, and ""small nonspecific fluid or hemorrhage within the left endometrial horn"", along with my right ovary being 2.6x1.9x2.6, and my left one being 4.1x2.1x3.2.

The docs seemed a little concerned, and gave my pregnancy a 50% viability, and wanted me to come back for a repeat quantitative HCG in 48-72 hours, and wanted another ultrasound in 1 week. I was also put on strict pelvic precautions, with no heavy lifting. They referred me to an OB/GYN in branch and sent me on my way.

We came back 3 days later to do the repeat test, and they didn't put in a lab, no one there knew anything about it, they said that was something for my OB to schedule. The only scheduling I can get anywhere close to the ob is with a nurse practitioner New Patient appointment in two weeks. They'll only check my vitals and get me into the system as a patient, a 15 min appointment. I wont even be able to see a doctor. The one they referred me to was on maternity leave, and the only doctor with any slots open was available for mid April, but I cant be scheduled for that at all until my new patient. I cant get in for an ultrasound unless I go back to the ER and check myself in again, or I wait till April to get myself seen by an ob and assessed.

I'm still in a lot of pain, its been about a week calling all over town and even to other towns, and no one can seem to squeeze me in. I cant really sit comfortably, and I don't know if this is normal cramping and I'm being dramatic or what, but work isn't helping me out either. The ER nurse wrote my precautions on my discharge papers, and gave me a note for work, but they ""don't take doctors notes"" and are trying to argue that pushing and pulling carts is ""not lifting because its PUSHING, duh"". I feel like I'm about to pass out on my shifts, but I don't want to go back to the ER just to be told the exact same thing.

Is first trimester usually this rough? I know the vomiting and the tiredness are normal, I can hardly keep anything down and I sleep for 20 hours a day on my days off, but I just cant shake the feeling that somethings fundamentally wrong. I'm taking Advil, but I'm afraid of taking too much, I've always been an anti drugs (for me) kinda person, and its always been ibuprofen that's worked better for me anyways. Independent practices are just as booked up, and I cant de-stress when I'm hurting this much and worried about the baby being okay. Am I doing something wrong, am I missing something?

I would like to wait until the 2nd trimester to tell friends and co-workers (immediate family knows already) and I want to do a fun &amp; thoughtful announcement, which takes time to arrange. He got pissed because he feels like he is lying to his employees when he is at my appointments with me and can't be direct about where he is going &amp; why he will be away from the office for a couple of hours. I don't get why it's particularly his employees' business any way whether it's due to my appointments or any other personal reason. He doesn't owe his private doings to anyone so idk why of all things, this sets him over the edge. To me it's a big fucking deal to announce this pregnancy &amp; I don't want it casually floating amongst a few people and having other friends find out second-hand and not from us. That's the last thing I want to happen.

2025-03-15,1742070086.0,"Do Women Have a Moral Duty to Keep Their Bodies ""Ready"" for Reproduction at All Times?","Late last year, Dr. Rebecca Gomperts (Aid Access, Women on Waves) announced results of a large clinical trial in Moldova, testing the use of a weekly low dose of mifepristone (50 mg) as a contraceptive. The results were promising, with only one pregnancy occurring within 2000 cycles. Furthermore, negative side effects were minimal, with only 4% of the participants experiencing any negative side effects (compared to a 40% negative side effect rate for conventional hormonal contraceptives). Additionally, the low-dose mifepristone was easier to use, requiring only one dose a week, and being more ""forgiving"" of variations in the time the pill is taken. And 89% of the study participants reported that they stopped menstruating while taking mifepristone as a contraceptive. (Probably most women would consider this a positive side effect.)

Because of the positive results, the trials have been expanded to the Netherlands this year. If the results continue to be positive, the plan is to apply to the European Medicines Agency for registration and market authorization to allow this weekly, low-dose mifepristone regimen as a contraceptive throughout the EU.

The method of action for mifepristone as birth control is two-fold: it reduces the rate of ovulation and it thins the endometrial lining of the uterus, making it impossible for a fertilized egg to implant.

([Source](https://msmagazine.com/2025/01/07/mifepristone-weekly-contraceptive-clinical-trials-abortion-pill-birth-control/).)

My primary question for PL supporters is this: 

* Would you have any moral or legal objections to women's use of such a contraceptive? If so, on what grounds?

Here are some secondary questions if you believe that the use of this contraceptive would be immoral:

* If a woman was taking mifepristone as described here *as a contraceptive* and informed her partner that she was doing this before they had sex, and if her partner, knowing this, decided to go ahead and have PIV sex with her, and if one of his sperm fertilized an egg but it failed to implant, whose would be the primary responsibility for the ""death"" of the fertilized egg? (Realistically, neither of them would ever know if this happened, so this is a hypothetical question.)
* *Men's* use of tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, red meat, and food high in trans fats during the months before their partners' conception is associated with higher miscarriage rates, because of these substances' impacts on sperm. ([Source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/a-mans-unhealthy-lifestyle-too-can-lead-to-his-partners-pregnancy-loss/articleshow/64072130.cms?from=mdr).)  If men engage in such unhealthy lifestyles, they are not maintaining their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction, and their choices could result in the ""death"" of a fertilized egg or even an embryo or fetus. Do they have a moral duty to maintain their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction by refraining from such lifestyle choices?",Abortiondebate,56.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jc47ep/do_women_have_a_moral_duty_to_keep_their_bodies/

As background for me, I had a MMC last year. I was measuring about 2 1/2 weeks behind, and ultimately had an anembryonic pregnancy. My HCG took about a month to come down to baseline, and I got pregnant again a little under 2 months after my miscarriage.

I had my blood drawn on 3/6, when I was around 10w2d. I had the QNATAL Advanced test through Quest Diagnostics. My results came in today, 3/15, meaning I had a 9 day turnaround time for my results.

* My fetal fraction was 19.39%.
* My results showed no abnormalities, and I tested negative for all tested trisomies.

2025-03-16,1742101915.0,I think Im having a miscarriage. Help please,"Hello,

Im going to give a detailed account of my experience. I may share unnecessary information, but thats because I dont know much about pregnancy or miscarriages.

Im 35. This is my first pregnancy. I removed my IUD 6 months ago but only last month my partner and I checked when was my fertile period and then had sex multiple times around that time.

We were very surprised I got pregnant. It felt easy, since it was the first time we really tried.  It felt very unexpected.

I discovered the pregnancy 5 days ago, and that should have been when it was a little less than 4 weeks long.

The miscarriage:
Day 1: 2 days ago I had some very brown discharge, what look exactly like what I get a day before my period. Later that day I got a little more and what looked like some very dark blood. The quantities seem small, not enough to fill a pad, but also seem a bit more than what I read that was normal to happen. I was supposed to be in the implantation phase.

Together with that I felt constant but very mild cramps. No other pains. I tested again to make sure I was pregnant. I had 3 positive tests already.

Day 2: I had very mild cramps also most of the day, and some very brown discharge in the morning. Maybe enough to cover half of a panty protector type of pad, those small ones.

Day 3: I woke up early this morning feeling still really mild cramps. When I went to pee I noticed very little drops of very dark or brown blood, like spotting, on the toilet paper. A couple drops in the toilet water. 

This is the entire situation. This doesnt look good at all, but I also didnt had any red, or mid period like blood coming out. The tiny cramps feel like something is cooking in my uterus, in a bad way. 

I honestly still dont feel like I had a miscarriage, but all the facts point towards the high chance that its already on the way. Mostly because I seem to have had 4x a higher volume of spotting than the usual, and these damn constant, often hard to notice cramps. Sometimes I feel like Im imagining them because I focus so much at that part of my back.

I am okay (as much as one can be) with the possibility of having a first miscarriage. I know how common these are, they happened so much around me already. And Im honestly already so relieved that my partner and I can conceive. My struggle now is not knowing for sure that the pregnancy is gone. Between the first spotting and then several hours without any spotting yesterday, I went from being almost sure it was going to be a loss to hopeful that maybe that was just the implantation symptoms. Maybe I was spotting more than usual because I do get very heavy period the first 2 days of a period.

Anyway, I of course tried to reach out to a doctor on Friday, when this first started, but couldnt get a hold of one. If anyone here lives in the Netherlands, youll know the struggle.

And I know nobody - other than doctors - can really tell me what is happening for sure, but I would still like to kindly ask for anyone who has similar experiences to share any information that you believe may help me.

And to anyone going through a miscarriage, I hope you have the support of people you love. For what I can tell so far, thats the most important. 

Thank you,

I'm freaking out constantly that maybe it's already gone. 
This is my third pregnancy, the first made it to 8 weeks but didn't develop past 7. Ended in a d&amp;c. The second made it to 7 and had a miscarriage on my own but I knew it was coming because my blood work wasn't great. 
This one I found out about on Valentine's. I'm not going to lie the timing couldn't be worse, 2 weeks after my due date is my brother's wedding that my husband is the best man in, I'm in the bridal party, and it's all happening at my parents house 4 hours away. But I still want this so bad. 
My husband is very encouraging and says we will keep trying as long as it takes but I'm 37. 
I have two different doctors, my normal gyno doesn't do babies anymore so she recommended my OB.

I'm now freaking out because I went to look at the times and they're not showing up in the app anymore so if they got cancelled I'm going to cry. 
My normal gyno ordered blood work Feb 19 that was great and an ultrasound on Feb 26th that was also right on track.

2025-03-16,1742140819.0,Boyfriend forced me to have an abortion &amp; dumped me 2 days later,"I feel so lost, and I dont know how to move forward. My (now) ex-boyfriend pressured me into having an abortion, making me feel like I had no choice. The concerns over the extent of his forcefulness &amp; controlling behaviour were also logged at the time by the medical professionals at the abortion clinic. Two days later, he dumped me over text, told me he never wants to have children with me completely cut me off, and within two weeks, he was posting date night pictures with someone new, as I lay in bed still recovering physically &amp; mentally. He has a narcissistic mother that also blocked me on the day of my surgery and never even acknowledged that I was pregnant. Its just them two, his father is not around &amp; has a completely new family. Its like they both erased me and my baby overnight.

The worst part isI regret it. I didnt want to go through with it, but I was made to feel like I had no choice. I would cancel consultations until he noticed I was doing that so he would start driving me there, I couldnt take the preparation pill for hours but the amount of force I had received, it made me feel like I would be in serious danger if I kept my baby. Now, Im left with this overwhelming grief that I dont know how to process. I feel like a part of me is missing, and I dont know if Ill ever forgive myself. Its hard to function normally when the pain is this heavy. Its been 3 weeks now and I havent eaten a full meal since the day before the surgery, Im signed off work due to my mental health, I dont have any friends as he completely isolated me, and I get no more than 3 hours sleep a night. 

What makes this even harder is that just 10 days before I conceived, I was told I was infertile. Because of my PCOS, one of my ovaries no longer works, and I was led to believe that getting pregnant naturally would be nearly impossible for me. So when I found out I was pregnant, it felt like a miraclesomething I never thought Id get the chance to experience. And now, knowing that I was forced into giving that up, without knowing if Ill ever get another chance, makes the grief even more unbearable.

2025-03-16,1742087777.0,Married and trying to make a joint decision,"i apologize in advance that I am not the best story-teller. I (28)F and my husband (26)M have been married 5 years and have 2 kids already. A boy and a girl. I never wanted more than that. ESPECIALLY with how difficult our youngest has been. I was supposed to be on the birth control patch but I messed up and put it on 48 hours late and now have found myself unexpectedly pregnant. When I first found out I went to my husband and told him bawling my eyes out because we both know we did not want this and let him bring up the option of abortion because we are in Texas, US. At first he seemed on board although, did seem a little emotional about it. (He is very emotional and I am very logical) I went ahead and bought the abortion pull online and had it shipped to a fedex pick-up in New Mexico (only an hour from me ) and picked it up without communicating that to him, but of course wasnt going to take the pills before talking to him one more time. I brought it up again and he said he had talked to a therapist (I had encouraged him to and sent him several therapists in our network) and said when he talked to the therapist, he said that it seemed we both wanted different things but he was just leaving it up to me so that way it didnt ruin our marriage. This is not how I thought he felt at ALL. I knew he felt a little guilt, but I thought he was onboard with my decision. Anyways, the therapist suggested we both write a pros and cons list for having the baby and sit down together and make sure this is a joint decision, which I agree with, but I worry this isnt going to get us anywhere closer to a joint decision and this is obviously a time sensitive situation. So far, my pros list has like 5 very superficial items and my cons list is 30 items long and very valid reasons. I guess I just need someone else to talk to about this. 

A few of my cons:
-I am so close to a huge promotion at my job and a 50% pay raise and I think being pregnant would stop this progression 
-I am the main caregiver for our kids now and I already feel overwhelmed as is. 
-We would have to put a 6 week old in daycare and Ive never had to leave an infant that soon and it gives me anxiety
-We would need a bigger car and I would want a bigger house and camper to accommodate 
-Our youngest is not potty trained and having to change 2 sets of diapers just stresses me out. 
-The world is built for families of 4
-We would be outnumbered. Which brings up a whole other list of things. 
-The world and economy is shit. (Need I say more?)
- We have no village
I could go on and on and on , but I wont 

My 5 pros which carry no real weight in my mind:
-A bigger family at holidays
-Someone for our youngest to play with
-My friend and I would be pregnant together
-I could have the natural birth I wanted with our 2nd
-I could get my tubes tied after since we will reach our deductible
-Special treatment when pregnant =

2025-03-16,1742127558.0,Post MA and I feel hopeless,"(Throwaway account! Sorry, english is not my first language, pardon my grammar lapses)

Had a successful MA yesterday. Process only took me 4 hours to pass my precious angel. The procedure didnt go very well and heres the context.

March 14,2025
- I asked my live-in partner if he can take a day off this weekend to help me with my MA. I explained and said sorry in advance if I ever sound demanding as this procedure is mentally and emotionally draining for me. He said yes, assured me that he would be there. I already took mifepristone at 11:30am. 
- Later that afternoon, he asked permission if he can report work to fulfill his duties as it was critical for him to decline (hes an engineer and I cant really understand how does his workload looks like on a daily basis) that he also needs to work on Sunday for rotational work. I also told him that I may not understand his workload, but I understand that he needs to focus at work, but the stress hes giving me is just unnecessary.
- As a response, I lashed out on him, voicing out my frustrations and he took it negatively and broke up with me as I was affecting his career.
- At that time, I was really disappointed that he cant fulfill his words.
- ADDITIONAL CONTEXT: 2024 I was at the hospital cause Im about to give birth to our first born, he left me at the hospital for the same reason.. WORK.. that they are understaffed and no one will shoulder his workload. My doctors and midwife even spoke to him to straighten up his priorities as Im in active labor, that they cant proceed with anything unless theres a guardian that can accommodate them if something happens to me, but ofc, as usual, he was really firm with his decision to prioritize his work over his partner. Im new in town and I barely even have friends to ask help with.

March 15 
- at 11:30am already took the first dose of misoprostol and it all came back to me, the abandonment, the neglect from the day I gave birth, and after childbirth, the paternity leave I gave him was just useless, later on I figure out that he didnt disclosed that I was pregnant to his company. And yes, he left me with child care after birth with minimal help as he told me, as he ALWAYS told me that I need to be self-sufficient. And yesterday, it all crashed down on me. The same reason I had to deal with from the times I asked him for help. So I decided to handle things on my own. I went through the process scared, anxious, paranoid and alone.
- He went to work in the morning and went home around 12pm to offer help but my mind is already dysregulated and already disconnected that I refused to receive any help from him. Then he got angry and started shouting and even throwing things inside our room while im actively going through the abortion. Even threatened to hit me but shouted in front of my face instead.
- I was still firm that Im not gonna accept any help from him, the amount of stress that hes giving me is just not helping. So I was left with my 1 year old, crying, doing tantrums while my body is shaking, painfully going through the process. He didnt even bother with child care so I can focus with my process. Idk, hes trying to help but not really helping, shit made me really confused at this point, but oh well, what can I do? I just continued the process with all the emotions that Im feeling. No one to talk to, just trying to seek comfort while watching tiktok clips. 
- 3pm, I was able to finish the procedure and was crying and breaking down for couple of hours after seeing my angel. 
- The next few hours I started bleeding heavily, passing big clots after and cramping so bad that ibuprofen didnt even help to minimize the pain. Fell asleep but woke up around 3am with severe cramping, passed another big clots until dawn. 
- I woke at 3am and I thought It was already done but he even messaged my only friend whos been there for me but was not pro-abortion, telling her that she should check on me as I was doing the abortion. Now my only friend already FOd me as it was against her ethics to tolerate this. I felt betrayed for what he did and disappointed with everything that I just want to die. My grief was beyond comprehension, I just dont understand anything anymore at this point.

March 16
- Post MA today, Im still somewhat heavily bleeding 1 1/2 pads within 2 hours, but I decided to go to the mall as if nothing happened, hoping I can pass out there and die, I was just nauseous and dizzy but still able to walk and even bought groceries for me and my 1 year old baby. 
- I broke down after eating, almost had a panic attack while lining up to the cashier cause I saw a pregnant woman being held by her husband/partner

I just got home and I broke down again. I cant do this anymore, this is just too much for me. My body is trembling and I feel cold. I just dont know how to push forward from here.

2025-03-16,1742147691.0,Medication Abortion - Positive Experience,"Hi all, 25F here, US/North Carolina. I was absolutely terrified to go through with my MA this weekend so I wanted to share my experience in case it helps someone else. 

Some background, I was 5-6 weeks pregnant for my abortion and I am prone to extremely bad menstrual cramps for my normal period, which made me really scared to go through with the misoprostol. In North Carolina, you have to go through a consent appointment 72 hours prior to the abortion, so I did that at a local clinic. It was a bizarre experience where I had an ultrasound, light bloodwork, and counseling (if you can even call it that). 

On Friday I took the mifepristone at the clinic in a room of like 6 other women. I had little to no side effects from the mifepristone, other than emotional effects. I took Naproxen instead of Ibuprofen because it works much better for me, so I started that on Friday. Yesterday I took two rounds of misoprostol (8 pills total). Dissolving them in my mouth was definitely unpleasant but not a huge deal, made my gums kind of sore after. I started cramping within 20-30 minutes and started bleeding about an hour after starting the pills. I took Naproxen an hour before starting the first round and Zofran right before. I prepped with period underwear (dont skip out on this part!) and overnight pads. I had 2 heating pads, one that wraps around my back and one for the front. 

Like I mentioned, my menstrual cramps are horrific normally (Ive taken toradol injections at urgent care for the pain before) and my periods are very heavy (8 days long) so I was worried my abortion pain would be proportional to that, but luckily with the Naproxen and heating pads, it was comparable to a bad period for me. You should definitely prepare to be as sedentary as possible (I found that moving around made the cramps and nausea worse). If you can have someone with you to support you and get anything you need, its a huge help. 

I passed the pregnancy about 4 hours after the first round which is about when I started the second round of misoprostol. I made sure to eat something and drink electrolyte drinks before the second round because the nausea and stomach cramps were pretty bad. I had some diarrhea as well. By the second round of misoprostol, I had already passed the largest clots and it was just a lot of bleeding by that point. I used about 5-6 overnight pads the first night. Make sure you have a heating pad with an automatic timer/shut off so you can go to sleep with it on. I made sure to take another Naproxen before I went to bed at about midnight. Unfortunately, for some reason 12am-3am was kind of the worst of the pain for me, idk if it was the stomach cramps and nausea or what but that was the hardest part, but still not the worst pain Ive ever experienced. By the time I woke up in the morning, the worst of it was over and I didnt need any pain meds anymore. Im still having mild cramping today but overall it had not been NEARLY as bad as I expected. I expected to be crying all night from the pain, but I never got to that point. Here are the items I found most helpful:
- Period underwear
- Thick overnight pads
- Electrolyte drinks (hydration will help your nausea) 
- Wrap around heating pad with automatic shut off timer
- Zofran/anti nausea medication and pain medication that works best for you
- Popsicles and Italian ices (the cold helped my nausea)
- Applesauce and rice (to be able to take the meds) 
- All the distraction items you might need. Video games, books, movies chosen beforehand, etc. 

My DMs are open if anyone has questions about my experience or needs to vent. This was one of the hardest things Ive ever had to go through so Im happy to help you through it.

2025-03-16,1742130618.0,Cramping on left side 3 weeks after medical abortion,"Hey guys, I need some advice. About 3 weeks ago I had a medical abortion at 6 weeks pregnant. I ordered the pills online, it's my second abortion so I didn't go to a doctor, also just for the simple fact that I have state insurance and it's very hard to find a provider around me that covers the cost of an abortion.

But for the last 2 days, I have had cramping that is specifically on my left side. It radiates to my hip and I can feel it in my leg, butt and back as well. It feels just a tad bit more intense than my normal period cramps but nothing crazy. My bleeding has started lightening up over the past day or 2, but this cramping has just been so consistent over the past 2 days that I'm starting to worry. Last night I decided to take a pregnancy test just to make sure that my hcg levels were going down, but it still came back very positive.

I can say that I did see the sac come out when I had my abortion, so I know that my body dispelled SOMETHING. All of my bleeding was normal and everything had passed. I guess I'm just concerned about a potential ectopic pregnancy? I've never experienced one so I'm not sure what that pain would feel like. The cramping just feels very odd, especially for how directed it is in my left side and it's not just a general cramping feeling in my uterus.

Just figured i'd post on here and ask if anyone has experienced anything like this before taking myself over to the ER to get an ultrasound done....",abortion,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jcl3oj/cramping_on_left_side_3_weeks_after_medical/
2025-03-16,1742136839.0,Abortion is Absolutely Justified,"Premises:

1. Moral worth is based on current capacity for sentience, as **only sentient beings can experience harm**.

2. A pre-sentient fetus **lacks the ability to experience harm** and has no present interests.

3. Forcing a sentient person to remain pregnant **imposes significant physical, psychological, and emotional harm**.

4. Future potential does not create present moral worth; moral status depends on actual characteristics, **not hypothetical ones**.

5. When a **moral conflict** arises, the entity capable of experiencing harm (the pregnant person) has **greater moral weight** than a non-sentient fetus.

Conclusion:

Before fetal sentience, abortion is morally justified because **there is no meaningful harm to the fetus**, while forcing pregnancy **significantly harms a sentient person**.

2025-03-16,1742089792.0,What are my options to join the church without husband due to his previous marriage?,"The title is weird, but let me explain. My husband is my first and only marriage and we've been married for almost 21 years now. I am my husband's second marriage. Neither of us are officially Catholic but have been worshipping and living our lives according to the Catholic church's teaching for many years now. Here is my question.   
  
My husband has memory issues and SEVERE mental health issues stemming from the military. He cannot and straight up will not at this point go through the process of spiritual annulment from his first wife. His first wife was previously married before my husband to a Catholic man and she was an atheist. They had a kid together and got divorced. She married my husband. Obviously no spiritual annulment there from the first husband. He (my husband) never intended to stay with her and only married her out of guilt due to getting her pregnant and fear but always knew he'd leave. She cheated on him with who is now her current husband. We're not even sure where they live.  We haven't been in contact with her in a decade and in fact have a legal no contact order with his entire family. (We got the order not the other way around)

We've contacted our local Parish and sat down with a deacon who explained the annulment process. At first they told me I could join alone and would have to swear to not have sexual relations with my husband. Given his mental state I am actually willing that and am able to make that vow. My husband doesn't feel the same need and drive to join the church as I do. Mostly due to his mental state. They then decided that wasn't an option for some reason and told me the ONLY way I personally could join would be if he did the annulment. My husband is currently in the hospital for the 34th time due to his mental state and wanting to unalive himself (prayers would be greatly appreciated as medications have all failed). 

During our meeting they brought up several theories that, for example, my husband's marriage to her wasn't valid due to the whole lack of annulment from first husband. They also talked about how my husband is baptized (Lutheran) but she wasn't. They brought up the whole cheating aspect and what they finally determined was my husband's ""best scenario"" was stating he married her under false pretenses due to his never intending to stay due to the child growing up ""enough"" one day.   All of this is a moot point as he is unwilling and incapable of writing the paperwork out. I'm his legal guardian too if that shows you how unwell he is. 

I feel stuck and left out of what I consider to be my own faith. When I lived in another state they allowed me to receive the Eucharist even though I hadn't ""officially joined yet"". Good bad or otherwise I don't want to argue that, it is what it is. I miss being that close with Jesus. Yes he is with me daily, but it still feels like I'm missing something.  

I will not divorce my husband. Even with his mental state the way it is I love him with my whole being and I won't abandon him. 

Is there any way for me to join the Catholic church officially if he is unable/unwilling to help me with his annulment. Ps I hope this was understandable. I confused myself even while writing it.

Kind of looking for advice and guidance here&

Im almost at my due date and feeling mentally more and more unstable. Not because of the delivery or postpartum, but because of (irrational) fears and anxiety. 
Im feeling over protective already and am creating scenarios in my head that are driving me crazy. As a result Im feeling sad, angry and terrified all the time. For example Im scared that after the delivery the baby will be taken away from me and I wont have that golden hour skin to skin (for whatever reason) or that family or grand parents will come by uninvited and claim the baby as their own. 
Ive been judged when I said that I would like to spend the first day(s) with my husband and the baby alone to bond saying that Im robbing the grand parents from their time with their first grand baby. It already feels that I owe people MY child that I carried. Im scared that when the baby leaves my body that I have to share him (even with my husband) and that I wont even matter anymore, cause I was just the body that was needed to make this human. 
Im angry at my husband all the time and although he says he wont tell anyone once we have the baby or send pics of the baby without my consent, I struggling to believe him because I will be tired and weak and wont be able to control everything. This is so not me..
Im a midwife and nurse myself so I should know that my anxiety is exaggerated. Im scared that this overbearing will drive me in a postpartum psychosis. Any of you who experienced these feelings?",pregnant,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jc79bz/38w_and_lots_of_anxiety/

Im not too sure what to do here. Im at 20 weeks, so far everything has been great during this pregnancy, but it seems the last two weeks my health is going haywire. The baby is perfectly fine, which Im super happy about. 

Recently got diagnosed with GD at 18 weeks. My blood pressure recently has been elevated, 152/90 as of 3/14. Ive never had high blood pressure before. Last appointment (last week) was 140/60. And my heart rate wont rest below 113. My thyroid levels are also way off (had It removed a couple years ago due to cancer), which they think might be throwing off my heart rate. 

Ive been doing so good with the GD and diet and all that, but now the BP is another obstacle I need to figure out. I did the urine test early on and passed it so preeclampsia wasnt a worry. Theyre having me do it again to see if preeclampsia is now a factor. I dont have any hand or foot swelling and no headaches. 

Has anyone had to deal with GD and HBP during pregnancy? Was there anything you were able to do to help with the HBP? Im going to attempt to cut out a looooot of salt from my diet to see if that helps at all. Ive also only been drinking water since week 16 when I failed the one hour glucose test in case it became a concern later on.

I'm currently 10w3d and experienced severe nausea and vomiting since about 5 weeks (6 weeks on the dot with the vomiting). I was given Reglan that improved it for a couple days before doing nothing at all besides give me shakiness in my muscles, so I stopped. I got to the point of throwing up about 3-5 times a day and always after a solid meal, went to the ER at 8 weeks because severe dehydration was causing my back and ab muscles to cramp so bad I legitimately thought I had an ectopic (I was also spotting a bit prior), they confirmed baby was progressing as expected with a strong heartbeat and textbook structure/size. They gave me a few days worth of Zofran but my doctor refused to refill because he hadn't seen me yet. Regardless, Zofran was effective for only most of those days but did not stop the puking altogether and the last day I had it, it felt like it did nothing. The nausea was getting worse so out of pure desperation I took the Reglan again and dealt with the unwanted symptoms.

I want to say my nausea peaked (so far) last Wednesday night, I threw up/dry heaved 9 times that day, had an absolute delirious mental episode and considered going to the ER before I eventually just passed out on my bed. Thursday hitting the 10 week mark, I felt *slightly* better but still puking. Friday, puked 3 times. Yesterday once, all acid though, but more bone tired than usual like it was a trade off- first time having solid food since Wednesday.  I never stopped actually being nauseous all day even throughout this. 

This morning my nausea resembled more hunger pains than an actual urge to puke. I feel far more lucid. I don't want to jinx myself, I've been fooled before, but I am at the moment feeling 80% more ""normal."" I've been warned about sudden ends to symptoms as something potentially bad, especially since I read that most people reach their peak nausea symptoms around 10 weeks *if* it's a first trimester thing only, and lasting until 12-14 weeks. 

I guess I'm just looking for a peace of mind. I'm not even sure if I should really call my current symptoms progression as a gradual improvement since the nausea never wavered until literally just this morning. I'm holding on the hope that my boobs are still sore and I'm still sluggish that maybe this is actually a good sign and not something to be concerned about.

I get my first scan Thursday so I really won't know anything until then.

2025-03-16,1742122461.0,Spotting due to medication or a pregnancy,"Spotting due to medication or potential pregnancy

Hi all,

I am 40 and my wife is 36.

We have an 8 year old and my wife got an IUD fitted 7.5 years back.

Also, we had been having unprotected sex since then.

She has a regular 28 day cycle (had never missed any except for during her first pregnancy earlier) and had a last due date on March 6th.

We consulted a gynaec and did a pregnancy check with an hcg test on the 9th (3 days from her due date that came out negative).

But there was a confusion as she had experienced some sensitivity and increase in her size of her breasts (from the 3rd day onwards).

She was prescribed deviry 10 mg to resume her menses for 5 days.

It was the 5th and last day of the medication yesterday and she has observed a bit of spotting day before yesterday and today.

If the spotting is considered a side effect of deviry (and that her regular periods can be expected anytime within the next 7-10 days), is there a possibility that she is still pregnant if the periods do not resume in this scenario.

Please share your opinions.

2025-03-15,1742073942.0,First trimester scaries,"Hi there! 
I'm 9 weeks today. Supposedly. 
I'm freaking out constantly that maybe it's already gone. 
This is my third pregnancy, the first made it to 8 weeks but didn't develop past 7. Ended in a d&amp;c. The second made it to 7 and had a miscarriage on my own but I knew it was coming because my blood work wasn't great. 
This one I found out about on Valentine's. I'm not going to lie the timing couldn't be worse, 2 weeks after my due date is my brother's wedding that my husband is the best man in, I'm in the bridal party, and it's all happening at my parents house 4 hours away. But I still want this so bad. 
My husband is very encouraging and says we will keep trying as long as it takes but I'm 37. 
I have two different doctors, my normal gyno doesn't do babies anymore so she recommended my OB. I haven't seen the OB this pregnancy yet, I'm supposed to have an appointment this Wednesday and an ultrasound Thursday. I'm now freaking out because I went to look at the times and they're not showing up in the app anymore so if they got cancelled I'm going to cry. 
My normal gyno ordered blood work Feb 19 that was great and an ultrasound on Feb 26th that was also right on track. 
But I am not having morning sickness at all, maybe I'm just lucky. My breasts are tender and I'm extra gassy and very emotional and tired. But that's all my symptoms. It's making me so nervous. I keep wanting to like just keep taking pregnancy tests or something. How do you get over not knowing if it's ok or not? 
Like eventually they move and stuff so I imagine that will be reassuring. But if it's still there this is the furthest I've ever been but I just don't know if it's still there. 
I'm so sorry this is just a ramble. My Brain is fried, my therapist is out of town for a few weeks, I'm having a time haha.

My husband and I always been on the same page for the names but recently thats come into question. We originally agreed on Thomas Ike and Margaret (Maggie) May. There wasnt an inspiration behind either we just liked the names. 

So what changed? In January my grandfather died and while it was something we were expecting, it really rocked me. It made me think about how present he was in my life and how missed he is. Ive cried nearly every week since his death and it still hits me at random times and places. It really is such a strange thing to be grieving life while growing new life inside you. 

Due to this impact, I recently started thinking about changing our boy name to Thomas Lawrence Lawrence was my grandfathers middle name. I spoke to my husband about this thought and he said ultimately he would be on board if thats the route I want to move in but he feels like the recent grief is heavy on my heart and thats whats inspiring the name change. He is correct. But since the convo I really have no idea anymore. Ive sat on the question independently for about a month and still cant make up my mind. 

Im also worried because since Ive started telling people the names we have, that Ike is an atypical name. It normally makes people stop and question if we said Mike or just flat out misheard me. It makes me worry if we have a boy and I go with the original name that Im setting him up for a life of having to correct people.  

Should we change our boy name to Thomas Lawrence or keep the name as Thomas Ike?

I know they arent Braxton Hicks, because my Braxton Hicks were much different. I go in and they observe me for a bit and they tell me that they think they are just going to discharge me. They believe that this is early labor, but to go home and rest. They let me know its about shift change so a different resident will probably be discharging me. I say ok and wait for a while. This new resident comes in and says that Im getting a cervical exam. I havent gotten one yet, so I have no clue what its like. He explained that he finds it necessary if Im having contractions. He does the exam and says I am 4cm dilated. The nurse goes, no she cant be, she would be a lot more uncomfortable if so. She says that shed like to check. She does and she says Im about 1cm or possibly 2cm. He says he doesnt agree and asks to do another. He does and says that Im 1cm. He says that he must have put his hand on the wrong tissue. He leaves and the nurse asked whos hurt worse, and I told her, the residents did. Mind you I have a higher pain tolerance, and I wanted to cry. She explained that she thinks I would be in more discomfort if I was further along and she believes Im about 30% effaced and 1.5 cm dilated. She says that she believes that he did it wrong. She explained that she didnt have to go far to check and that baby is very far down. She then says shes going to give me the group b strep test. She leaves and comes back in and says they are going to see if Ive progressed at all in 2 hours, but she wont be there. She says that they saw pink discharge after so I should be aware of light spotting but thats all. I wait and get the second cervical check by the same male resident. It hurts almost more. He says that I have no change and that Im 1 cm and that Im going to be discharged and that its just round ligament pain. The other nurse there says that it could be early labor and to not worry and come back if its worse. At this point Im so uncomfortable. I am having horrible spotting and pain. I still 2 days later am having small spotting along with horrible pain and discomfort. Some sharp and some more cramping.

I have genuinely not changed my calorie intake from pre-pregnancy and I think that's what's so frustrating to me. I eat the same portions, and haven't had intense cravings or anything along those lines. But I'm still gaining weight. 

The big problem is up until 3 weeks ago, my blood pressure was normal! No issues whatsoever. I monitor it at home and at the doc appts of course. Now, at 30 weeks pregnant it is high and stressing me out. 140s/80s. 

On top of that I have failed both 1 hr glucose tests I was given by 10mg and even though I already passed my first 3 hr glucose test, I have to go in for a 2nd one tomorrow. I'm terrified of failing it. 

The rational part of me knows that this is related to the pregnancy but I keep hearing stories of women who started getting high blood pressure during pregnancy and it never went away and now they've been on meds for 10+ years. 

But I'm scared of what gestational diabetes AND high blood pressure may result in for me and my baby in these final weeks. 

I'm soooo tired all the time and can barely walk without being winded.  Where as before I was actually pretty active for a plus size girl. I just feel like it's all my fault, and I don't have the energy to fight this. I need to make changes but it all seems like no matter if I do, it's not going to be good enough this late in the game. 

Does anyone have any recommendations or anything that drastically helped? Maybe I also need to hear the bad stories to get my ass into gear and start making some lifestyle changes. It's tough when everyone around you tells you ""it's okay you're eating for two now"" and gives you food all the time.

2025-03-16,1742140120.0,Hi,"Hi

Yesterday I had a positive pregnancy test so thought I would join this subreddit again. I have 2 boys who are 6 and 3 so this will be my third baby.

Im roughly just over 4 weeks pregnant. I thought I was as my period was 4 days late but I had been testing with some cheap test strips from the day I was due on and they all came back negative. I then did a more expensive test &amp; digital test as I felt pregnant and its unusual for my period to be 4 days late and they both came back positive. 

Excited to be joining this community again even though it all seems a bit surreal at the moment and also slightly worried about life with 3 children as my boys are very active and I feel some days are already pretty chaotic!! Me and my husband are pretty go with the flow people so hopefully we wont feel too overstretched!!

Hey yall&.let me start off with this. I know a lot of pregnancies dont have bad things happen during them. 

I (22 F), and my fiancé (23 M), have been talking about children and how many we want and how we want to raise them since forever. Weve been together since I was 18. 

But, Ive started thinking.  What if my pregnancy doesnt go as planned? Theres sooooo many things that could go wrong bc of&well everything. Im terrified of the idea of getting pregnant. Im scared. I want a baby with my spouse so badly though within the next year or two. But Im terrified. What if I fail my baby? What if I miscarry. What if baby grows incorrectly or they are born with a disability (Id still love them dw). What if they grow outside of the womb? What if&&the list goes on and on and on. 


And Ive thought about it all. I miscarried (BD killed it) at 16. Ive talked to my OGBYN and asked if she thought I was infertile because of this. She said she doubts it. Also. My fiancé made a joke the other day. That he would freaking leave me if I was infertile. Now Im even more scared. 


How would he handle it if I gave birth to an unhealthy baby. Or if I have issues with miscarrying babies? My grandmother miscarried a baby boy before my mom was born. Im so scared. I just dont know. Id be devastated if I just couldnt&have children. Also the world we are in today scares me just as much. I was talking with finance about it. Especially about a baby girl. I had a really hard childhood. I had an alcoholic abusive father. I was SA multiple times by multiple men. I was almost trafficked. I have been attacked, I went through substance abuse. I got in a bad crowd. Stuffed with mental health and still do. 

Am I overthinking all of this? Like I feel like I have every reason to fear the future. But also. The joy a child would bring to my life would be immense. Ive always dreamed of having a big family and being a mother. But&..what if it doesnt go as planned? I just dont know. I know that yall may laugh at this. But its a genuine fear.

EDIT: Anywhere I said Advil, Im not taking advil, its off brand Acetaminophen, I got my name brand drugs mixed up,

FTM (22) here, first knowledge of the pregnancy was an at home test, and we are super excited! Id been trying to find an ob/gyn to get scheduled into, but everyone's booked out till April. Cons of being in a town with no other hospitals for 3+ hours.

For a few weeks, id been having terrible right side cramping, enough to bring me to tears in the middle of the night, and overall soreness in my abdomen. After about two weeks, my husband finally forced me to go to the ER to make sure it wasn't ectopic, my appendix, or some other thing. After an ultra sound, the tech looking confused, and two much more in depth ones, they determined I have two endometrial horns? The doc wasn't too entirely sure, but she said that I have a yolk sack w/ no fetal pole in my right horn, and ""small nonspecific fluid or hemorrhage within the left endometrial horn"", along with my right ovary being 2.6x1.9x2.6, and my left one being 4.1x2.1x3.2.

The docs seemed a little concerned, and gave my pregnancy a 50% viability, and wanted me to come back for a repeat quantitative HCG in 48-72 hours, and wanted another ultrasound in 1 week. I was also put on strict pelvic precautions, with no heavy lifting. They referred me to an OB/GYN in branch and sent me on my way.

We came back 3 days later to do the repeat test, and they didn't put in a lab, no one there knew anything about it, they said that was something for my OB to schedule. The only scheduling I can get anywhere close to the ob is with a nurse practitioner New Patient appointment in two weeks. They'll only check my vitals and get me into the system as a patient, a 15 min appointment. I wont even be able to see a doctor. The one they referred me to was on maternity leave, and the only doctor with any slots open was available for mid April, but I cant be scheduled for that at all until my new patient. I cant get in for an ultrasound unless I go back to the ER and check myself in again, or I wait till April to get myself seen by an ob and assessed.

I'm still in a lot of pain, its been about a week calling all over town and even to other towns, and no one can seem to squeeze me in. I cant really sit comfortably, and I don't know if this is normal cramping and I'm being dramatic or what, but work isn't helping me out either. The ER nurse wrote my precautions on my discharge papers, and gave me a note for work, but they ""don't take doctors notes"" and are trying to argue that pushing and pulling carts is ""not lifting because its PUSHING, duh"". I feel like I'm about to pass out on my shifts, but I don't want to go back to the ER just to be told the exact same thing.

Is first trimester usually this rough? I know the vomiting and the tiredness are normal, I can hardly keep anything down and I sleep for 20 hours a day on my days off, but I just cant shake the feeling that somethings fundamentally wrong. I'm taking Advil, but I'm afraid of taking too much, I've always been an anti drugs (for me) kinda person, and its always been ibuprofen that's worked better for me anyways. Independent practices are just as booked up, and I cant de-stress when I'm hurting this much and worried about the baby being okay. Am I doing something wrong, am I missing something?

Unfortunately, she began having intense bleeding a few days ago (at around 6 weeks). We went to the hospital, worrying that it might be ectopic. They did an ultrasound and could barely see the gestational sac. They couldnt visualize a yolk or pole. They told us she was 5 weeks and 3 days pregnant by the imaging and that her HCG levels were relatively low for 6 weeks (around 830). They told us that the bleeding indicated that shes likely miscarrying. She had intense bleeding and was releasing clots for the last few days, but its just spotting now. Her pregnancy symptoms kind of just went away. All of these signs made us think that she already passed the tissue. 

Today, we went for a follow up with her ob-gyn and the sac wasnt just there, but it got larger. The yolk was a bit more visualized today although no embryo was seen. She couldnt see the pole. We were so confused but the doctor said that shes 99.9% sure that shes going to pass the tissue anyway. They took her bloodwork today as well to get some more insight. 

Now, my concern is two fold: 
1) is it likely that she wont be able to pass the tissue herself? What happens then? If the sac is still present and its growing, what does that mean? Is it a blighted ovum? 

2) is there any scientifically reasonable chance shes still pregnant? We were very upset the last few days and my wife just got over the fact that she likely miscarried, but after the ultrasound today, were both in an even more anxious mood, worrying she hasnt passed the tissue. Its just a reminder every time we think about it. ",pregnant,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jcpyr1/6_week_ultrasound_questions/

 I'm both extremely excited about this baby and incredibly nervous. Me and my fiancé always thought it would be at least two years until this happens, as we've been using condoms combined with FAM for contraception for ages. To add to that, exactly around the time I was ovulating I was sick with the flu and by the time I felt better and up for fooling around it had been 24 hours since I ovulated so we thought we were safe. So it's an unexpected pregnancy, but we're not mad about it.
We're anxious as we're just finishing up university this summer. He's been working part time for a year already and he's going to go full time as soon as we're done with our thesis, but we're worried about money a little bit. We do have a place to live where we don't pay rent so that's sorted.
We're also scared about our families' reactions as we really don't know how they'll take the news when we decide to share.

I am currently 9 weeks pregnant. Have told some people but not all. Having a slightly tough time but all normal sickness and tiredness.

My question is, I'm really struggling recently with socialising. My friendship groups are mainly pub based and I very much enjoy hanging out and drinking usually. However since being pregnant I'm finding these evenings so difficult. Obviously not drinking at the moment and I'm usually the only one in the group. The evening usually starts well but as everyone else gets more drunk, I find myself getting tired and just really frustrated with how loud everyone is being, how they're talking over each other, how the conversation gets so hard to contribute to. So I find that I'm sat there getting more and more annoyed at everyone, tired and just wishing the night was over. I feel like a bad sport if I go home early but equally I also worry I'm bringing the vibe down, even though if I try and contribute, I'm usually yelled over by louder, drunk and more energetic people.

I don't want to stop socialising but I'm also starting to slightly dread these nights out which end so rubbish for me

2025-03-16,1742112899.0,Rejected by best friend for being pregnant,"My best friend just cant handle the fact that I want to have a baby and live a heteronormative life. So today, 5 days out from my scheduled c section, she texted me that our friendship is essentially over and shes processing the grief so I need to leave her space. To be clear, she very much wants to stay in my life, but not my babys (wtf lol, shes absolutely not invited-ever- to meet my baby) and shes trying to recover from this perceived betrayal Ive taken with my life choices. 

Making this post as I feel very alone. 

**Background:**
Im 37, married, financially and emotionally stable, have so much support from extended family, am employed with very good parental leave (I live in Germany so its 14 months paid)& Im laying this out to explain that having a baby is not a dumb or rash decision, and that isnt her basis for criticism. 

**The issues:**
I am giving birth in 5 days to a very wanted baby and my best friend has been nothing but negative and mean about it from the beginning. 

For example, I told her Im pregnant and she wrote back RIP to your life, I brushed it off as a joke. She asked me why I would do that, ruin my life, give it up for a life of screaming and hell etc etc. 

**she hates my nursery** love interior design and spent a lot of time and money getting the nursery together. I commissioned my friend who is an artist to paint a custom mural on the wall tying in my cultural history and my husbands cultural history. Its fckn cute. When I showed my best friend I was so proud and she commented  about how ugly it is and she hates it but followed up with oh well at least i dont have to spend any time here looking at it. I let it go. I also got a super rare antique Murano glass chandelier for the room and I know its beautiful. She told me its tacky. Since then she brought up 3 times without prompting or being asked how much she hates the baby room. 

**worst case scenario births** When I was about 16 weeks pregnant and vomiting all day she took it upon herself to outline every single worst case scenario that can happen in birth, from permanent fecal incontenance, to having your uterus removed. I told her to stop (this was via text) and she pushed back and told me I was brainwashed by propaganda and if I knew the truth I would never even have a baby& Its her job to educate me. (Was super offensive and disturbing). 

**life ruined** At about 25 weeks she explained how much my career will suffer and how men avoid doing work within the home and women end up doing everything, about male weaponised incompetence etc.  also about mothers judging each other in mother groups and how bitchy it is (I get that but she knows my scandanavian husband and whats hes like- we have such an equal partnership). 

**c section** It came to a head yesterday when I texted her to tell her Im having a c section on Friday. I said c section on Friday, omg Im so excited and scared. She wrote back the next day well this is your last free weekend ever& you should go out and party. I guess thats not a bad response but it just was the last straw. I told her im sensitive at the moment and I need support and Im genuinely being hurt by her constant barbs and negativity. If she cant be at least neutral then I need some space.

She wrote back that she thanks me for telling her my needs and she will tell me her needs tomorrow. Then I got this big list about how she doesnt believe in motherhood and having babies from a political standpoint, she is genuinely disgusted by babies, she is **grieving the loss of my friendship** (totally news to me since I didnt know we werent friends anymore!). 

Anyways Im just down about it all. Making this post to see if anyone has any words about similar experiences or how to handle the situation. Shes been a big part of my life and strong support and great friend so Im honestly hurt.

And its also sad that shes given me so much negativity about babies and birth that it has overshadowed my excitement for the birth. I mean, I just wrote her one message and end up in this huge discussion about how hard this is for her, and feeling like I need to apologise to her for having a baby .
Is she trying to be mean ? I dont get it 

Edit: shes self diagnosed autistic on the spectrum which is why I have given her so much Lee-way. Im asking myself at what point is it ok to stop being understanding and letting it go ",pregnant,131.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jcgsyf/rejected_by_best_friend_for_being_pregnant/

2025-03-16,1742136501.0,How do I tell my boyfriend I want our daughter to have my last name?,"A little bit of context - I (26F) am 8 months pregnant with my (32M) boyfriends daughter. 

We unexpectedly got pregnant and found out in August of last year. Once we found out, my entire world changed. I obviously stopped drinking, vaping, caffeine, everything to ensure I had a healthy, safe pregnancy (which thankfully I have). My boyfriend struggled with the change. For months, I found him sneaking alcohol behind my back, hiding drinking from me, and being completely irresponsible. We had the talk many times before that if this happened abortion was not an option (for me, I am 100% pro choice though). Here is why: 

I have worked very hard to become financially stable and independent. I purchased my first home at 24 which we live in together (everything is in my name). I have a full time job that I have been at for 3 years with great benefits (including the health insurance that has gotten us 100% through this pregnancy). I work from home and have the ability to keep my daughter home with me once she is born, and 3 months of paid maternity leave. I put money in savings every month and only have a car payment/mortgage. So in my mind, and what we agreed to before, was if I got pregnant we would keep the baby. 

Over the last 8 months, our relationship has really struggled. He has not been supportive or helped me in any way. I have purchased everything for the baby (almost $4,000 worth), paid for our maternity photos, scheduled all the doctors appointments, cooked my own meals, did the nursery alone. All while he was drinking (which he finally says he stopped, I dont have the energy to care anymore), and smoking weed every single day (he still does this). 

I have cried to him many times about the emotional state of our relationship and how I need him at this time but nothing has changed. There is no intimacy in our relationship, and he only cares about himself and the image of having a girlfriend/baby on the way. He owns his own business and does not have health insurance so he contributes nothing (and has NO plan to) for our daughters health. It will all fall on me. 

Im writing to ask, how do I tell him I want her to have my last name? I am terrified our relationship wont last this way, Ive asked about counseling but of course I would have to pay for it. He gets offended when I ask. But I am doing everything for our child. He just feels we are lucky that we wont have to pay for childcare and that Ill breastfeed to save money on formula. But those are still sacrifices I am making, because I will be a full time employee (and bread winner) who is also taking care of our child. 

If our relationship does turn around and we decide to get married one day, it would be much easier to change her last name than to ever get his permission to change it

2025-03-16,1742124188.0,"My sister wants to plan the baby shower, but is totally dropping the ball. She is now hurt that my mother in law has been planning the whole thing. And she is taking it out on *me*.","My sister and I don't have the best relationship to begin with, which makes this a lot harder. She has narcissistic tendencies and there was a period of time where we didn't speak for almost 6 months. But she is always very insistent on us being family and that she wants to do things for me, and has been absolutely *adamant* about planning my baby shower for me. It just always needs to be on her terms, or she likes having something to threaten me with or dangle over my head (i.e. baby shower). Like, if I upset her in any way, she says ""well I just won't throw your baby shower then."" It's a control thing. This leads to her procrastinating, not getting things done in time, dropping the ball, or just not doing things at all. It's a lifelong pattern.

That being said, I was given advice about this situation in the AITAH subreddit to have someone else help her along or watch her. Hold her accountable essentially. My mother in law is an absolute angel. She and I are very alike, meaning she has been on top of everything. She volunteered to do the whole thing and was very happy to join with my sister when I suggested it. My sister seemed happy with it too. Until my sister just didn't do anything for it.

Fast forward a little bit, at 20 weeks pregnant my MIL said she didn't hear from my sister so she booked the venue and did all the phone calls to actually find a place. My sister did not help.

At 21 weeks pregnant, MIL and I are finding addresses and making spreadsheets to make RSVPs easier. My sister didn't add a single address.

At 21+3 weeks pregnant, my MIL sent my sister and I a message updating about addresses, and she specifically mentioned my sister's name and asked her if she wanted to do the invitations. I didn't hear back from my sister in days and, unsure of she reached out to MIL directly, I texted her myself asking if she said anything. She said she didn't because she's been so busy. Her never-ending excuse for everything she doesn't feel like doing. I said fine whatever. I texted MIL to let her know (kindly) about my sister procrastinating and to let me know if she doesn't hear back.

At 22 weeks pregnant, we see MIL in person, and she is excitedly showing DH and I shower invites she created! They're beautiful and so cute, and she took so much stress off of me in that moment. But fearing my narcissistic sister, I asked if MIL ever heard back from my sister. She said she did not. Of course!! Ugh.

Fast forward to last night 22+2, I talked to my sister to let her know that MIL was planning on moving full speed ahead of she didn't hear back. My sister attempted to give me every excuse in the book, and started saying ""well why didn't she follow up with me then??"" She completely ignored the fact that she did in fact receive MIL's message, AND mine following up. I told her she needs to communicate and that's why MIL is moving forward, because it needs to be done. The shower is still 3 months away but MIL wants to order invites and have family from out of state come, so about 2 months beforehand they will go out. My sister said she was planning on ordering the invitations at the end of April when she finally would have time. I said that is over a month from now! She became very aggressive toward me and said ""Your mother in law just wanted to help and now she's doing the whole thing!""

What she doesn't know is that I've learned to hold my ground.

I told her yes, my MIL is doing the whole thing right now, because you cannot communicate with anyone, you procrastinate, and this has to be done. You can do games or themes or decorations when you ""have time"" later, but I am not doing this with you. There is a baby on the way and he will come on the due date, not when you ""have time."" The shower will be done on the date it is scheduled. Not when you ""have time.""

My husband is aware and is very supportive. I reached out to my MIL to let her know that I spoke with my sister about everything (again leaving out details of arguments and feelings). I told her if she doesn't hear back from my sister before the end of the weekend to move forward with the invitation order.

I'm done sparing feelings for my sister because she doesn't seem to prioritize mine in any way. She hasn't lifted a finger for this shower and lets things go too far before she even starts. Not to mention she is completely broke and can't afford anything. My MIL is an absolute hero and I love her. It just sucks that my sister can't get her shit together long enough to even plan a party. A very important one to shower her first nephew to be.

Thanks for listening. This has been an utter nightmare but I feel a lot better not sparing feelings for someone who doesn't give a crap about mine. I am happy to grow a backbone and stand up for myself and my husband and my baby, and I am thankful to have my amazing MIL on my side.",pregnant,12.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jcjcep/my_sister_wants_to_plan_the_baby_shower_but_is/

2025-03-16,1742093328.0,Hospitalization,"Yesterday and today have been a long day, but yesterday I had made plans to unalive myself. I have been suffering with depression + suicidal ideation for years now, I was on medication that helped me for 9 months before I found out I was pregnant. My prenatal care provider had advised me there isnt enough research on the medication I was on during pregnancy, so she had told me the risks and I had opted out of taking it. Mostly because I had took it once and started bleeding for a few days and we were never able to find out what was the cause of the bleeding but it scared me enough out of taking it.

Dont get me wrong I love my baby, and I choose to keep my baby for that reason. I am about to be 20 weeks tomorrow, Ive been struggling with family issues, losing a friend and problems with my childs father since the beginning of my pregnancy. I slowly felt myself getting pushed to the edge (although I did reach out to my doctor for help and we were trying to make a plan to help me mentally during the pregnancy and put me back in therapy) yesterday somethings happened within my family and I did start to plan to unalive myself. 

I noticed me falling into my suicidal ideation and I took myself to get help at the ER, since my doctor has told me go get help when I need it. I told a few of my friends what happened and Im getting a few your being selfish , you have a baby who is depending on you now but I been asking for help for months from these people.

Im glad I noticed the red flags and went to go get help so I didnt hurt me or baby but right now I just feel like shit, the pressure just got to me.

Update: I am currently in the psych ward department in the ER, I have been since Friday night. I started on Zoloft yesterday 50 mg, and Im feeling okay just nausea.

It was already sad to lose the baby, but to think about that whole experience and see I was just negative the whole time. It's heartbreaking to see myself that way.

This time, I'm about 5 weeks, and I wake up and choose to be excited and LOVE this baby for however long I get to have it. I get to be a MOM! And yes, I know I'm early. I know that stats show I have a 20% of losing this. But I'm hanging on to that 80% that I won't. I am choosing to embrace this season, love deeply, feel connectedness to my womb. And I will tell the people I know who will celebrate this with me, and ignore any judgment. I bought gender neutral onsies a couple of days ago because I wanted to and I'm GLAD I did!

When she asked the name and I told her, she had a visceral reaction to it and was not shy about saying she didn't like it. Lol. 

When she asked to see the ultrasound, she got creeped out by it and said it looks disgusting. Lmao.

The list goes on but I digress. 

The way I've been dealing is to act shocked and say wowww, you're the ONLY person who's said that to me. Then I start telling them about how everyone else in my life is so supportive, loves the name, gushes over the ultrasound. She didn't know how to react =

I think the trick is even though it stings, act as positive as possible and show them that it doesn't affect you. Make THEM out like THEY are the weird ones for being all negative Nancy. Honestly it works a charm. 

Someone says baby doesn't look like you even though baby is a spitting image of you? ""Wowww! That's so interesting you say that, you know, you're the only one who has said that. Everyone else says she looks just like me!"" :)

I'm almost 31 weeks pregnant so the bump is bumping and I found it pretty easy to be confident when I had a hoodie or winter coat on, but now the temperatures are rising to t-shirt levels and I feel so insecure about going outside... Like I'm too exposed...

I know I have a normal pregnant body and I'm happy about my baby but I can't stop stressing about what people will say or think of me. I waited so long for spring to come thinking it would be the end of my struggles but now I'm insecure. 

I know at least 1 person here felt that way at some point so what did you do to feel more confident? Do people often comment on your bump? Do you get stares and such? Are people nicer to you when you're pregnant? Should I just stop caring and enjoy the rest of my pregnancy?

I cant zip my pre pregnancy pants, favorite shirts are now tight around my belly. I genuinely feel like Im going through puberty again. I feel so awkward and uncomfy in my own skin. Getting dressed is so difficult. Im simultaneously excited to see my baby grow but feel embarrassed to be visibly pregnant. 

My parents came into town to visit today. I dont have the best relationship with my mom, its been strained since childhood. (Shes narcissistic and a little emotionally immature). Ive been in therapy for years to heal from abuse and work on maintaining healthy boundaries with my family.

Visit was going good until she reached out to touch my stomach at lunch. I reflexively jumped in my seat and loudly said NO. She looked genuinely confused, THEN asked if she could feel baby. I again said no. I felt like I was going to crawl out of my skin and felt a primal sense of protection? I felt rage.

She then said well I can when you get bigger and baby is kicking. I again said no, I do not want to be touched I dont like being touched. She again repeated that she could. 

I really dont want people touching me other than my husband. This is the first time its happened and now Im so anxious that its just the first time. 

Im an autonomous person with a body that is mine&how do I kindly lay these boundaries when all I feel like doing is screaming? I dont want to overreact but no is no. This is my body and my baby. 

I know a lot of this is my hormones. (A degree is past childhood trauma, Ill check in with my therapist about this in a couple days). A lot of this is learning to be comfortable with my changing body& but did anyone else feel this way? Just awkward and unsure of their body? Not wanting anyone else to touch them?

They have been closely monitoring me since week 20 and i was told early intervention will be needed if necessary, it took me awhile to process this but i was mentally prepared. Our goal was to reach 37 /36 week but not to go beyond that because anything more than that will cause distress to the baby. So yesterday my OB wanted me to get admitted because she didnt want to take any chances also because of my Bp 130/100 and will closely monitor me for IUGR for coming weeks. My Bp looks normal this morning which is funny  and baby is actively moving so I feel stupid now for rushing to the hospital. I was also given steroid shot. I know being around the nurses is the safest for my baby but I really want to make it at least to 36 weeks. My OB told me the baby will come anytime if there is severe growth restriction i know she wants the best for me and the baby but I want to cook it for longer, in 2 days time I will be 34 weeks. So i just need 2 weeks more at least but i am shit scared for nicu if the baby comes early. I wonder if they will ever discharge me or wont let me out until I delivery this baby. 
Sometimes I feel like i am wasting everyones time here since everything looks good as for now. Bp stabilized, heart beat normal and she is moving and I blame my anxiety for agreeing to be admitted, maybe I couldve just waiting for one more week. 
And now I  ranting here thinking whether i did a right thing panicking for no reason. I know its too late now as I am already admitted but just wanted some reassurance here whether i did the right thing. 
Also I would love to hear positive stories of 34 weeker Nicu baby. Because my chances she might be evacuated around 34. 
I dont know what i am looking for now. Reassurance, positive stories, motivation anything that would ease my mind now.

2025-03-16,1742132442.0,At odds with DH weeks before due date&,"I hate that Im even making this post but I need to vent about my relationship. It might be long so thanks if you actually read it. 

I would describe my husband as a pretty stoic, rational man. He doesnt really give in to negative emotions, generally is able to stay on the positive side of things. He is pretty indifferent to small daily stressors, not overwhelmed easily. Pretty even keel. 

Well he dropped a bomb on me the other day that he is really struggling with not feeling important or a priority during the pregnancy. That his feelings are responsible for him not showing me affection and being distant lately. His justification for these feelings are based off a casual conversation we had a month ago where he said he felt like he was on the back burner to which I agreed. I said it sucks but yeah you kind of are, Im the one thats pregnant. The focus needs to be on me and the baby. 

Apparently he had been feeling badly for some time before he brought it up a month ago and said that the conversation just confirmed what he was feeling so he just decided to harbor negative feelings and allow them to change the way he interacted with me. But he let me leave that conversation feeling like things were resolved and led me to believe we were in a good place. 

I feel pretty blindsided. Hes done this before, concealed feelings and let them negatively impact our relationship and then it all kinda blows up. Im due in less than 3 weeks, why did he have to do this now??? 

Anyway idk Im questioning everything. Im feeling like my sacrifices have been all for naught and Ive not been appreciated or acknowledged for anything Ive done. Youd think I was abusive or something toward him or putting all the responsibility on him. I havent been. Ive still been working, taking care of the household, shopping, etc. even though its been such a struggle. I try not to even ask him for things because I feel like a burden. 

Im in so much pain lately and trying to mentally and physically prep for birth and Im getting hit with this crap right now. I mean what was I supposed to do, coddle him this entire time? I just dont really understand it. Im just so tired and dont know where to go from here. I dont even feel like talking to him about it or fighting about it. 

Ironically enough, I had just written him a heartfelt letter and put together a box of all his favorite snacks to give him before the baby is here.. I hadnt even had the chance to give it to him yet before he finally decided to be honest about his feelings. Ugh.

I thought for sure I had GD based on some people saying at 190 they were diagnosed right away without a 3 hour. I got a call from my OB and they asked me to go get the 3hr GTT asap. I did it yesterday and passed all of them!

Fasting (range 65-94) - 81

1 hour (&gt;180) - 171

2 hour (&gt;155) - 141

3 hour (&gt;140) - 94

I just wanted to share as I had trouble finding stories with anyone that was as high as my 1 hour that didnt have GD. 

I have since learned that stress can affect your blood sugar and I was driving all day before my 1 hour for my kids band assessment, dropped my phone in a public toilet, and had a particularly hard time finding a quest location that had appts/walk in time available after their assessment which was the only time Id have to take the test.

And for what its worth (though I know you cant trick your body and should eat how you normally eat before the 1- hour test) prior to my test I had my normal morning coffee, and took my kids for a treat breakfast at McDonalds. My order was a bacon egg and cheese bagel, hash brown we ate about 6 hours before my test. I also had about 1.5 liters of water between breakfast and my test.

Lastly, my experiences during both tests were fine. I had the lemon lime at the 1 hour (tasted like flat sprite) and fruit punch at the 3 hour (tasted like red Kool-Aid, this is the best of the 3 imo, for Fisher Healthcare brands anyway). 

The 3 hour was boring but I had a book, my phone, and some headphones. I was not allowed to leave the lobby during the test. After I was done my husband and kids drove me home which was 1.5 hours away. I was extremely fatigued. At about the 1 hour mark (so 4 hours after drinking the glucose drink) I started feeling really faint, I got really hot, even though I had the air on as low as it would go. My clothes were drenched in sweat and I had trouble breathing. I felt really nauseated and just altogether *not well*. I must have looked pale/sick too bc my husband kept asking if I was okay.

So normally im not one to complain but this is my first baby and ive waited and rescheduled this anatomy scan so many times so my experience really upset me. Also no im not homophobic maybe im wrong but a lot of the stuff im about to right that was said just kind of annoyed me.


So to start it off the appointment was 20 minutes late and my mum had driven hours to come and see the baby and this ultrasound is supposed to be the last one to see the baby before birth and we paid $270. My partner and i were super excited as i had been in hospital a few days prior for reduced movement so just wanted to see our girl. We got into the appointment and the man doing our scan was super entitled, rude to my mum, myself and partner. he breaks part of the equipment before we even start and i just brush it off, he then put the tv screen on where we can see the baby and it doesnt turn on properly, we asked if maybe someone could check it out and he said that this scan wasnt for our entertainment and theres a reason he didnt go into IT, at this point i kind of just wanted to cry. He kept on pressing way to hard and would pull my pants down without even asking me (yes i know sometime they need to go low but its nice to have a little warning instead of someone ripping your pants down). He then asked if we new the gender and i said yes its a girl we are super excited and was talking about her little outfits and he said i prefer not to gender them and colour isnt really a gender thing anyways. At this point i kind of gathered his opinions and views and it really annoyed me how he treated us. i understand everyone is allowed their views but it felt wrong that he kept on shutting down my own opinions and excitement on my own daughter. Finally he tried to take a few of her measurements and couldnt get them, he took the measurements which put her way behind her date instead of rescheduling and kept calling her annoying because she wouldnt move or would suck on her hand or something shed do. i barely got to see her cause the screen was broken.

I cannot sleep for longer than like 3-4 hours at a time before waking up with such bad stomach pain I cant sleep any longer. I called to make a doctors appointment (I had a miscarriage last September) and they told me I was going to have to wait untill Im almost 10 weeks pregnant, which is unfair as last time they seen me at 5 weeks and after miscarriages theyre supposed to see you earlier to make sure everythings okay. I live in a small town in northern canada and have literally no other options (except for a 2 hr drive which I wont be able to make at this rate).

2025-03-16,1742101915.0,I think Im having a miscarriage. Help please,"Hello,

Im going to give a detailed account of my experience. I may share unnecessary information, but thats because I dont know much about pregnancy or miscarriages.

Im 35. This is my first pregnancy. I removed my IUD 6 months ago but only last month my partner and I checked when was my fertile period and then had sex multiple times around that time.

We were very surprised I got pregnant. It felt easy, since it was the first time we really tried.  It felt very unexpected.

I discovered the pregnancy 5 days ago, and that should have been when it was a little less than 4 weeks long.

The miscarriage:
Day 1: 2 days ago I had some very brown discharge, what look exactly like what I get a day before my period. Later that day I got a little more and what looked like some very dark blood. The quantities seem small, not enough to fill a pad, but also seem a bit more than what I read that was normal to happen. I was supposed to be in the implantation phase.

Together with that I felt constant but very mild cramps. No other pains. I tested again to make sure I was pregnant. I had 3 positive tests already.

Day 2: I had very mild cramps also most of the day, and some very brown discharge in the morning. Maybe enough to cover half of a panty protector type of pad, those small ones.

Day 3: I woke up early this morning feeling still really mild cramps. When I went to pee I noticed very little drops of very dark or brown blood, like spotting, on the toilet paper. A couple drops in the toilet water. 

This is the entire situation. This doesnt look good at all, but I also didnt had any red, or mid period like blood coming out. The tiny cramps feel like something is cooking in my uterus, in a bad way. 

I honestly still dont feel like I had a miscarriage, but all the facts point towards the high chance that its already on the way. Mostly because I seem to have had 4x a higher volume of spotting than the usual, and these damn constant, often hard to notice cramps. Sometimes I feel like Im imagining them because I focus so much at that part of my back.

I am okay (as much as one can be) with the possibility of having a first miscarriage. I know how common these are, they happened so much around me already. And Im honestly already so relieved that my partner and I can conceive. My struggle now is not knowing for sure that the pregnancy is gone. Between the first spotting and then several hours without any spotting yesterday, I went from being almost sure it was going to be a loss to hopeful that maybe that was just the implantation symptoms. Maybe I was spotting more than usual because I do get very heavy period the first 2 days of a period.

Anyway, I of course tried to reach out to a doctor on Friday, when this first started, but couldnt get a hold of one. If anyone here lives in the Netherlands, youll know the struggle.

And I know nobody - other than doctors - can really tell me what is happening for sure, but I would still like to kindly ask for anyone who has similar experiences to share any information that you believe may help me.

And to anyone going through a miscarriage, I hope you have the support of people you love. For what I can tell so far, thats the most important. 

Thank you,

2025-03-16,1742127540.0,Worried about my partners mental health (CW loss),"
Im currently 11 weeks pregnant, this is our third pregnancy after a MMC at 13 weeks and a chemical last year. We are now reaching the timeframe we lost our first baby (it passed away at 11.5 weeks). Last week we were told the baby has an enlarged NT which can mean an increased chance of chromosomal abnormalities, were currently (very) anxiously waiting for our NIPT results.

My partner is South African, anyone who knows Afrikaans men will tell you theyre often very traditional and keep to the more classic macho traits. My partner doesnt talk about his feelings - unless hes had a good amount to drink. 

I know my partner struggles with the fact that I obviously feel everything and am so heavily impacted by this pregnancy, he feels kind of on the sideline just waiting to be told how things are going. When I try and talk to him about the pregnancy his response is pretty much always Im sure itll be fine this time. 

On top of that, he doesnt seem that happy with his own stuff. Hes been very demotivated at work for a while. Hes normally very active and also a bit of a thrill seeker, and enjoys a lot of riskier sports. Since our first pregnancy, he quit the riskier stuff, but also hasnt really been enjoying the gym either. He also reads a lot of very negative content online lately and expresses his anger at the state of the world. We currently live in quite a rough area of town, we are moving to the countryside this summer but I know living in this area is also not helping. 

Anyway, over the past few weeks Ive noticed his drinking increase quite a lot. We spoke about it last night and he said he was aware of it, but that he was just so f*cking bored with life at the moment. Obviously with house and baby I was sad to hear this because, although right now life is a little monotonous, we have so much to look forward to. He insisted his feelings were nothing to do with me or our relationship, just the monotony of daily life right now. 

I dont know what to do. He said its not my problem to fix, that he needs to sort himself out. But I cant help but feel really sad about this, on top of the continued pregnancy anxiety, Im really worried about his headspace. Maybe this is how his anxiety comes out, since he doesnt show much emotion in any other capacity. Hes just not the type of person to go speak to someone, so Im not sure how else he can get help.

Baby girl is supposed to be delivered at 37 weeks and Im so paranoid that we wont make it that far. I have a history of preeclampsia and ended up delivering my first baby at 35 weeks. After 50 hours of labor resulting in a c section, and being stuck on bedrest on the mag drip, its safe to say I have slight ptsd from that experience. 

Anyone have any tips for staying calm/relaxed to help keep my BP down? Also does anyone have experience with procardia vs Labetalol? I feel like I need to switch to Labetalol or add a dose in on top of my procardia.

My baby is 10 months old and I just found out I'm pregnant again (this was wanted and we're so excited). 

My boy is a massive 99th percentile and has always loved food whether it's boob or solids. Even before I got pregnant, the daily feeds were starting to get hard. He's got 8 teeth and he would suck a little then just bite me - never seemed interested in actually having a decent feed. I would always offer before then giving him solids. The first feed when he wakes up for the day has remained really good. 

I've been pumping heaps to try and maintain supply in case he wants to come back to it more during the day but if I'm honest, it's starting to feel pointless. 

Now I'm pregnant again. I'm tired. I have stuff I want to accomplish before baby number 2 and wasting the time to pump when I'm barely getting anything anymore just feels... pointless? 

He likes formula and I know there's nothing wrong with it but I always had it in my mind he wouldn't need formula and I would feed him until at least a year but idk how achievable that goal is now. 

Being pregnant again I'm just so freaking tired and part of me feels like I should give my body a break. I will keep up with the morning feeds as long as he lets me cos another huge part is not ready for this journey to end with him. :(

Ive been steadfast in my decision from the start so I havent been emotional really throughout this process, Im just feeling relieved as I type this. Here is my experience with the medication for anyone whos worried!

Last night around 7pm I took the step 1 pill (mifepristone) by mouth and had no side effects. 

I woke up this morning with my usual morning sickness and then i had my morning coffee and doom scrolled tiktok for a few hours before getting ready to take step 2. I prepped by setting up my bed with my heating pad and a towel to protect my mattress, love island on the tv, snacks, meds within reach and water. I live alone so was alone for the process but kept my best friend updated throughout the day. Heres how my day today went:

11:30: clonazepam x1, ate toast and jam

12:00: Tylenol 3 x2
Naproxen x1

12:25 800 mg misoprostol vaginally

1:05- severe cramps, nausea, light headed, shaky, lasted 15 min

1:15 clonazepam x1

2:00 ate chicken nuggies &amp; smoothie

2:45 mild cramping &amp; heavy bleeding begins (small clot)

3:20 cramping getting worse 

3:45 2 large clots, lots of blood in toilet when went to go pee

4:20 2 more large clots, cramps getting worse again
 
4:25 Tylenol 3 x2

5:00-7:45 nap time. mild- mod cramping

7:45- Carrie scene while walking to bathroom after nap. One more large clot. Straight into shower. 

8:00- all cleaned up, mild cramping, still heavily bleeding

9:00- eat late supper, feeling mostly normal, very mild cramping, moderate-heavy bleeding

Honestly, the worst part was the really bad cramps around 1pm. Passed like 5 med-large clots altogether and used maybe 7 pads over the course of the day. Dont be afraid if you are!

2025-03-16,1742147691.0,Medication Abortion - Positive Experience,"Hi all, 25F here, US/North Carolina. I was absolutely terrified to go through with my MA this weekend so I wanted to share my experience in case it helps someone else. 

Some background, I was 5-6 weeks pregnant for my abortion and I am prone to extremely bad menstrual cramps for my normal period, which made me really scared to go through with the misoprostol. In North Carolina, you have to go through a consent appointment 72 hours prior to the abortion, so I did that at a local clinic. It was a bizarre experience where I had an ultrasound, light bloodwork, and counseling (if you can even call it that). 

On Friday I took the mifepristone at the clinic in a room of like 6 other women. I had little to no side effects from the mifepristone, other than emotional effects. I took Naproxen instead of Ibuprofen because it works much better for me, so I started that on Friday. Yesterday I took two rounds of misoprostol (8 pills total). Dissolving them in my mouth was definitely unpleasant but not a huge deal, made my gums kind of sore after. I started cramping within 20-30 minutes and started bleeding about an hour after starting the pills. I took Naproxen an hour before starting the first round and Zofran right before. I prepped with period underwear (dont skip out on this part!) and overnight pads. I had 2 heating pads, one that wraps around my back and one for the front. 

Like I mentioned, my menstrual cramps are horrific normally (Ive taken toradol injections at urgent care for the pain before) and my periods are very heavy (8 days long) so I was worried my abortion pain would be proportional to that, but luckily with the Naproxen and heating pads, it was comparable to a bad period for me. You should definitely prepare to be as sedentary as possible (I found that moving around made the cramps and nausea worse). If you can have someone with you to support you and get anything you need, its a huge help. 

I passed the pregnancy about 4 hours after the first round which is about when I started the second round of misoprostol. I made sure to eat something and drink electrolyte drinks before the second round because the nausea and stomach cramps were pretty bad. I had some diarrhea as well. By the second round of misoprostol, I had already passed the largest clots and it was just a lot of bleeding by that point. I used about 5-6 overnight pads the first night. Make sure you have a heating pad with an automatic timer/shut off so you can go to sleep with it on. I made sure to take another Naproxen before I went to bed at about midnight. Unfortunately, for some reason 12am-3am was kind of the worst of the pain for me, idk if it was the stomach cramps and nausea or what but that was the hardest part, but still not the worst pain Ive ever experienced. By the time I woke up in the morning, the worst of it was over and I didnt need any pain meds anymore. Im still having mild cramping today but overall it had not been NEARLY as bad as I expected. I expected to be crying all night from the pain, but I never got to that point. Here are the items I found most helpful:
- Period underwear
- Thick overnight pads
- Electrolyte drinks (hydration will help your nausea) 
- Wrap around heating pad with automatic shut off timer
- Zofran/anti nausea medication and pain medication that works best for you
- Popsicles and Italian ices (the cold helped my nausea)
- Applesauce and rice (to be able to take the meds) 
- All the distraction items you might need. Video games, books, movies chosen beforehand, etc. 

My DMs are open if anyone has questions about my experience or needs to vent. This was one of the hardest things Ive ever had to go through so Im happy to help you through it.

2025-03-16,1742130618.0,Cramping on left side 3 weeks after medical abortion,"Hey guys, I need some advice. About 3 weeks ago I had a medical abortion at 6 weeks pregnant. I ordered the pills online, it's my second abortion so I didn't go to a doctor, also just for the simple fact that I have state insurance and it's very hard to find a provider around me that covers the cost of an abortion.

But for the last 2 days, I have had cramping that is specifically on my left side. It radiates to my hip and I can feel it in my leg, butt and back as well. It feels just a tad bit more intense than my normal period cramps but nothing crazy. My bleeding has started lightening up over the past day or 2, but this cramping has just been so consistent over the past 2 days that I'm starting to worry. Last night I decided to take a pregnancy test just to make sure that my hcg levels were going down, but it still came back very positive.

I can say that I did see the sac come out when I had my abortion, so I know that my body dispelled SOMETHING. All of my bleeding was normal and everything had passed. I guess I'm just concerned about a potential ectopic pregnancy? I've never experienced one so I'm not sure what that pain would feel like. The cramping just feels very odd, especially for how directed it is in my left side and it's not just a general cramping feeling in my uterus.

Just figured i'd post on here and ask if anyone has experienced anything like this before taking myself over to the ER to get an ultrasound done....",abortion,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jcl3oj/cramping_on_left_side_3_weeks_after_medical/
2025-03-16,1742146227.0,SA with no Sedation - Positive Experience,"This was not my first abortion, but it was my first surgical. I opted to not do medical this time as I have health anxiety (and GAD), so I disliked the self-regulating aspect of the MA. I also liked the idea of it being over in 10 minutes vs the MAs 10+ hours. I chose to do no sedation honestly because the idea of even partial sedation kind of freaks me out. I liked the idea of being somewhat in control, and I felt like I wouldnt have that with sedation. This is just me though and my weird health anxiety brain. 

Before the procedure: The day of the procedure, my bf and I went to the clinic around 1:15 (apt was 1:30). I was taken for a vaginal ultrasound around 1:45 and they said I was 5wks3days.  Then, I was given an antibiotic and my bp was taken. I then had to wait for the Dr to arrive for about 45 more minutes. 

I was moved to the room and told to undress from the waist down and put a pad in my underwear (for after). I was hoping they would give me an ibuprofen or something before the procedure, but they didnt. Then, I laid down and waited for the nurse to come and set up the instruments. She did and then the other nurses and Dr came in. They were all very chatty and friendly. We kept talking about my decision to not have the sedation: they were telling me that if at any point I changed my mind, we could do it, but I didnt feel pressured at all. I feel like I have a decent pain tolerance after having a chronic ankle injury and heavy periods with a lot of cramps. I was less worried about the pain since it wouldnt last for that long, I was more just nervous/anxious about the whole thing. 

The procedure: At first, the Dr. examined me to check the placement of my cervix (I think). Then, he put in the speculum, and it was cold and honestly kinda pinched, but it didnt hurt really. Then, he gave me the lidocaine injections to my cervix, and they didnt really hurt. I remember them all asking and I said, I just kinda feel my cervix, and they laughed and said that was a good sign. Then, he started with the dilation rod and that hurt! It wasnt 10/10 pain but definitely uncomfortable pain that caused me to kind of kick my legs a little (lol). It definitely hurt every time it happened - it happened maybe 5 times during the procedure and almost felt like he was just moving something around in there. It was maybe 8-9/10 pain but only lasted for 5-10 seconds each time. I just closed my eyes and breathed while trying not to tense up, although I definitely made faces (not really noises other than comments like oh ouch or yeah that kind of hurts). The suction didnt really feel like anything, it was a little uncomfortable and maybe a little painful (2/10) but not as bad as my normal period cramps and not nearly as bad as the other feeling I described above. The whole thing last probably 5-7 minutes and the part after the lidocaine shots (which felt like the real beginning) lasted only about 2-3 minutes. I didnt see anything that came out as I was either looking at the ceiling, had my eyes closed, or was talking to one of the nurses next to my head. During the procedure they also were checking my uterus with an ultrasound on my abdomen, but that I kind of just zoned out and forgot that was happening. They pulled all of the stuff out and it was definitely relieving, not painful at all. It really just felt like I could relax everything down there finally. Then, they said good job and left other than one of the nurses. She brought me my underwear and pants and put them on for me (this part was so awkward lol). I think its the normal procedure if someone gets sedation, but I feel like I could have just done it myself& it was just so awkward lol. I ended up just asking to do it myself and she let me.

After: I felt weak and was cramping a lot after. Other stories I read said that once the procedure was done, all the pain went away, but that wasnt the case for me. I had pretty bad cramps for maybe 5 minutes. Then, they lessened to mild cramps. They had me sit in an inside waiting room and took my blood pressure twice. They gave me a pack of crackers and water, which I took, and also offered an ibuprofen that I declined. I sat there for probably 20 minutes total and then they said I could leave. In total, I was there from 1:15-3:00. 

Now, as Im writing this it had been about 22 hours and the cramping has become almost none. I had mild cramps for maybe an hour after, but I took naproxen and havent had any since. I did wake up nauseous today, which I didnt have during the pregnancy, but it went away fairly quickly. 

Overall, I would probably do the same route again, without the sedation and all, but I would take a naproxen before the procedure since all I had was the lidocaine.

I asked him why he had previously told me he loved me and he said, that he didnt know why but that we would be alright. 

I know that he has a visa that limits him on the type of companies that will sponsor him, which is something he complains about everytime we speak. I am scared he is going to use our child to get a family visa.

I also have an underlying condition which could cause me to have a difficult pregnancy and having to go through all that by myself, will be difficult.

i have not bled but only been passing tissue since the MA, and i was able to get them to do an ultrasound when i went to the ER for the concussion. they consulted with my OB/GYN and i have 1.3cm thick tissue on my endometrium retained from the pregnancy. i was given the option of waiting to see if it passes with subsequent periods, but im terrified of retained tissue leading to future pregnancy complications. tried misoprostol again for the tissue and absolutely nothing happened, so they scheduled me for D+E later this week. i am so tired and just want to get to the point where i can cope with the grief and depression and work towards having my life back. 

i made the decision to have the procedure because of this, but im also really do not want to have to go through another traumatic medical experience, especially without support. i have read a lot of others stories about waiting for this tissue to pass for months without any luck. is going through with the D+E worth it? should i wait? please feel free to share experiences in either direction, hope everyone is getting by out there d",abortion,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jcbhj1/rpoc_2_weeks_after_ma_at_105_weeks_de/

2025-03-16,1742107819.0,Pmdd post abortion : TN USA,"  In August, I had an abortion. 

Before this happened, I had never been on birth control before and I did not feel that I suffered from mood swings surrounding my period. Id have one random cry every month and know it must mean my period was coming. =

Flash forward to September, I got a copper IUD. And immediately felt insanely emotional. Crying spells daily and PMDD that was debilitating. My poor partner, I was an absolute menace. Ive never experienced anger and sadness quite like the six months I had the IUD. 

After things hit a breaking point and I didnt feel my body was adjusting, I got the IUD removed and switched to YAZ. Which is the only birth control Ive found that is supposed to help with PMDD. 

I am three weeks into yaz and while I feel better, I do NOT feel as good as I did pre pregnancy. The week before my period still feels like hell. I am irritable, angry, and cannot stop crying. Ive never experienced PMS like this pre pregnancy. 

Is this a normal response post abortion? Will this get better with time? Is there anything I can do to make the week before my period not absolute hell for everyone involved? ",abortion,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jcfozs/pmdd_post_abortion_tn_usa/

2025-03-15,1742070086.0,"Do Women Have a Moral Duty to Keep Their Bodies ""Ready"" for Reproduction at All Times?","Late last year, Dr. Rebecca Gomperts (Aid Access, Women on Waves) announced results of a large clinical trial in Moldova, testing the use of a weekly low dose of mifepristone (50 mg) as a contraceptive. The results were promising, with only one pregnancy occurring within 2000 cycles. Furthermore, negative side effects were minimal, with only 4% of the participants experiencing any negative side effects (compared to a 40% negative side effect rate for conventional hormonal contraceptives). Additionally, the low-dose mifepristone was easier to use, requiring only one dose a week, and being more ""forgiving"" of variations in the time the pill is taken. And 89% of the study participants reported that they stopped menstruating while taking mifepristone as a contraceptive. (Probably most women would consider this a positive side effect.)

Because of the positive results, the trials have been expanded to the Netherlands this year. If the results continue to be positive, the plan is to apply to the European Medicines Agency for registration and market authorization to allow this weekly, low-dose mifepristone regimen as a contraceptive throughout the EU.

The method of action for mifepristone as birth control is two-fold: it reduces the rate of ovulation and it thins the endometrial lining of the uterus, making it impossible for a fertilized egg to implant.

([Source](https://msmagazine.com/2025/01/07/mifepristone-weekly-contraceptive-clinical-trials-abortion-pill-birth-control/).)

My primary question for PL supporters is this: 

* Would you have any moral or legal objections to women's use of such a contraceptive? If so, on what grounds?

Here are some secondary questions if you believe that the use of this contraceptive would be immoral:

* If a woman was taking mifepristone as described here *as a contraceptive* and informed her partner that she was doing this before they had sex, and if her partner, knowing this, decided to go ahead and have PIV sex with her, and if one of his sperm fertilized an egg but it failed to implant, whose would be the primary responsibility for the ""death"" of the fertilized egg? (Realistically, neither of them would ever know if this happened, so this is a hypothetical question.)
* *Men's* use of tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, red meat, and food high in trans fats during the months before their partners' conception is associated with higher miscarriage rates, because of these substances' impacts on sperm. ([Source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/a-mans-unhealthy-lifestyle-too-can-lead-to-his-partners-pregnancy-loss/articleshow/64072130.cms?from=mdr).)  If men engage in such unhealthy lifestyles, they are not maintaining their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction, and their choices could result in the ""death"" of a fertilized egg or even an embryo or fetus. Do they have a moral duty to maintain their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction by refraining from such lifestyle choices?",Abortiondebate,56.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jc47ep/do_women_have_a_moral_duty_to_keep_their_bodies/
2025-03-16,1742136839.0,Abortion is Absolutely Justified,"Premises:

1. Moral worth is based on current capacity for sentience, as **only sentient beings can experience harm**.

2. A pre-sentient fetus **lacks the ability to experience harm** and has no present interests.

3. Forcing a sentient person to remain pregnant **imposes significant physical, psychological, and emotional harm**.

4. Future potential does not create present moral worth; moral status depends on actual characteristics, **not hypothetical ones**.

5. When a **moral conflict** arises, the entity capable of experiencing harm (the pregnant person) has **greater moral weight** than a non-sentient fetus.

Conclusion:

Before fetal sentience, abortion is morally justified because **there is no meaningful harm to the fetus**, while forcing pregnancy **significantly harms a sentient person**.

We unexpectedly got pregnant and found out in August of last year. Once we found out, my entire world changed. I obviously stopped drinking, vaping, caffeine, everything to ensure I had a healthy, safe pregnancy (which thankfully I have). My boyfriend struggled with the change. For months, I found him sneaking alcohol behind my back, hiding drinking from me, and being completely irresponsible.

I have a full time job that I have been at for 3 years with great benefits (including the health insurance that has gotten us 100% through this pregnancy). I work from home and have the ability to keep my daughter home with me once she is born, and 3 months of paid maternity leave. I put money in savings every month and only have a car payment/mortgage. So in my mind, and what we agreed to before, was if I got pregnant we would keep the baby. 

Over the last 8 months, our relationship has really struggled. He has not been supportive or helped me in any way. I have purchased everything for the baby (almost $4,000 worth), paid for our maternity photos, scheduled all the doctors appointments, cooked my own meals, did the nursery alone. All while he was drinking (which he finally says he stopped, I dont have the energy to care anymore), and smoking weed every single day (he still does this). 

I have cried to him many times about the emotional state of our relationship and how I need him at this time but nothing has changed. There is no intimacy in our relationship, and he only cares about himself and the image of having a girlfriend/baby on the way. He owns his own business and does not have health insurance so he contributes nothing (and has NO plan to) for our daughters health. It will all fall on me. 

Im writing to ask, how do I tell him I want her to have my last name? I am terrified our relationship wont last this way, Ive asked about counseling but of course I would have to pay for it. He gets offended when I ask. But I am doing everything for our child. He just feels we are lucky that we wont have to pay for childcare and that Ill breastfeed to save money on formula. But those are still sacrifices I am making, because I will be a full time employee (and bread winner) who is also taking care of our child. 

If our relationship does turn around and we decide to get married one day, it would be much easier to change her last name than to ever get his permission to change it

2025-03-16,1742093328.0,Hospitalization,"Yesterday and today have been a long day, but yesterday I had made plans to unalive myself. I have been suffering with depression + suicidal ideation for years now, I was on medication that helped me for 9 months before I found out I was pregnant. My prenatal care provider had advised me there isnt enough research on the medication I was on during pregnancy, so she had told me the risks and I had opted out of taking it. Mostly because I had took it once and started bleeding for a few days and we were never able to find out what was the cause of the bleeding but it scared me enough out of taking it.

Dont get me wrong I love my baby, and I choose to keep my baby for that reason. I am about to be 20 weeks tomorrow, Ive been struggling with family issues, losing a friend and problems with my childs father since the beginning of my pregnancy. I slowly felt myself getting pushed to the edge (although I did reach out to my doctor for help and we were trying to make a plan to help me mentally during the pregnancy and put me back in therapy) yesterday somethings happened within my family and I did start to plan to unalive myself. 

I noticed me falling into my suicidal ideation and I took myself to get help at the ER, since my doctor has told me go get help when I need it. I told a few of my friends what happened and Im getting a few your being selfish , you have a baby who is depending on you now but I been asking for help for months from these people. Especially my childs father and people didnt take my cries for help serious, until now. 

Im glad I noticed the red flags and went to go get help so I didnt hurt me or baby but right now I just feel like shit, the pressure just got to me.

Update: I am currently in the psych ward department in the ER, I have been since Friday night. I started on Zoloft yesterday 50 mg, and Im feeling okay just nausea. The plan is to put me in a in patient psych ward and I dont know how I feel about that, but I guess its what they believe is best for me and baby.

Now that Im nearing 30 weeks, all these emotions are bubbling up, and I dont know how to tackle it.

For context, my husband is a sailor and is away from home 6-7 months a year, when we found out about the pregnancy, we planned his departure such that he was with me for most of this first trimester and would return around the last month, however his dad passed away in the middle of this and he had to (of course) come back. That kind of changed the entire course of things and now hes only due to be back a month or two post the babys birth. 

I still have a village to support me, my parents, his mom, siblings, extended family, great friends and a trusted healthcare system but I still feel sad that he wont be here to experience and see me give birth.

2025-03-16,1742147581.0,I'm choosing to stat positive and excited every day,"I had a chemical pregnancy back in October, and pretty much knew I was pregnant for about a week. That whole time, I was just anxious and my every thought was ""don't be excited because you could lose it"" sure enough, I did. But man I wish I had just let myself experience the joy of finding out I was pregnant. It was already sad to lose the baby, but to think about that whole experience and see I was just negative the whole time. It's heartbreaking to see myself that way. I have always wanted to be a mother, and I thought I was guarding my heart. But I was denying myself the joy of motherhood, even if it was just for a week. 

This time, I'm about 5 weeks, and I wake up and choose to be excited and LOVE this baby for however long I get to have it. I get to be a MOM! And yes, I know I'm early. I know that stats show I have a 20% of losing this. But I'm hanging on to that 80% that I won't. I am choosing to embrace this season, love deeply, feel connectedness to my womb. And I will tell the people I know who will celebrate this with me, and ignore any judgment. I bought gender neutral onsies a couple of days ago because I wanted to and I'm GLAD I did! This baby is so loved, and I am optimistic I will meet them someday. But if I don't, then I'll know that I allowed myself to experience this pregnancy authentically me. I will mourn my loss, I will be heartbroken, but I'll know the motherly love I have was given the space it needed during this time.

I just needed to rant. I feel like I see so many ""I hate to be a Debbie downer BUT..."" comments on many early excited pregnancy posts, and I just wanted to be the positive voice. We are all scared, we are all anxious, and we all know the odds!!! We know the worst case scenario! But I refuse to let that energy into this pregnancy.

Getting dressed is so difficult. Im simultaneously excited to see my baby grow but feel embarrassed to be visibly pregnant. 

My parents came into town to visit today. I dont have the best relationship with my mom, its been strained since childhood. (Shes narcissistic and a little emotionally immature). Ive been in therapy for years to heal from abuse and work on maintaining healthy boundaries with my family.

Visit was going good until she reached out to touch my stomach at lunch. I reflexively jumped in my seat and loudly said NO. She looked genuinely confused, THEN asked if she could feel baby. I again said no. I felt like I was going to crawl out of my skin and felt a primal sense of protection? I felt rage.

She then said well I can when you get bigger and baby is kicking. I again said no, I do not want to be touched I dont like being touched. She again repeated that she could. 

I really dont want people touching me other than my husband. This is the first time its happened and now Im so anxious that its just the first time. 

Im an autonomous person with a body that is mine&how do I kindly lay these boundaries when all I feel like doing is screaming? I dont want to overreact but no is no. This is my body and my baby. 

I know a lot of this is my hormones. (A degree is past childhood trauma, Ill check in with my therapist about this in a couple days).

I would describe my husband as a pretty stoic, rational man. He doesnt really give in to negative emotions, generally is able to stay on the positive side of things. He is pretty indifferent to small daily stressors, not overwhelmed easily. Pretty even keel. 

Well he dropped a bomb on me the other day that he is really struggling with not feeling important or a priority during the pregnancy. That his feelings are responsible for him not showing me affection and being distant lately. His justification for these feelings are based off a casual conversation we had a month ago where he said he felt like he was on the back burner to which I agreed. I said it sucks but yeah you kind of are, Im the one thats pregnant. The focus needs to be on me and the baby. 

Apparently he had been feeling badly for some time before he brought it up a month ago and said that the conversation just confirmed what he was feeling so he just decided to harbor negative feelings and allow them to change the way he interacted with me. But he let me leave that conversation feeling like things were resolved and led me to believe we were in a good place. 

I feel pretty blindsided. Hes done this before, concealed feelings and let them negatively impact our relationship and then it all kinda blows up. Im due in less than 3 weeks, why did he have to do this now??? 

Anyway idk Im questioning everything. Im feeling like my sacrifices have been all for naught and Ive not been appreciated or acknowledged for anything Ive done. Youd think I was abusive or something toward him or putting all the responsibility on him. I havent been. Ive still been working, taking care of the household, shopping, etc. even though its been such a struggle. I try not to even ask him for things because I feel like a burden. 

Im in so much pain lately and trying to mentally and physically prep for birth and Im getting hit with this crap right now. I mean what was I supposed to do, coddle him this entire time? I just dont really understand it. Im just so tired and dont know where to go from here. I dont even feel like talking to him about it or fighting about it. 

Ironically enough, I had just written him a heartfelt letter and put together a box of all his favorite snacks to give him before the baby is here.. I hadnt even had the chance to give it to him yet before he finally decided to be honest about his feelings. Ugh.

I am getting through week 18 and out of the blue I started getting rashes after touching my dog. Specifically after she spends time leaning onto me (fur touching my arm or leg skin). 
My arm or thigh will get all red with bumps (looks exactly like an allergic reaction). This will not happened if I only touch her with the palms of my hand. 

I have lived with my pup for over 15 years and have never had any reactions to her. She gets bathed regularly and nothing has changed in how i take care of her. 
Could this be a pregnancy thing? Has this happened to any of you? Did you develop any weird new allergies while pregnant? Did they go away?

2025-03-16,1742101915.0,I think Im having a miscarriage. Help please,"Hello,

Im going to give a detailed account of my experience. I may share unnecessary information, but thats because I dont know much about pregnancy or miscarriages.

Im 35. This is my first pregnancy. I removed my IUD 6 months ago but only last month my partner and I checked when was my fertile period and then had sex multiple times around that time.

We were very surprised I got pregnant. It felt easy, since it was the first time we really tried.  It felt very unexpected.

I discovered the pregnancy 5 days ago, and that should have been when it was a little less than 4 weeks long.

The miscarriage:
Day 1: 2 days ago I had some very brown discharge, what look exactly like what I get a day before my period. Later that day I got a little more and what looked like some very dark blood. The quantities seem small, not enough to fill a pad, but also seem a bit more than what I read that was normal to happen. I was supposed to be in the implantation phase.

Together with that I felt constant but very mild cramps. No other pains. I tested again to make sure I was pregnant. I had 3 positive tests already.

Day 2: I had very mild cramps also most of the day, and some very brown discharge in the morning. Maybe enough to cover half of a panty protector type of pad, those small ones.

Day 3: I woke up early this morning feeling still really mild cramps. When I went to pee I noticed very little drops of very dark or brown blood, like spotting, on the toilet paper. A couple drops in the toilet water. 

This is the entire situation. This doesnt look good at all, but I also didnt had any red, or mid period like blood coming out. The tiny cramps feel like something is cooking in my uterus, in a bad way. 

I honestly still dont feel like I had a miscarriage, but all the facts point towards the high chance that its already on the way. Mostly because I seem to have had 4x a higher volume of spotting than the usual, and these damn constant, often hard to notice cramps. Sometimes I feel like Im imagining them because I focus so much at that part of my back.

I am okay (as much as one can be) with the possibility of having a first miscarriage. I know how common these are, they happened so much around me already. And Im honestly already so relieved that my partner and I can conceive. My struggle now is not knowing for sure that the pregnancy is gone. Between the first spotting and then several hours without any spotting yesterday, I went from being almost sure it was going to be a loss to hopeful that maybe that was just the implantation symptoms. Maybe I was spotting more than usual because I do get very heavy period the first 2 days of a period.

Anyway, I of course tried to reach out to a doctor on Friday, when this first started, but couldnt get a hold of one. If anyone here lives in the Netherlands, youll know the struggle.

And I know nobody - other than doctors - can really tell me what is happening for sure, but I would still like to kindly ask for anyone who has similar experiences to share any information that you believe may help me.

And to anyone going through a miscarriage, I hope you have the support of people you love. For what I can tell so far, thats the most important.

2025-03-16,1742127540.0,Worried about my partners mental health (CW loss),"
Im currently 11 weeks pregnant, this is our third pregnancy after a MMC at 13 weeks and a chemical last year. We are now reaching the timeframe we lost our first baby (it passed away at 11.5 weeks). Last week we were told the baby has an enlarged NT which can mean an increased chance of chromosomal abnormalities, were currently (very) anxiously waiting for our NIPT results.

My partner is South African, anyone who knows Afrikaans men will tell you theyre often very traditional and keep to the more classic macho traits. My partner doesnt talk about his feelings - unless hes had a good amount to drink. 

I know my partner struggles with the fact that I obviously feel everything and am so heavily impacted by this pregnancy, he feels kind of on the sideline just waiting to be told how things are going. When I try and talk to him about the pregnancy his response is pretty much always Im sure itll be fine this time. 

On top of that, he doesnt seem that happy with his own stuff. Hes been very demotivated at work for a while. Hes normally very active and also a bit of a thrill seeker, and enjoys a lot of riskier sports. Since our first pregnancy, he quit the riskier stuff, but also hasnt really been enjoying the gym either. He also reads a lot of very negative content online lately and expresses his anger at the state of the world. We currently live in quite a rough area of town, we are moving to the countryside this summer but I know living in this area is also not helping. 

Anyway, over the past few weeks Ive noticed his drinking increase quite a lot. We spoke about it last night and he said he was aware of it, but that he was just so f*cking bored with life at the moment. Obviously with house and baby I was sad to hear this because, although right now life is a little monotonous, we have so much to look forward to. He insisted his feelings were nothing to do with me or our relationship, just the monotony of daily life right now. 

I dont know what to do. He said its not my problem to fix, that he needs to sort himself out. But I cant help but feel really sad about this, on top of the continued pregnancy anxiety, Im really worried about his headspace. Maybe this is how his anxiety comes out, since he doesnt show much emotion in any other capacity. Hes just not the type of person to go speak to someone, so Im not sure how else he can get help.

I'm currently 10w3d and experienced severe nausea and vomiting since about 5 weeks (6 weeks on the dot with the vomiting). I was given Reglan that improved it for a couple days before doing nothing at all besides give me shakiness in my muscles, so I stopped. I got to the point of throwing up about 3-5 times a day and always after a solid meal, went to the ER at 8 weeks because severe dehydration was causing my back and ab muscles to cramp so bad I legitimately thought I had an ectopic (I was also spotting a bit prior), they confirmed baby was progressing as expected with a strong heartbeat and textbook structure/size. They gave me a few days worth of Zofran but my doctor refused to refill because he hadn't seen me yet. Regardless, Zofran was effective for only most of those days but did not stop the puking altogether and the last day I had it, it felt like it did nothing. The nausea was getting worse so out of pure desperation I took the Reglan again and dealt with the unwanted symptoms.

I want to say my nausea peaked (so far) last Wednesday night, I threw up/dry heaved 9 times that day, had an absolute delirious mental episode and considered going to the ER before I eventually just passed out on my bed. Thursday hitting the 10 week mark, I felt *slightly* better but still puking. Friday, puked 3 times. Yesterday once, all acid though, but more bone tired than usual like it was a trade off- first time having solid food since Wednesday.  I never stopped actually being nauseous all day even throughout this. 

This morning my nausea resembled more hunger pains than an actual urge to puke. I feel far more lucid. I don't want to jinx myself, I've been fooled before, but I am at the moment feeling 80% more ""normal."" I've been warned about sudden ends to symptoms as something potentially bad, especially since I read that most people reach their peak nausea symptoms around 10 weeks *if* it's a first trimester thing only, and lasting until 12-14 weeks. 

I guess I'm just looking for a peace of mind. I'm not even sure if I should really call my current symptoms progression as a gradual improvement since the nausea never wavered until literally just this morning. I'm holding on the hope that my boobs are still sore and I'm still sluggish that maybe this is actually a good sign and not something to be concerned about.

I get my first scan Thursday so I really won't know anything until then.

2025-03-16,1742122461.0,Spotting due to medication or a pregnancy,"Spotting due to medication or potential pregnancy

Hi all,

I am 40 and my wife is 36.

We have an 8 year old and my wife got an IUD fitted 7.5 years back.

Also, we had been having unprotected sex since then.

She has a regular 28 day cycle (had never missed any except for during her first pregnancy earlier) and had a last due date on March 6th.

We consulted a gynaec and did a pregnancy check with an hcg test on the 9th (3 days from her due date that came out negative).

But there was a confusion as she had experienced some sensitivity and increase in her size of her breasts (from the 3rd day onwards).

She was prescribed deviry 10 mg to resume her menses for 5 days.

It was the 5th and last day of the medication yesterday and she has observed a bit of spotting day before yesterday and today.

If the spotting is considered a side effect of deviry (and that her regular periods can be expected anytime within the next 7-10 days), is there a possibility that she is still pregnant if the periods do not resume in this scenario.

Please share your opinions.

2025-03-16,1742122119.0,Emotional Rollercoaster,"**TLDR:** ***Ive had a lot of physical, emotional, and mentally challenging issues during my pregnancy; and really need some advice or reassurance. If you can share anything, please do. Im sorry its so long, I tried to trim everything down but theres just so much.***

My pregnancy has been more of an emotional rollercoaster than I even thought it could be. Im currently due June 2nd, and Im not sure what all to expect with the last couple months. 

In the first half of my pregnancy, I was diagnosed with HG and was throwing up constantly and unable to keep food or medication down, resulting in me losing around thirty pounds within the first trimester. It was incredibly hard for me and my husband. If I hadnt known I was pregnant I wouldve thought I had cancer or some serious illness. 

We were waiting to tell our families in person, but we live out of state. Just before we went to see them we had our first ultrasound, and got to see the baby for the very first time. It was incredible, and breathtaking. It made it all feel so worth it. I was so glad to see my sickness wasnt effecting him like I was worried it was. 

We finally got to tell our families we were pregnant around week 14, for Thanksgiving. It was absolutely beautiful, and something Ill remember the rest of my life.

Immediately following Thanksgiving, I got incredibly sick, on top of my HG situation. Some sort of respiratory sickness they couldnt put a name on, and couldnt give me medication for at first. For one week, I really thought I was going to die I was so ill. On top of the HG, I couldnt breathe, had severe chest pains that I even went to the ER for because I got so scared, was coughing so hard it made me cry and vomit. It was so painful. I had a mental breakdown, and truly thought the baby might not make it. They ended up finally giving me medication to help at least a little. It took another week to feel like it was getting better.

I was able to get a couple of days at work that week. I had been missing most days of work for two months. I came home on December 12th, and my beloved kitty got her wings that night. It was my first true loss, and it was really hard. 

That next week we found out that we are having a boy, and getting to share the news with family and my husband is something I will cherish forever. It was so wonderful. 

Over Christmas, my HG finally seemed to be letting up. It was amazing. I ate food for the first time in months that wasnt rice or bread. We stayed home instead of seeing family because it had made me so so sick last time, and to spend time with our other pets. It was beautiful, and it even snowed a tiny bit.

Come new years, my HG was back, but my belly was starting to show and we had gotten to see him on ultrasound again. I tried to push through and make it to work. My boss pulled me aside and told me that I whod been missing too much, even with everything going on. That they understood, but if I missed or called out one more day within 8 weeks they would take me to part time and cut my benefits. They acted like I was just staying home because I wanted to and not because I was horribly sick. We were running out of our savings, it wasnt like I didnt need to be there, I couldnt. Adding an entire new stress to my situation. 

We get our 20 week anatomy scan mid January. They were unable to see his face, with his arms up, and needed to get another scan soon to try to check for cleft. They are unable to see his heart fully. They tell me they also saw what may be a tumor is his brain, and will check it again next time. At this point theyve been taking blood and urine samples every time I come in. My white blood cell count is double what it should be and had been that way since I got sick at Thanksgiving. They let me know they are sending me to a specialist but not to worry. I am definitely worried for my little guy.

They schedule me a few more weeks out for another ultrasound. I try to make it to work, as Im in fear of losing my benefits so close to birth. Im throwing up multiple times a day and having to leave my desk constantly. Theyre upset Im not able to grab someone to cover the desk on my way to run to the restroom to vomit. Theyre upset I seem sick, tired, and on the verge of tears at the front desk. Not a good look for them. Exactly why Ive been staying home. 

They got my results back and tell me I might have small kidney stones and to drink a ton of water to try to flush them out. Super easy request seeing as Im still throwing up multiple times a day. 

The specialist is an oncologist. They are watching me to see if I have leukemia. Didnt know that until I literally am sitting in the oncologist office, and shes the one to tell me why Im there. I get they didnt want me to worry. But Im starting to feel like Im falling apart.

Im finally feeling his kicks and movements. Its bringing me a lot of peace, and its so wonderful to feel like hes okay in there. We get our ultrasound and no tumor, no cleft and no heart defect. thank God. We started getting stuff for the nursery and putting things together. The HG is getting lighter. Only a few days a week Im throwing up. I feel like I can truly see the beautiful light at the end of the tunnel.

I developed this cyst in my right breast, that grew from a dime size to about the size of a clementine, and was so incredibly painful. It got red and swollen until it was purple. Again they didnt want to give me antibiotics and there was nothing I could do but put a compress on. I couldnt even wear a bra. I had to keep going to work or they would drop my benefits. Eventually the cyst burst on its own and all this puss came out. It drained for three days. They had to express it further and finally put me on antibiotics. I had that open wound on my breast for about a week, and kept having to rewrap it, to the point the tape was tearing little parts of my skin off. But it did finally heal. 

This past week, Tuesday I wake up with some sort of respiratory situation again. My throat is so sore I cant swallow and have a fever. They still want me to come into work, so I do. 

We woke up Wednesday morning to my beloved dog Sam having some neurological symptoms, and we had to lay her to rest on Wednesday. After thirteen beautiful years. This is the hardest thing Ive ever been through. 

I try to go to work Thursday, but I was so broken I just left. I told my boss I couldnt be here, I couldnt even think. Theyre probably going to fire me. I dont even care anymore. I cant deal with all of this. Im now so incredibly sick, coughing things up, sore throat, drainage etc; if I could, I wouldnt go in to work tomorrow either. 

Please: I need some advice. Any advice. If you been through a rough pregnancy or grieving while going through this, please let me know how you made it. I feel like Im trying my best to keep my head held high but its one thing after another, like waves crashing down on my head and I cant catch my breath.

I have genuinely not changed my calorie intake from pre-pregnancy and I think that's what's so frustrating to me. I eat the same portions, and haven't had intense cravings or anything along those lines. But I'm still gaining weight. 

The big problem is up until 3 weeks ago, my blood pressure was normal! No issues whatsoever. I monitor it at home and at the doc appts of course. Now, at 30 weeks pregnant it is high and stressing me out. 140s/80s. 

On top of that I have failed both 1 hr glucose tests I was given by 10mg and even though I already passed my first 3 hr glucose test, I have to go in for a 2nd one tomorrow. I'm terrified of failing it. 

The rational part of me knows that this is related to the pregnancy but I keep hearing stories of women who started getting high blood pressure during pregnancy and it never went away and now they've been on meds for 10+ years. 

But I'm scared of what gestational diabetes AND high blood pressure may result in for me and my baby in these final weeks.

2025-03-16,1742144236.0,6 week ultrasound questions,"Hi everyone, I (m, 30) and my wife (f, 27) found out were pregnant around a month ago. My wife would have been around 6 weeks and 4 days today. 

Unfortunately, she began having intense bleeding a few days ago (at around 6 weeks). We went to the hospital, worrying that it might be ectopic. They did an ultrasound and could barely see the gestational sac. They couldnt visualize a yolk or pole. They told us she was 5 weeks and 3 days pregnant by the imaging and that her HCG levels were relatively low for 6 weeks (around 830). They told us that the bleeding indicated that shes likely miscarrying. She had intense bleeding and was releasing clots for the last few days, but its just spotting now. Her pregnancy symptoms kind of just went away. All of these signs made us think that she already passed the tissue. 

Today, we went for a follow up with her ob-gyn and the sac wasnt just there, but it got larger. The yolk was a bit more visualized today although no embryo was seen. She couldnt see the pole. We were so confused but the doctor said that shes 99.9% sure that shes going to pass the tissue anyway. They took her bloodwork today as well to get some more insight. 

Now, my concern is two fold: 
1) is it likely that she wont be able to pass the tissue herself? What happens then? If the sac is still present and its growing, what does that mean? Is it a blighted ovum? 

2) is there any scientifically reasonable chance shes still pregnant? We were very upset the last few days and my wife just got over the fact that she likely miscarried, but after the ultrasound today, were both in an even more anxious mood, worrying she hasnt passed the tissue.

We're anxious as we're just finishing up university this summer. He's been working part time for a year already and he's going to go full time as soon as we're done with our thesis, but we're worried about money a little bit. We do have a place to live where we don't pay rent so that's sorted.
We're also scared about our families' reactions as we really don't know how they'll take the news when we decide to share.
I guess I'm just looking for a little bit of encouragement? Any other young mums that made it and can share their positive experiences? Is it normal to feel both on top of the world and severely anxious that we're too young and not ready at the same time?

I'm 9 weeks today. Supposedly. 
I'm freaking out constantly that maybe it's already gone. 
This is my third pregnancy, the first made it to 8 weeks but didn't develop past 7. Ended in a d&amp;c. The second made it to 7 and had a miscarriage on my own but I knew it was coming because my blood work wasn't great. 
This one I found out about on Valentine's. I'm not going to lie the timing couldn't be worse, 2 weeks after my due date is my brother's wedding that my husband is the best man in, I'm in the bridal party, and it's all happening at my parents house 4 hours away. But I still want this so bad. 
My husband is very encouraging and says we will keep trying as long as it takes but I'm 37. 
I have two different doctors, my normal gyno doesn't do babies anymore so she recommended my OB. I haven't seen the OB this pregnancy yet, I'm supposed to have an appointment this Wednesday and an ultrasound Thursday. I'm now freaking out because I went to look at the times and they're not showing up in the app anymore so if they got cancelled I'm going to cry. 
My normal gyno ordered blood work Feb 19 that was great and an ultrasound on Feb 26th that was also right on track. 
But I am not having morning sickness at all, maybe I'm just lucky. My breasts are tender and I'm extra gassy and very emotional and tired. But that's all my symptoms. It's making me so nervous. I keep wanting to like just keep taking pregnancy tests or something. How do you get over not knowing if it's ok or not? 
Like eventually they move and stuff so I imagine that will be reassuring. But if it's still there this is the furthest I've ever been but I just don't know if it's still there. 
I'm so sorry this is just a ramble. My Brain is fried, my therapist is out of town for a few weeks, I'm having a time haha.

Im not too sure what to do here. Im at 20 weeks, so far everything has been great during this pregnancy, but it seems the last two weeks my health is going haywire. The baby is perfectly fine, which Im super happy about. 

Recently got diagnosed with GD at 18 weeks. My blood pressure recently has been elevated, 152/90 as of 3/14. Ive never had high blood pressure before. Last appointment (last week) was 140/60. And my heart rate wont rest below 113. My thyroid levels are also way off (had It removed a couple years ago due to cancer), which they think might be throwing off my heart rate. 

Ive been doing so good with the GD and diet and all that, but now the BP is another obstacle I need to figure out. I did the urine test early on and passed it so preeclampsia wasnt a worry. Theyre having me do it again to see if preeclampsia is now a factor. I dont have any hand or foot swelling and no headaches. 

Has anyone had to deal with GD and HBP during pregnancy? Was there anything you were able to do to help with the HBP? Im going to attempt to cut out a looooot of salt from my diet to see if that helps at all. Ive also only been drinking water since week 16 when I failed the one hour glucose test in case it became a concern later on. 

Im sorry if this seems like its everywhere. My brain is a giant scrambled egg right now with everything going on >r

2025-03-16,1742150634.0,Im scared of getting pregnant&.,"TW: mention of abuse, miscarrying, mental health, etc. 

Hey yall&.let me start off with this. I know a lot of pregnancies dont have bad things happen during them. 

I (22 F), and my fiancé (23 M), have been talking about children and how many we want and how we want to raise them since forever. Weve been together since I was 18. 

But, Ive started thinking.  What if my pregnancy doesnt go as planned? Theres sooooo many things that could go wrong bc of&well everything. Im terrified of the idea of getting pregnant. Im scared. I want a baby with my spouse so badly though within the next year or two. But Im terrified. What if I fail my baby? What if I miscarry. What if baby grows incorrectly or they are born with a disability (Id still love them dw). What if they grow outside of the womb? What if&&the list goes on and on and on. 


And Ive thought about it all. I miscarried (BD killed it) at 16. Ive talked to my OGBYN and asked if she thought I was infertile because of this. She said she doubts it. Also. My fiancé made a joke the other day. That he would freaking leave me if I was infertile. Now Im even more scared. 


How would he handle it if I gave birth to an unhealthy baby. Or if I have issues with miscarrying babies? My grandmother miscarried a baby boy before my mom was born. Im so scared. I just dont know. Id be devastated if I just couldnt&have children. Also the world we are in today scares me just as much. I was talking with finance about it. Especially about a baby girl. I had a really hard childhood. I had an alcoholic abusive father. I was SA multiple times by multiple men. I was almost trafficked. I have been attacked, I went through substance abuse. I got in a bad crowd. Stuffed with mental health and still do. 

Am I overthinking all of this? Like I feel like I have every reason to fear the future. But also. The joy a child would bring to my life would be immense. Ive always dreamed of having a big family and being a mother. But&..what if it doesnt go as planned? I just dont know. I know that yall may laugh at this. But its a genuine fear. Please help me calm my nerves or speak sense into me. But please also tell me the truth. Did any of yall go through this?

2025-03-16,1742113615.0,Having a rough time with FT pregnancy and scheduling appointments. Freaking out over nothing?,"Not sure if it should be under Need Advice or content warning, but mild talk of possible ectopic/misscaraige, so want to be on the safe side. I guess more of a rant as well.  
EDIT: Anywhere I said Advil, Im not taking advil, its off brand Acetaminophen, I got my name brand drugs mixed up,

FTM (22) here, first knowledge of the pregnancy was an at home test, and we are super excited! Id been trying to find an ob/gyn to get scheduled into, but everyone's booked out till April. Cons of being in a town with no other hospitals for 3+ hours.

For a few weeks, id been having terrible right side cramping, enough to bring me to tears in the middle of the night, and overall soreness in my abdomen. After about two weeks, my husband finally forced me to go to the ER to make sure it wasn't ectopic, my appendix, or some other thing. After an ultra sound, the tech looking confused, and two much more in depth ones, they determined I have two endometrial horns? The doc wasn't too entirely sure, but she said that I have a yolk sack w/ no fetal pole in my right horn, and ""small nonspecific fluid or hemorrhage within the left endometrial horn"", along with my right ovary being 2.6x1.9x2.6, and my left one being 4.1x2.1x3.2.

The docs seemed a little concerned, and gave my pregnancy a 50% viability, and wanted me to come back for a repeat quantitative HCG in 48-72 hours, and wanted another ultrasound in 1 week. I was also put on strict pelvic precautions, with no heavy lifting. They referred me to an OB/GYN in branch and sent me on my way.

We came back 3 days later to do the repeat test, and they didn't put in a lab, no one there knew anything about it, they said that was something for my OB to schedule. The only scheduling I can get anywhere close to the ob is with a nurse practitioner New Patient appointment in two weeks. They'll only check my vitals and get me into the system as a patient, a 15 min appointment. I wont even be able to see a doctor. The one they referred me to was on maternity leave, and the only doctor with any slots open was available for mid April, but I cant be scheduled for that at all until my new patient. I cant get in for an ultrasound unless I go back to the ER and check myself in again, or I wait till April to get myself seen by an ob and assessed.

I'm still in a lot of pain, its been about a week calling all over town and even to other towns, and no one can seem to squeeze me in. I cant really sit comfortably, and I don't know if this is normal cramping and I'm being dramatic or what, but work isn't helping me out either. The ER nurse wrote my precautions on my discharge papers, and gave me a note for work, but they ""don't take doctors notes"" and are trying to argue that pushing and pulling carts is ""not lifting because its PUSHING, duh"". I feel like I'm about to pass out on my shifts, but I don't want to go back to the ER just to be told the exact same thing.

Is first trimester usually this rough? I know the vomiting and the tiredness are normal, I can hardly keep anything down and I sleep for 20 hours a day on my days off, but I just cant shake the feeling that somethings fundamentally wrong. I'm taking Advil, but I'm afraid of taking too much, I've always been an anti drugs (for me) kinda person, and its always been ibuprofen that's worked better for me anyways. Independent practices are just as booked up, and I cant de-stress when I'm hurting this much and worried about the baby being okay. Am I doing something wrong, am I missing something? I feel like no one ever had this much issue so early on,  and complications are either obvious, or happen later and they already have a doctor support system.

my husband and i had been trying for about 7 months. we had a blissfully happy first year of marriage before deciding to try. and everything about our story felt perfect. we had been in mexico days before my birthday having the holiday of our lives (pregnant all along!) and then finding out on my birthday was the most amazing gift. i am obviously beside myself. but i dont want this to be my story. i am generally a positive and resilient person. i struggle with depression so i have to be. i cant let myself back slide or sink. i want to be strong for myself, for my husband (who is just as affected by this loss as i am, i believe that) and my step son. who i have worked so hard with to have a beautiful, loving relationship. 

i need help. i woke up this morning wanting to feel happy it happened instead of sad its over. i feel robbed of the beautiful story, the first baby, the milestones and moments i was looking forward to. i dont know what else to say, im just looking for some sympathy and words of wisdom and encouragement to take on this day with my family feeling joy, gratitude, and hope. =",pregnant,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jcga4o/reframing_my_loss/
