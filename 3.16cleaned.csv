2025-03-16,1742119201.0,"A EU Petition to Make Abortion Easier ><8","Hi everyone! <1

I already posted this a couple of weeks ago, but were *so* close to reaching the set numbers of signatures we need, so I figured I could repost this one last time!

If youre an **EU citizen**, you have the power to make a difference! Theres an official EU petition calling for better access to abortionmaking it safer, legal, and more accessible across Europe. But it needs enough signatures to be considered by the EU.

Please take a moment to sign and share, were *so* close to reaching the set goal!

This is literally all the proof anyone would need to know that PL is only for fetuses, outside of that they don't give a shit. At this point its just say you dont give a fuck about uterus owners and rebrand to pro birth. The closest was glass anyway. Its like theres a genuine disconnect because wdym that you would feel no sympathy from the situation you caused by banning abortion? Craziest part is the comments being like ""oh cause they want to say we don't care about women!"" Clearly you don't, if you did you'd prefer them to be able to access a safe abortion vs one that has a pretty good chance of death.

2025-03-16,1742137126.0,What's wrong with women getting 'unsafe' abortions if abortion is banned?,"I see alot of pro-choicers and people who are 'personally' pro-life but publicly pro-choice bring up this point like they are trying to evoke some kind of pity,sadness or concern for the mothers who will be getting illegal unsafe abortions.

As a pro-lifer who thinks abortion is murder and mothers who commit abortions are murderers, I fail to see the point here. This may sound hard-hearted and unsympathetic but I couldn't give a hoot if any adverse complications arise when a woman is getting an illegal unsafe abortion. They are trying to murder a child for fk sake 

Similarly, if an armed mugger,murderer, rapist or pedophile gets harmed while committing such atrocity, I couldn't give a two-bit shit.

This would be now the second time shes aborted our child and Im so mad. My heart aches. Ive pleaded with her to keep the kid. We both have careers, make good money, have family support etc.

The first abortion she told me that she would have an abortion no matter how I felt. That if shes being selfish so be it.
This second time we talked about her having an abortion and or us keeping it. I tried so hard, and now I feel like it was to put my mind at ease. I dont know if I can be with her&she said next time if it was the same time next year. Now I dont think I can ever see myself having children with her.

2025-03-15,1742071655.0,Question about a pro-choice argument,"I am currently debating someone about abortion, and they keep using the 'personhood' argument.

They will usually say a human gets their rights when they are born, because that is when they become a human. I responded to them saying that it is a highly subjective term and shouldn't be used to say whether someone deserves rights or not, since it is not only dangerous to them but can also become dangerous for us becayse anyone can do it to anyone. They said that they believe someone is a person when they are also aware (which is not observable, btw), and that the unborn are therefore not persons.

I always struggle with this one, since it's such a subjective term differing between different people, everyone will give a different answer. Does anyone know a good comeback that works for this argument?",prolife,19.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/prolife/comments/1jc4ruu/question_about_a_prochoice_argument/
2025-03-15,1742065517.0,"Apparently the possibility that a child would grow up (then die) a non-Christian, then spend eternity in Hell justifies murdering them before birth","Heres the argument: 


I assume most Christians here hold the view that God does not judge a non believing fetus the same as a fully grown non believing adult. No matter what for the fetus, he will send the fetus to heaven for eternity with him because the fetus doesn't have the capacity to have a belief in anything. So by this logic, abortion guarantees the soul of the fetus to spend eternity in the kingdom of heaven with God.... If you let the fetus grow up to be a human, statistically they have a large chance of Rejecting God and spending eternity in Hell.... Is it worth it to gamble on this? If you abort the fetus you ensure that soul is sent to heaven. It's the moral thing to do. Some of you might say ""thou shall not kill"", well even if it is, isn't this the ultimate sacrifice for ensuring eternal bliss of another soul in heaven? By this logic abortion is the absolute most moral thing you can do under the sun according to Christianity.

However I do believe that legislation to ban abortions isn't necessarily the most effective as honestly it's very true similarly to drugs that banning it will create more dangerous illegal abortions. So like I think we focus on stuff to improve everyone's standard of living so they feel they can raise a child even if they didn't plan on it? And not encourage abortions.

My bf and I have been together for four years and this  pregnancy was unwanted and unexpected. I have many things that I want to do with my life and I could not see myself raising a child at this age. My mom was a teen mom at 15 and my sister at 17. I thought I was safe after I turned 20 since I truly do believe teen pregnancy is a curse in my family. I found out I was pregnant two weeks ago and I was already 7 weeks I wanted to do my medical abortion as early as possible but I did not want to be at my school alone without any support. I decided to wait for my spring break. I currently just passed the embryo and am laying in bed typing this. I cried at first when I saw it but my brother came to reassure me and told me I was doing the right thing for both the embryo and myself. After going through this process I cannot imagine those who do not have access to this basic reproductive health right. I feel no regret whatsoever and I feel an intense amount of relief. My symptoms were horrible and they were getting in the way of school work etc. I want to thank anyone who ever shared their experience with their medical abortion as I read so many from this group while preparing for mine. ,abortion,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jcg7j8/i_had_my_medical_abortion_and_it_made_me_even/

2025-03-16,1742135836.0,My husband and I are considering a late abortion-Help.,"This is a bit of a long story, but please bear with me.

Im a 31-year-old woman and have been with my husband for 13 years. Together, we have a beautiful 3-year-old son. My first birth was nothing short of traumatizinghe was diagnosed with a kidney condition at 20 weeks, which led to an induction and ultimately an emergency C-section. After his birth, he had to undergo a series of nuclear tests, adding to the trauma. It took me two years and a lot of therapy to begin healing from that experience.

A little over a year ago, we decided to try for a second baby. It took us a year to conceivea year filled with heartbreak and hurdlesbut finally, we had our miracle. Then, at 20 weeks, we received devastating news: our baby was diagnosed with a congenital heart condition, including moderate aortic stenosis and a ventricular septal defect. The uncertainty is crushing.

Although weve been told that our son will most likely live a normal life, we cant help but consider the possibility of termination. The stress, the mental load, and the potential trauma feel overwhelming, and I dont know if I have the strength to go through it again.

Im now 21 weeks. Time feels like its slipping away. I feel him moving, my belly is growing, and yet I find myself questioning everything.

2025-03-16,1742140819.0,Boyfriend forced me to have an abortion &amp; dumped me 2 days later,"I feel so lost, and I dont know how to move forward. My (now) ex-boyfriend pressured me into having an abortion, making me feel like I had no choice. The concerns over the extent of his forcefulness &amp; controlling behaviour were also logged at the time by the medical professionals at the abortion clinic. Two days later, he dumped me over text, told me he never wants to have children with me completely cut me off, and within two weeks, he was posting date night pictures with someone new, as I lay in bed still recovering physically &amp; mentally. He has a narcissistic mother that also blocked me on the day of my surgery and never even acknowledged that I was pregnant. Its just them two, his father is not around &amp; has a completely new family. Its like they both erased me and my baby overnight.

The worst part isI regret it. I didnt want to go through with it, but I was made to feel like I had no choice. I would cancel consultations until he noticed I was doing that so he would start driving me there, I couldnt take the preparation pill for hours but the amount of force I had received, it made me feel like I would be in serious danger if I kept my baby. Now, Im left with this overwhelming grief that I dont know how to process. I feel like a part of me is missing, and I dont know if Ill ever forgive myself. Its hard to function normally when the pain is this heavy. Its been 3 weeks now and I havent eaten a full meal since the day before the surgery, Im signed off work due to my mental health, I dont have any friends as he completely isolated me, and I get no more than 3 hours sleep a night. 

What makes this even harder is that just 10 days before I conceived, I was told I was infertile. Because of my PCOS, one of my ovaries no longer works, and I was led to believe that getting pregnant naturally would be nearly impossible for me. So when I found out I was pregnant, it felt like a miraclesomething I never thought Id get the chance to experience. And now, knowing that I was forced into giving that up, without knowing if Ill ever get another chance, makes the grief even more unbearable.

2025-03-16,1742087777.0,Married and trying to make a joint decision,"i apologize in advance that I am not the best story-teller. I (28)F and my husband (26)M have been married 5 years and have 2 kids already. A boy and a girl. I never wanted more than that. ESPECIALLY with how difficult our youngest has been. I was supposed to be on the birth control patch but I messed up and put it on 48 hours late and now have found myself unexpectedly pregnant. When I first found out I went to my husband and told him bawling my eyes out because we both know we did not want this and let him bring up the option of abortion because we are in Texas, US. At first he seemed on board although, did seem a little emotional about it. (He is very emotional and I am very logical) I went ahead and bought the abortion pull online and had it shipped to a fedex pick-up in New Mexico (only an hour from me ) and picked it up without communicating that to him, but of course wasnt going to take the pills before talking to him one more time. I brought it up again and he said he had talked to a therapist (I had encouraged him to and sent him several therapists in our network) and said when he talked to the therapist, he said that it seemed we both wanted different things but he was just leaving it up to me so that way it didnt ruin our marriage. This is not how I thought he felt at ALL. I knew he felt a little guilt, but I thought he was onboard with my decision. Anyways, the therapist suggested we both write a pros and cons list for having the baby and sit down together and make sure this is a joint decision, which I agree with, but I worry this isnt going to get us anywhere closer to a joint decision and this is obviously a time sensitive situation. So far, my pros list has like 5 very superficial items and my cons list is 30 items long and very valid reasons. I guess I just need someone else to talk to about this. 

A few of my cons:
-I am so close to a huge promotion at my job and a 50% pay raise and I think being pregnant would stop this progression 
-I am the main caregiver for our kids now and I already feel overwhelmed as is. 
-We would have to put a 6 week old in daycare and Ive never had to leave an infant that soon and it gives me anxiety
-We would need a bigger car and I would want a bigger house and camper to accommodate 
-Our youngest is not potty trained and having to change 2 sets of diapers just stresses me out. 
-The world is built for families of 4
-We would be outnumbered. Which brings up a whole other list of things. 
-The world and economy is shit. (Need I say more?)
- We have no village
I could go on and on and on , but I wont 

My 5 pros which carry no real weight in my mind:
-A bigger family at holidays
-Someone for our youngest to play with
-My friend and I would be pregnant together
-I could have the natural birth I wanted with our 2nd
-I could get my tubes tied after since we will reach our deductible
-Special treatment when pregnant =

Ive been steadfast in my decision from the start so I havent been emotional really throughout this process, Im just feeling relieved as I type this. Here is my experience with the medication for anyone whos worried!

Last night around 7pm I took the step 1 pill (mifepristone) by mouth and had no side effects. 

I woke up this morning with my usual morning sickness and then i had my morning coffee and doom scrolled tiktok for a few hours before getting ready to take step 2. I prepped by setting up my bed with my heating pad and a towel to protect my mattress, love island on the tv, snacks, meds within reach and water. I live alone so was alone for the process but kept my best friend updated throughout the day. Heres how my day today went:

11:30: clonazepam x1, ate toast and jam

12:00: Tylenol 3 x2
Naproxen x1

12:25 800 mg misoprostol vaginally

1:05- severe cramps, nausea, light headed, shaky, lasted 15 min

1:15 clonazepam x1

2:00 ate chicken nuggies &amp; smoothie

2:45 mild cramping &amp; heavy bleeding begins (small clot)

3:20 cramping getting worse 

3:45 2 large clots, lots of blood in toilet when went to go pee

4:20 2 more large clots, cramps getting worse again
 
4:25 Tylenol 3 x2

5:00-7:45 nap time. mild- mod cramping

7:45- Carrie scene while walking to bathroom after nap. One more large clot. Straight into shower. 

8:00- all cleaned up, mild cramping, still heavily bleeding

9:00- eat late supper, feeling mostly normal, very mild cramping, moderate-heavy bleeding

Honestly, the worst part was the really bad cramps around 1pm. Passed like 5 med-large clots altogether and used maybe 7 pads over the course of the day. Dont be afraid if you are!

Let me start with the first oral pill, mifepristone. I knew from the start that this first pill doesnt do much only slight cramps. After I took it maybe towards the end of the day i started experiencing on and off cramps which were very mild and made me a little nauseous, thats it, but not to the point where I wanted to throw up. I do have to say though that the next day I was bleeding already and I didnt even take misoprostol yet. Which I called the doctor and they said that its normal. Now the second pill which I took today when I was already bleeding from the first, misoprostol, I had to insert 4 internally.

I had to say it was great I had normal period cramps which are usually nothing to me, maybe 4/10 pain and a lot of bleeding + clots and thats all no nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, etc. It couldnt have been better tbh I got really lucky. I know I normally have a high pain tolerance but I just wanted to share my experience to those who are scared. I was scared at first of course but after my experience I wanted to let you know hoping this will change the way people feel.",abortion,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jce1g4/my_experience_taking_the_pill_for_anyone_whos/
2025-03-16,1742105868.0,MA at 7 weeks. Stopped bleeding today but what to expect next?,"So I am 28 years old, tested positive a few weeks ago and I was having a very healthy pregnancy, the doctor was happy and prescribed me folic acid and everything to continue the pregnancy until I disclosed that I want to terminate because, iJUST GOT MARRIED AMTWO MONTHS AGO!!! So I took the four miso pills vaginally last to last Saturday, and major cramps happened that day itself, passed a tennis ball sized clot and then tissue like stuff spotting for the next 7/8 days and then just stopped bleeding altogether but then day before yesterday i suddenly bled fresh blood and it was quite a lot almost felt like a period, no pain at all tho. 

I woke up today and its completely gone, like I tried to examine my cervical area, not at all bleeding. 

Do I consider this the end of the most uncomfortable experience of my life or this is just click bait for me to open my pad or have sex and act normal and my uterus surprises me something more awful? Will my periods return on time ? ( during my pregnancy I also got diagnosed with mild pcod)

Just had my first appointment to get dilated for my surgical abortion. Everything went well and Im able to continue with the abortion tomorrow. I stopped smoking a day before my scheduled appointment to get dilated. I thought maybe I could hit my vape before my appointment tomorrow which is at 11 AM, right now it is currently 7:19 for me. Would it be safe for me to smoke just a little bit before my appointment tomorrow? This appointment is to get the baby removed completely. I have low iron so Im at higher risk for needing a blood transfusion, but I think the only risk that comes along with smoking before the surgery is infection, but the doctor told me he will be giving me medicine to try to prevent that along with that he will be giving me medicine to help prevent loss of blood and help me with the iron issues.  I know this sounds terrible, but Im very stressed and I just really wanna smoke. Is it possible that I could without ruining the surgery or getting hurt?

2025-03-16,1742127558.0,Post MA and I feel hopeless,"(Throwaway account! Sorry, english is not my first language, pardon my grammar lapses)

Had a successful MA yesterday. Process only took me 4 hours to pass my precious angel. The procedure didnt go very well and heres the context.

March 14,2025
- I asked my live-in partner if he can take a day off this weekend to help me with my MA. I explained and said sorry in advance if I ever sound demanding as this procedure is mentally and emotionally draining for me. He said yes, assured me that he would be there. I already took mifepristone at 11:30am. 
- Later that afternoon, he asked permission if he can report work to fulfill his duties as it was critical for him to decline (hes an engineer and I cant really understand how does his workload looks like on a daily basis) that he also needs to work on Sunday for rotational work. I also told him that I may not understand his workload, but I understand that he needs to focus at work, but the stress hes giving me is just unnecessary.
- As a response, I lashed out on him, voicing out my frustrations and he took it negatively and broke up with me as I was affecting his career.
- At that time, I was really disappointed that he cant fulfill his words.
- ADDITIONAL CONTEXT: 2024 I was at the hospital cause Im about to give birth to our first born, he left me at the hospital for the same reason.. WORK.. that they are understaffed and no one will shoulder his workload. My doctors and midwife even spoke to him to straighten up his priorities as Im in active labor, that they cant proceed with anything unless theres a guardian that can accommodate them if something happens to me, but ofc, as usual, he was really firm with his decision to prioritize his work over his partner. Im new in town and I barely even have friends to ask help with.

March 15 
- at 11:30am already took the first dose of misoprostol and it all came back to me, the abandonment, the neglect from the day I gave birth, and after childbirth, the paternity leave I gave him was just useless, later on I figure out that he didnt disclosed that I was pregnant to his company. And yes, he left me with child care after birth with minimal help as he told me, as he ALWAYS told me that I need to be self-sufficient. And yesterday, it all crashed down on me. The same reason I had to deal with from the times I asked him for help. So I decided to handle things on my own. I went through the process scared, anxious, paranoid and alone.
- He went to work in the morning and went home around 12pm to offer help but my mind is already dysregulated and already disconnected that I refused to receive any help from him. Then he got angry and started shouting and even throwing things inside our room while im actively going through the abortion. Even threatened to hit me but shouted in front of my face instead.
- I was still firm that Im not gonna accept any help from him, the amount of stress that hes giving me is just not helping. So I was left with my 1 year old, crying, doing tantrums while my body is shaking, painfully going through the process. He didnt even bother with child care so I can focus with my process. Idk, hes trying to help but not really helping, shit made me really confused at this point, but oh well, what can I do? I just continued the process with all the emotions that Im feeling. No one to talk to, just trying to seek comfort while watching tiktok clips. 
- 3pm, I was able to finish the procedure and was crying and breaking down for couple of hours after seeing my angel. 
- The next few hours I started bleeding heavily, passing big clots after and cramping so bad that ibuprofen didnt even help to minimize the pain. Fell asleep but woke up around 3am with severe cramping, passed another big clots until dawn. 
- I woke at 3am and I thought It was already done but he even messaged my only friend whos been there for me but was not pro-abortion, telling her that she should check on me as I was doing the abortion. Now my only friend already FOd me as it was against her ethics to tolerate this. I felt betrayed for what he did and disappointed with everything that I just want to die. My grief was beyond comprehension, I just dont understand anything anymore at this point.

March 16
- Post MA today, Im still somewhat heavily bleeding 1 1/2 pads within 2 hours, but I decided to go to the mall as if nothing happened, hoping I can pass out there and die, I was just nauseous and dizzy but still able to walk and even bought groceries for me and my 1 year old baby. 
- I broke down after eating, almost had a panic attack while lining up to the cashier cause I saw a pregnant woman being held by her husband/partner

I just got home and I broke down again. I cant do this anymore, this is just too much for me. My body is trembling and I feel cold. I just dont know how to push forward from here.

i have not bled but only been passing tissue since the MA, and i was able to get them to do an ultrasound when i went to the ER for the concussion. they consulted with my OB/GYN and i have 1.3cm thick tissue on my endometrium retained from the pregnancy. i was given the option of waiting to see if it passes with subsequent periods, but im terrified of retained tissue leading to future pregnancy complications. tried misoprostol again for the tissue and absolutely nothing happened, so they scheduled me for D+E later this week. i am so tired and just want to get to the point where i can cope with the grief and depression and work towards having my life back. 

i made the decision to have the procedure because of this, but im also really do not want to have to go through another traumatic medical experience, especially without support. i have read a lot of others stories about waiting for this tissue to pass for months without any luck. is going through with the D+E worth it? should i wait? please feel free to share experiences in either direction, hope everyone is getting by out there d",abortion,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jcbhj1/rpoc_2_weeks_after_ma_at_105_weeks_de/

2025-03-16,1742130618.0,Cramping on left side 3 weeks after medical abortion,"Hey guys, I need some advice. About 3 weeks ago I had a medical abortion at 6 weeks pregnant. I ordered the pills online, it's my second abortion so I didn't go to a doctor, also just for the simple fact that I have state insurance and it's very hard to find a provider around me that covers the cost of an abortion.

But for the last 2 days, I have had cramping that is specifically on my left side. It radiates to my hip and I can feel it in my leg, butt and back as well. It feels just a tad bit more intense than my normal period cramps but nothing crazy. My bleeding has started lightening up over the past day or 2, but this cramping has just been so consistent over the past 2 days that I'm starting to worry. Last night I decided to take a pregnancy test just to make sure that my hcg levels were going down, but it still came back very positive.

I can say that I did see the sac come out when I had my abortion, so I know that my body dispelled SOMETHING. All of my bleeding was normal and everything had passed. I guess I'm just concerned about a potential ectopic pregnancy? I've never experienced one so I'm not sure what that pain would feel like. The cramping just feels very odd, especially for how directed it is in my left side and it's not just a general cramping feeling in my uterus.

Just figured i'd post on here and ask if anyone has experienced anything like this before taking myself over to the ER to get an ultrasound done....",abortion,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jcl3oj/cramping_on_left_side_3_weeks_after_medical/
2025-03-16,1742146227.0,SA with no Sedation - Positive Experience,"This was not my first abortion, but it was my first surgical. I opted to not do medical this time as I have health anxiety (and GAD), so I disliked the self-regulating aspect of the MA. I also liked the idea of it being over in 10 minutes vs the MAs 10+ hours. I chose to do no sedation honestly because the idea of even partial sedation kind of freaks me out. I liked the idea of being somewhat in control, and I felt like I wouldnt have that with sedation. This is just me though and my weird health anxiety brain. 

Before the procedure: The day of the procedure, my bf and I went to the clinic around 1:15 (apt was 1:30). I was taken for a vaginal ultrasound around 1:45 and they said I was 5wks3days.  Then, I was given an antibiotic and my bp was taken. I then had to wait for the Dr to arrive for about 45 more minutes. 

I was moved to the room and told to undress from the waist down and put a pad in my underwear (for after). I was hoping they would give me an ibuprofen or something before the procedure, but they didnt. Then, I laid down and waited for the nurse to come and set up the instruments. She did and then the other nurses and Dr came in. They were all very chatty and friendly. We kept talking about my decision to not have the sedation: they were telling me that if at any point I changed my mind, we could do it, but I didnt feel pressured at all. I feel like I have a decent pain tolerance after having a chronic ankle injury and heavy periods with a lot of cramps. I was less worried about the pain since it wouldnt last for that long, I was more just nervous/anxious about the whole thing. 

The procedure: At first, the Dr. examined me to check the placement of my cervix (I think). Then, he put in the speculum, and it was cold and honestly kinda pinched, but it didnt hurt really. Then, he gave me the lidocaine injections to my cervix, and they didnt really hurt. I remember them all asking and I said, I just kinda feel my cervix, and they laughed and said that was a good sign. Then, he started with the dilation rod and that hurt! It wasnt 10/10 pain but definitely uncomfortable pain that caused me to kind of kick my legs a little (lol). It definitely hurt every time it happened - it happened maybe 5 times during the procedure and almost felt like he was just moving something around in there. It was maybe 8-9/10 pain but only lasted for 5-10 seconds each time. I just closed my eyes and breathed while trying not to tense up, although I definitely made faces (not really noises other than comments like oh ouch or yeah that kind of hurts). The suction didnt really feel like anything, it was a little uncomfortable and maybe a little painful (2/10) but not as bad as my normal period cramps and not nearly as bad as the other feeling I described above. The whole thing last probably 5-7 minutes and the part after the lidocaine shots (which felt like the real beginning) lasted only about 2-3 minutes. I didnt see anything that came out as I was either looking at the ceiling, had my eyes closed, or was talking to one of the nurses next to my head. During the procedure they also were checking my uterus with an ultrasound on my abdomen, but that I kind of just zoned out and forgot that was happening. They pulled all of the stuff out and it was definitely relieving, not painful at all. It really just felt like I could relax everything down there finally. Then, they said good job and left other than one of the nurses. She brought me my underwear and pants and put them on for me (this part was so awkward lol). I think its the normal procedure if someone gets sedation, but I feel like I could have just done it myself& it was just so awkward lol. I ended up just asking to do it myself and she let me.

After: I felt weak and was cramping a lot after. Other stories I read said that once the procedure was done, all the pain went away, but that wasnt the case for me. I had pretty bad cramps for maybe 5 minutes. Then, they lessened to mild cramps. They had me sit in an inside waiting room and took my blood pressure twice. They gave me a pack of crackers and water, which I took, and also offered an ibuprofen that I declined. I sat there for probably 20 minutes total and then they said I could leave. In total, I was there from 1:15-3:00. 

Now, as Im writing this it had been about 22 hours and the cramping has become almost none. I had mild cramps for maybe an hour after, but I took naproxen and havent had any since. I did wake up nauseous today, which I didnt have during the pregnancy, but it went away fairly quickly. 

Overall, I would probably do the same route again, without the sedation and all, but I would take a naproxen before the procedure since all I had was the lidocaine. I hope that this helps at least one person in feeling better before!! If you have any questions, please ask! Also, Im sorry if this was not well written, Im writing on my phone lol.

2025-03-16,1742147691.0,Medication Abortion - Positive Experience,"Hi all, 25F here, US/North Carolina. I was absolutely terrified to go through with my MA this weekend so I wanted to share my experience in case it helps someone else. 

Some background, I was 5-6 weeks pregnant for my abortion and I am prone to extremely bad menstrual cramps for my normal period, which made me really scared to go through with the misoprostol. In North Carolina, you have to go through a consent appointment 72 hours prior to the abortion, so I did that at a local clinic. It was a bizarre experience where I had an ultrasound, light bloodwork, and counseling (if you can even call it that). 

On Friday I took the mifepristone at the clinic in a room of like 6 other women. I had little to no side effects from the mifepristone, other than emotional effects. I took Naproxen instead of Ibuprofen because it works much better for me, so I started that on Friday. Yesterday I took two rounds of misoprostol (8 pills total). Dissolving them in my mouth was definitely unpleasant but not a huge deal, made my gums kind of sore after. I started cramping within 20-30 minutes and started bleeding about an hour after starting the pills. I took Naproxen an hour before starting the first round and Zofran right before. I prepped with period underwear (dont skip out on this part!) and overnight pads. I had 2 heating pads, one that wraps around my back and one for the front. 

Like I mentioned, my menstrual cramps are horrific normally (Ive taken toradol injections at urgent care for the pain before) and my periods are very heavy (8 days long) so I was worried my abortion pain would be proportional to that, but luckily with the Naproxen and heating pads, it was comparable to a bad period for me. You should definitely prepare to be as sedentary as possible (I found that moving around made the cramps and nausea worse). If you can have someone with you to support you and get anything you need, its a huge help. 

I passed the pregnancy about 4 hours after the first round which is about when I started the second round of misoprostol. I made sure to eat something and drink electrolyte drinks before the second round because the nausea and stomach cramps were pretty bad. I had some diarrhea as well. By the second round of misoprostol, I had already passed the largest clots and it was just a lot of bleeding by that point. I used about 5-6 overnight pads the first night. Make sure you have a heating pad with an automatic timer/shut off so you can go to sleep with it on. I made sure to take another Naproxen before I went to bed at about midnight. Unfortunately, for some reason 12am-3am was kind of the worst of the pain for me, idk if it was the stomach cramps and nausea or what but that was the hardest part, but still not the worst pain Ive ever experienced. By the time I woke up in the morning, the worst of it was over and I didnt need any pain meds anymore. Im still having mild cramping today but overall it had not been NEARLY as bad as I expected. I expected to be crying all night from the pain, but I never got to that point. Here are the items I found most helpful:
- Period underwear
- Thick overnight pads
- Electrolyte drinks (hydration will help your nausea) 
- Wrap around heating pad with automatic shut off timer
- Zofran/anti nausea medication and pain medication that works best for you
- Popsicles and Italian ices (the cold helped my nausea)
- Applesauce and rice (to be able to take the meds) 
- All the distraction items you might need. Video games, books, movies chosen beforehand, etc. 

My DMs are open if anyone has questions about my experience or needs to vent. This was one of the hardest things Ive ever had to go through so Im happy to help you through it.

Before this happened, I had never been on birth control before and I did not feel that I suffered from mood swings surrounding my period. Id have one random cry every month and know it must mean my period was coming. =

Flash forward to September, I got a copper IUD. And immediately felt insanely emotional. Crying spells daily and PMDD that was debilitating. My poor partner, I was an absolute menace. Ive never experienced anger and sadness quite like the six months I had the IUD. 

After things hit a breaking point and I didnt feel my body was adjusting, I got the IUD removed and switched to YAZ. Which is the only birth control Ive found that is supposed to help with PMDD. 

I am three weeks into yaz and while I feel better, I do NOT feel as good as I did pre pregnancy. The week before my period still feels like hell. I am irritable, angry, and cannot stop crying. Ive never experienced PMS like this pre pregnancy. 

Is this a normal response post abortion? Will this get better with time? Is there anything I can do to make the week before my period not absolute hell for everyone involved? ",abortion,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jcfozs/pmdd_post_abortion_tn_usa/

2025-03-15,1742070086.0,"Do Women Have a Moral Duty to Keep Their Bodies ""Ready"" for Reproduction at All Times?","Late last year, Dr. Rebecca Gomperts (Aid Access, Women on Waves) announced results of a large clinical trial in Moldova, testing the use of a weekly low dose of mifepristone (50 mg) as a contraceptive. The results were promising, with only one pregnancy occurring within 2000 cycles. Furthermore, negative side effects were minimal, with only 4% of the participants experiencing any negative side effects (compared to a 40% negative side effect rate for conventional hormonal contraceptives). Additionally, the low-dose mifepristone was easier to use, requiring only one dose a week, and being more ""forgiving"" of variations in the time the pill is taken. And 89% of the study participants reported that they stopped menstruating while taking mifepristone as a contraceptive. (Probably most women would consider this a positive side effect.)

Because of the positive results, the trials have been expanded to the Netherlands this year. If the results continue to be positive, the plan is to apply to the European Medicines Agency for registration and market authorization to allow this weekly, low-dose mifepristone regimen as a contraceptive throughout the EU.

The method of action for mifepristone as birth control is two-fold: it reduces the rate of ovulation and it thins the endometrial lining of the uterus, making it impossible for a fertilized egg to implant.

([Source](https://msmagazine.com/2025/01/07/mifepristone-weekly-contraceptive-clinical-trials-abortion-pill-birth-control/).)

My primary question for PL supporters is this: 

* Would you have any moral or legal objections to women's use of such a contraceptive? If so, on what grounds?

Here are some secondary questions if you believe that the use of this contraceptive would be immoral:

* If a woman was taking mifepristone as described here *as a contraceptive* and informed her partner that she was doing this before they had sex, and if her partner, knowing this, decided to go ahead and have PIV sex with her, and if one of his sperm fertilized an egg but it failed to implant, whose would be the primary responsibility for the ""death"" of the fertilized egg? (Realistically, neither of them would ever know if this happened, so this is a hypothetical question.)
* *Men's* use of tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, red meat, and food high in trans fats during the months before their partners' conception is associated with higher miscarriage rates, because of these substances' impacts on sperm. ([Source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/a-mans-unhealthy-lifestyle-too-can-lead-to-his-partners-pregnancy-loss/articleshow/64072130.cms?from=mdr).)  If men engage in such unhealthy lifestyles, they are not maintaining their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction, and their choices could result in the ""death"" of a fertilized egg or even an embryo or fetus. Do they have a moral duty to maintain their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction by refraining from such lifestyle choices?",Abortiondebate,56.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jc47ep/do_women_have_a_moral_duty_to_keep_their_bodies/
2025-03-16,1742136839.0,Abortion is Absolutely Justified,"Premises:

1. Moral worth is based on current capacity for sentience, as **only sentient beings can experience harm**.

2. A pre-sentient fetus **lacks the ability to experience harm** and has no present interests.

3. Forcing a sentient person to remain pregnant **imposes significant physical, psychological, and emotional harm**.

4. Future potential does not create present moral worth; moral status depends on actual characteristics, **not hypothetical ones**.

5. When a **moral conflict** arises, the entity capable of experiencing harm (the pregnant person) has **greater moral weight** than a non-sentient fetus.

Conclusion:

Before fetal sentience, abortion is morally justified because **there is no meaningful harm to the fetus**, while forcing pregnancy **significantly harms a sentient person**.

2025-03-16,1742088474.0,Who's responsible for a bleached reef?,"This is a thought experiment I'm using to demonstrate an issue I have with the idea of individual responsibility, which is commonly invoked in debates over abortion.

Imagine you're snorkeling on what was once a lively shallow patch reef shortly after a marine heatwave and, depressingly, discover that all of the stony coral bleached and died. 100% mortality. All of the corals died and the system shifted to one dominated by macroalgae and octocorals.

You're upset by this turn of events. You're frustrated, angry, sad. 

You wonder who, if anyone is responsible. YIH wants them to be held accountable.

To determine who's responsible, we have to consider what factors led to the reef bleaching. So, what are those factors?

--

One major and obvious factor was the heatwave. Why was the temperature so high? It was probably in part due to global warming caused by anthropogenic release of greenhouse gases. Further, it was probably exacerbated by [El Niño](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o%E2%80%93Southern_Oscillation).

That's not the whole story, however. For one, local factors such as influence the temperature. These local factors are involved and are influenced by global weather phenomena. 

Further, other factors contribute to bleaching, such as salinity, solar irradiance, disease, and exposure to pollutants. These factors are influenced by a wide array of natural and anthropogenic phenomena. For instance, turbidity and cloud cover impacst how much sunlight corals are exposed to. Some sunscreens are harmful pollutants. Precipitation influences salinity.

Further, various factors, from the abundance of herbivores to the amount of nutrients in the water, influence algal growth and subsequently influence whether or not the system shifts to one dominated by macroalgae.  Those factors are also influenced by a wide array of natural and anthropogenic phenomena.  Fishing can influence herbivore abundance. Pathogens can decimate populations of some herbivores, as happened to longspine urchins in Florida. Nutrients from agriculture can run off into aquatic systems and stimulate algae growth.

Also, the ability of a reef to recover after a mortality event is influenced by the density of surviving corals.  If the density of the surving corals is low, their population growth will be low due to the [Allee effect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allee_effect) and they'll be outcompeted by organisms such as macroalgae.

Finally, some corals are more resistant to stressors such as temperature for reasons that are poorly understood.

--

So, who's ""responsible?"" Who can er hold accountable for the bleached reef? 

You might not think any person or small group is, at least not in the sense of ""ultimate: or ""dole"" responsibility.

You can't isolate any one person's actions and say ""this is ultimately why this event occurred."" The reef bleached because of a complex array of interrelated processes, some of which occur on a global scale.  The actions of some small amount of humans weren't the only factor. 

--

I think many events that we try to hold people responsible for are like this. They occur because of a complex array of interrelated processes. No one person is ultimately responsible for them. Of course, this is the case! The event isn't a part of an isolated system that only involves a singular person.",Abortiondebate,30.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jcage8/whos_responsible_for_a_bleached_reef/
2025-03-16,1742107980.0,Is Catholicism right for me?,"I'm a 17 year old male who was raised a atheist. My father actually taught me to hate Christianity as a whole and for the longest time I have. I even considered myself a satanist when I was 13-14 years old, and as I got older I started learning about religions of the world and when I got to Christianity I fell in love with Catholic culture and the church and the practices and I realized back in November of 2024 that I wanted to be Catholic. I went to church and it felt like a home away from home, I started praying the rosary and when I learned about Carlo Acutis I was sucked in further, and I follow in his was with my extreme love for Mary and Jesus. The Catholic Church is also the founding church and I love how well documented and preserved the history of the church is. Well, my mother was not as happy about it as I was, she doesn't like the church or Christianity and leans to universal Unitarianism and the more and more I've talked about Catholicism with my mother the more she's argued against it.

2025-03-16,1742136501.0,How do I tell my boyfriend I want our daughter to have my last name?,"A little bit of context - I (26F) am 8 months pregnant with my (32M) boyfriends daughter. 

We unexpectedly got pregnant and found out in August of last year. Once we found out, my entire world changed. I obviously stopped drinking, vaping, caffeine, everything to ensure I had a healthy, safe pregnancy (which thankfully I have). My boyfriend struggled with the change. For months, I found him sneaking alcohol behind my back, hiding drinking from me, and being completely irresponsible. We had the talk many times before that if this happened abortion was not an option (for me, I am 100% pro choice though). Here is why: 

I have worked very hard to become financially stable and independent. I purchased my first home at 24 which we live in together (everything is in my name). I have a full time job that I have been at for 3 years with great benefits (including the health insurance that has gotten us 100% through this pregnancy). I work from home and have the ability to keep my daughter home with me once she is born, and 3 months of paid maternity leave. I put money in savings every month and only have a car payment/mortgage. So in my mind, and what we agreed to before, was if I got pregnant we would keep the baby. 

Over the last 8 months, our relationship has really struggled. He has not been supportive or helped me in any way. I have purchased everything for the baby (almost $4,000 worth), paid for our maternity photos, scheduled all the doctors appointments, cooked my own meals, did the nursery alone. All while he was drinking (which he finally says he stopped, I dont have the energy to care anymore), and smoking weed every single day (he still does this). 

I have cried to him many times about the emotional state of our relationship and how I need him at this time but nothing has changed. There is no intimacy in our relationship, and he only cares about himself and the image of having a girlfriend/baby on the way. He owns his own business and does not have health insurance so he contributes nothing (and has NO plan to) for our daughters health. It will all fall on me. 

Im writing to ask, how do I tell him I want her to have my last name? I am terrified our relationship wont last this way, Ive asked about counseling but of course I would have to pay for it. He gets offended when I ask. But I am doing everything for our child. He just feels we are lucky that we wont have to pay for childcare and that Ill breastfeed to save money on formula. But those are still sacrifices I am making, because I will be a full time employee (and bread winner) who is also taking care of our child. 

If our relationship does turn around and we decide to get married one day, it would be much easier to change her last name than to ever get his permission to change it

2025-03-16,1742094446.0,CMV: Eugenics is being practiced in the USA right now and that is a good thing.,"The high rate of abortions following a Down syndrome screening sometimes exceeding 90% i can lead to a significant reduction in the prevalence of the condition. Resembling the effects of eugenics, it reflects a societal bias against disabilities, effectively ""weeding out"" a specific genetic trait.

Eugenics per wikipedia: is a set of beliefs and practices that aim to improve the genetic quality of a human population -&gt;This in itself seems a good ""improving genetic quality of the human population""

Eugenics is stigmatized due to the racist evils of Nazi Germany, but it's goal of improving a populations health and other desirable characteristics is not evil in it's self.

It will obviously need to be controlled but once we can select and screen fetuses and embryos for positive characteristics such as good health (e.g. not having mental or physical illnesses), long life, physical strength, intelligence that will improve society we should and it can be argued it would be immoral to the next generation not to do so e.g. we are treating them poorly

Once genetic selection becomes  a societal norm similar to  how immunizing a child is expected today, It will be seem negligent to opt out, much like skipping vaccines is viewed now.

  
TLDR:  
Downs syndrome screening is eugenics "" a set of beliefs and practices that aim to improve the genetic quality of a human population"".

He owns his own business and does not have health insurance so he contributes nothing (and has NO plan to) for our daughters health. It will all fall on me. 

Im writing to ask, how do I tell him I want her to have my last name? I am terrified our relationship wont last this way, Ive asked about counseling but of course I would have to pay for it. He gets offended when I ask. But I am doing everything for our child. He just feels we are lucky that we wont have to pay for childcare and that Ill breastfeed to save money on formula. But those are still sacrifices I am making, because I will be a full time employee (and bread winner) who is also taking care of our child. 

If our relationship does turn around and we decide to get married one day, it would be much easier to change her last name than to ever get his permission to change it

This may sound hard-hearted and unsympathetic but I couldn't give a hoot if any adverse complications arise when a woman is getting an illegal unsafe abortion.

Similarly, if an armed mugger,murderer, rapist or pedophile gets harmed while committing such atrocity, I couldn't give a two-bit shit.

I assume most Christians here hold the view that God does not judge a non believing fetus the same as a fully grown non believing adult. No matter what for the fetus, he will send the fetus to heaven for eternity with him because the fetus doesn't have the capacity to have a belief in anything. So by this logic, abortion guarantees the soul of the fetus to spend eternity in the kingdom of heaven with God.... If you let the fetus grow up to be a human, statistically they have a large chance of Rejecting God and spending eternity in Hell.... Is it worth it to gamble on this? If you abort the fetus you ensure that soul is sent to heaven. It's the moral thing to do. Some of you might say ""thou shall not kill"", well even if it is, isn't this the ultimate sacrifice for ensuring eternal bliss of another soul in heaven? By this logic abortion is the absolute most moral thing you can do under the sun according to Christianity.

2025-03-15,1742070086.0,"Do Women Have a Moral Duty to Keep Their Bodies ""Ready"" for Reproduction at All Times?","Late last year, Dr. Rebecca Gomperts (Aid Access, Women on Waves) announced results of a large clinical trial in Moldova, testing the use of a weekly low dose of mifepristone (50 mg) as a contraceptive. The results were promising, with only one pregnancy occurring within 2000 cycles. Furthermore, negative side effects were minimal, with only 4% of the participants experiencing any negative side effects (compared to a 40% negative side effect rate for conventional hormonal contraceptives). Additionally, the low-dose mifepristone was easier to use, requiring only one dose a week, and being more ""forgiving"" of variations in the time the pill is taken. And 89% of the study participants reported that they stopped menstruating while taking mifepristone as a contraceptive. (Probably most women would consider this a positive side effect.)

Because of the positive results, the trials have been expanded to the Netherlands this year. If the results continue to be positive, the plan is to apply to the European Medicines Agency for registration and market authorization to allow this weekly, low-dose mifepristone regimen as a contraceptive throughout the EU.

The method of action for mifepristone as birth control is two-fold: it reduces the rate of ovulation and it thins the endometrial lining of the uterus, making it impossible for a fertilized egg to implant.

([Source](https://msmagazine.com/2025/01/07/mifepristone-weekly-contraceptive-clinical-trials-abortion-pill-birth-control/).)

My primary question for PL supporters is this: 

* Would you have any moral or legal objections to women's use of such a contraceptive? If so, on what grounds?

Here are some secondary questions if you believe that the use of this contraceptive would be immoral:

* If a woman was taking mifepristone as described here *as a contraceptive* and informed her partner that she was doing this before they had sex, and if her partner, knowing this, decided to go ahead and have PIV sex with her, and if one of his sperm fertilized an egg but it failed to implant, whose would be the primary responsibility for the ""death"" of the fertilized egg? (Realistically, neither of them would ever know if this happened, so this is a hypothetical question.)
* *Men's* use of tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, red meat, and food high in trans fats during the months before their partners' conception is associated with higher miscarriage rates, because of these substances' impacts on sperm. ([Source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/a-mans-unhealthy-lifestyle-too-can-lead-to-his-partners-pregnancy-loss/articleshow/64072130.cms?from=mdr).)  If men engage in such unhealthy lifestyles, they are not maintaining their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction, and their choices could result in the ""death"" of a fertilized egg or even an embryo or fetus. Do they have a moral duty to maintain their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction by refraining from such lifestyle choices?",Abortiondebate,56.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jc47ep/do_women_have_a_moral_duty_to_keep_their_bodies/
2025-03-16,1742136839.0,Abortion is Absolutely Justified,"Premises:

1. Moral worth is based on current capacity for sentience, as **only sentient beings can experience harm**.

2. A pre-sentient fetus **lacks the ability to experience harm** and has no present interests.

3. Forcing a sentient person to remain pregnant **imposes significant physical, psychological, and emotional harm**.

4. Future potential does not create present moral worth; moral status depends on actual characteristics, **not hypothetical ones**.

5. When a **moral conflict** arises, the entity capable of experiencing harm (the pregnant person) has **greater moral weight** than a non-sentient fetus.

Conclusion:

Before fetal sentience, abortion is morally justified because **there is no meaningful harm to the fetus**, while forcing pregnancy **significantly harms a sentient person**.

Resembling the effects of eugenics, it reflects a societal bias against disabilities, effectively ""weeding out"" a specific genetic trait.

Eugenics per wikipedia: is a set of beliefs and practices that aim to improve the genetic quality of a human population -&gt;This in itself seems a good ""improving genetic quality of the human population""

Eugenics is stigmatized due to the racist evils of Nazi Germany, but it's goal of improving a populations health and other desirable characteristics is not evil in it's self.

It will obviously need to be controlled but once we can select and screen fetuses and embryos for positive characteristics such as good health (e.g. not having mental or physical illnesses), long life, physical strength, intelligence that will improve society we should and it can be argued it would be immoral to the next generation not to do so e.g. we are treating them poorly

Once genetic selection becomes  a societal norm similar to  how immunizing a child is expected today, It will be seem negligent to opt out, much like skipping vaccines is viewed now.

  
TLDR:  
Downs syndrome screening is eugenics "" a set of beliefs and practices that aim to improve the genetic quality of a human population"".  
This itself is a good and is tainted by a history of racism and discrimination which doesn't need to apply to eugenics in future. Though obvious caution and safeguards should be applied

Im a 31-year-old woman and have been with my husband for 13 years. Together, we have a beautiful 3-year-old son. My first birth was nothing short of traumatizinghe was diagnosed with a kidney condition at 20 weeks, which led to an induction and ultimately an emergency C-section. After his birth, he had to undergo a series of nuclear tests, adding to the trauma. It took me two years and a lot of therapy to begin healing from that experience.

A little over a year ago, we decided to try for a second baby. It took us a year to conceivea year filled with heartbreak and hurdlesbut finally, we had our miracle. Then, at 20 weeks, we received devastating news: our baby was diagnosed with a congenital heart condition, including moderate aortic stenosis and a ventricular septal defect. The uncertainty is crushing.

Although weve been told that our son will most likely live a normal life, we cant help but consider the possibility of termination. The stress, the mental load, and the potential trauma feel overwhelming, and I dont know if I have the strength to go through it again.

Im now 21 weeks. Time feels like its slipping away. I feel him moving, my belly is growing, and yet I find myself questioning everything.

I (28)F and my husband (26)M have been married 5 years and have 2 kids already. A boy and a girl. I never wanted more than that. ESPECIALLY with how difficult our youngest has been. I was supposed to be on the birth control patch but I messed up and put it on 48 hours late and now have found myself unexpectedly pregnant. When I first found out I went to my husband and told him bawling my eyes out because we both know we did not want this and let him bring up the option of abortion because we are in Texas, US. At first he seemed on board although, did seem a little emotional about it. (He is very emotional and I am very logical) I went ahead and bought the abortion pull online and had it shipped to a fedex pick-up in New Mexico (only an hour from me ) and picked it up without communicating that to him, but of course wasnt going to take the pills before talking to him one more time. I brought it up again and he said he had talked to a therapist (I had encouraged him to and sent him several therapists in our network) and said when he talked to the therapist, he said that it seemed we both wanted different things but he was just leaving it up to me so that way it didnt ruin our marriage. This is not how I thought he felt at ALL. I knew he felt a little guilt, but I thought he was onboard with my decision. Anyways, the therapist suggested we both write a pros and cons list for having the baby and sit down together and make sure this is a joint decision, which I agree with, but I worry this isnt going to get us anywhere closer to a joint decision and this is obviously a time sensitive situation. So far, my pros list has like 5 very superficial items and my cons list is 30 items long and very valid reasons. I guess I just need someone else to talk to about this. 

A few of my cons:
-I am so close to a huge promotion at my job and a 50% pay raise and I think being pregnant would stop this progression 
-I am the main caregiver for our kids now and I already feel overwhelmed as is. 
-We would have to put a 6 week old in daycare and Ive never had to leave an infant that soon and it gives me anxiety
-We would need a bigger car and I would want a bigger house and camper to accommodate 
-Our youngest is not potty trained and having to change 2 sets of diapers just stresses me out. 
-The world is built for families of 4
-We would be outnumbered. Which brings up a whole other list of things. 
-The world and economy is shit. (Need I say more?)
- We have no village
I could go on and on and on , but I wont 

My 5 pros which carry no real weight in my mind:
-A bigger family at holidays
-Someone for our youngest to play with
-My friend and I would be pregnant together
-I could have the natural birth I wanted with our 2nd
-I could get my tubes tied after since we will reach our deductible

My (now) ex-boyfriend pressured me into having an abortion, making me feel like I had no choice. The concerns over the extent of his forcefulness &amp; controlling behaviour were also logged at the time by the medical professionals at the abortion clinic. Two days later, he dumped me over text, told me he never wants to have children with me completely cut me off, and within two weeks, he was posting date night pictures with someone new, as I lay in bed still recovering physically &amp; mentally. He has a narcissistic mother that also blocked me on the day of my surgery and never even acknowledged that I was pregnant. Its just them two, his father is not around &amp; has a completely new family. Its like they both erased me and my baby overnight.

The worst part isI regret it. I didnt want to go through with it, but I was made to feel like I had no choice. I would cancel consultations until he noticed I was doing that so he would start driving me there, I couldnt take the preparation pill for hours but the amount of force I had received, it made me feel like I would be in serious danger if I kept my baby. Now, Im left with this overwhelming grief that I dont know how to process. I feel like a part of me is missing, and I dont know if Ill ever forgive myself. Its hard to function normally when the pain is this heavy. Its been 3 weeks now and I havent eaten a full meal since the day before the surgery, Im signed off work due to my mental health, I dont have any friends as he completely isolated me, and I get no more than 3 hours sleep a night. 

What makes this even harder is that just 10 days before I conceived, I was told I was infertile. Because of my PCOS, one of my ovaries no longer works, and I was led to believe that getting pregnant naturally would be nearly impossible for me. So when I found out I was pregnant, it felt like a miraclesomething I never thought Id get the chance to experience. And now, knowing that I was forced into giving that up, without knowing if Ill ever get another chance, makes the grief even more unbearable.

2025-03-16,1742127558.0,Post MA and I feel hopeless,"(Throwaway account! Sorry, english is not my first language, pardon my grammar lapses)

Had a successful MA yesterday. Process only took me 4 hours to pass my precious angel. The procedure didnt go very well and heres the context.

March 14,2025
- I asked my live-in partner if he can take a day off this weekend to help me with my MA. I explained and said sorry in advance if I ever sound demanding as this procedure is mentally and emotionally draining for me. He said yes, assured me that he would be there. I already took mifepristone at 11:30am. 
- Later that afternoon, he asked permission if he can report work to fulfill his duties as it was critical for him to decline (hes an engineer and I cant really understand how does his workload looks like on a daily basis) that he also needs to work on Sunday for rotational work. I also told him that I may not understand his workload, but I understand that he needs to focus at work, but the stress hes giving me is just unnecessary.
- As a response, I lashed out on him, voicing out my frustrations and he took it negatively and broke up with me as I was affecting his career.
- At that time, I was really disappointed that he cant fulfill his words.
- ADDITIONAL CONTEXT: 2024 I was at the hospital cause Im about to give birth to our first born, he left me at the hospital for the same reason.. WORK.. that they are understaffed and no one will shoulder his workload. My doctors and midwife even spoke to him to straighten up his priorities as Im in active labor, that they cant proceed with anything unless theres a guardian that can accommodate them if something happens to me, but ofc, as usual, he was really firm with his decision to prioritize his work over his partner. Im new in town and I barely even have friends to ask help with.

March 15 
- at 11:30am already took the first dose of misoprostol and it all came back to me, the abandonment, the neglect from the day I gave birth, and after childbirth, the paternity leave I gave him was just useless, later on I figure out that he didnt disclosed that I was pregnant to his company. And yes, he left me with child care after birth with minimal help as he told me, as he ALWAYS told me that I need to be self-sufficient. And yesterday, it all crashed down on me. The same reason I had to deal with from the times I asked him for help. So I decided to handle things on my own. I went through the process scared, anxious, paranoid and alone.
- He went to work in the morning and went home around 12pm to offer help but my mind is already dysregulated and already disconnected that I refused to receive any help from him. Then he got angry and started shouting and even throwing things inside our room while im actively going through the abortion. Even threatened to hit me but shouted in front of my face instead.
- I was still firm that Im not gonna accept any help from him, the amount of stress that hes giving me is just not helping. So I was left with my 1 year old, crying, doing tantrums while my body is shaking, painfully going through the process. He didnt even bother with child care so I can focus with my process. Idk, hes trying to help but not really helping, shit made me really confused at this point, but oh well, what can I do? I just continued the process with all the emotions that Im feeling. No one to talk to, just trying to seek comfort while watching tiktok clips. 
- 3pm, I was able to finish the procedure and was crying and breaking down for couple of hours after seeing my angel. 
- The next few hours I started bleeding heavily, passing big clots after and cramping so bad that ibuprofen didnt even help to minimize the pain. Fell asleep but woke up around 3am with severe cramping, passed another big clots until dawn. 
- I woke at 3am and I thought It was already done but he even messaged my only friend whos been there for me but was not pro-abortion, telling her that she should check on me as I was doing the abortion. Now my only friend already FOd me as it was against her ethics to tolerate this. I felt betrayed for what he did and disappointed with everything that I just want to die. My grief was beyond comprehension, I just dont understand anything anymore at this point.

March 16
- Post MA today, Im still somewhat heavily bleeding 1 1/2 pads within 2 hours, but I decided to go to the mall as if nothing happened, hoping I can pass out there and die, I was just nauseous and dizzy but still able to walk and even bought groceries for me and my 1 year old baby. 
- I broke down after eating, almost had a panic attack while lining up to the cashier cause I saw a pregnant woman being held by her husband/partner

I slept with a  situationship who told me he loved me and had feelings for me and got pregnant. I wont say it was completely unplanned as we were drunk, he said do you want my babies, I said yes. 

Fast forward 5 weeks later I find out I am pregnant. I was initially excited but then we had a conversation and  I realised he was really excited to have a child but wasnt sure if he wanted to get to get to know me or try be in a serious relationship.

I asked him why he had previously told me he loved me and he said, that he didnt know why but that we would be alright. 

I know that he has a visa that limits him on the type of companies that will sponsor him, which is something he complains about everytime we speak. I am scared he is going to use our child to get a family visa.

I also have an underlying condition which could cause me to have a difficult pregnancy and having to go through all that by myself, will be difficult. 

I am thinking about having an abortion but I feel bad as I did all this to myself and should have been more careful. Am I selfish for considering an abortion?",abortion,9.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jc2m49/am_i_selfish_for_considering_an_abortion_uk/
2025-03-16,1742091821.0,"rpoc 2 weeks after MA at 10.5 weeks, D+E?","had a medical abortion at 10.5 weeks for a pregnancy i desperately wanted to keep, but i didnt have enough support to guarantee the babys wellbeing. this was a couple months after a breakup with the person i have lived with for the past 2 years and thought i was going to marry. broke my wrist and dropped out of my graduate program during the pregnancy and got a concussion around a week ago. needless to say, this has been some of the hardest few months of my life. 

i have not bled but only been passing tissue since the MA, and i was able to get them to do an ultrasound when i went to the ER for the concussion. they consulted with my OB/GYN and i have 1.3cm thick tissue on my endometrium retained from the pregnancy. i was given the option of waiting to see if it passes with subsequent periods, but im terrified of retained tissue leading to future pregnancy complications. tried misoprostol again for the tissue and absolutely nothing happened, so they scheduled me for D+E later this week. i am so tired and just want to get to the point where i can cope with the grief and depression and work towards having my life back. 

i made the decision to have the procedure because of this, but im also really do not want to have to go through another traumatic medical experience, especially without support. i have read a lot of others stories about waiting for this tissue to pass for months without any luck. is going through with the D+E worth it? should i wait? please feel free to share experiences in either direction, hope everyone is getting by out there d",abortion,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jcbhj1/rpoc_2_weeks_after_ma_at_105_weeks_de/

2025-03-16,1742130864.0,Seating at mass,"Im a family of 4 , with a 2 year old and a 3 month old , we need some real estate when it comes to seats . Having to pack the caravan to get to church is a huge hurdle . Its difficult to even arrive on time at times . Yesterday we arrived 5 minutes before mass started and realized that the church was a full house . We walk in to see no unseated pews . 

I guess my rant, if you will , is every time I go to mass I see the same thing, one person (multiple people do this) in a pew sitting at the end kind of blocking the available seats. This makes it awkward because clearly the solo sitter or couple is doing this so they dont have to share the pew with randoms or want to receive the Eucharist first or need an aisle seat for some reason . To me I dont care I will politely ask for them to move to squeeze in . But if the family with kids comes in during the first reading, they are cooked , feeling awkward and stand in the back or mid mass ask to squeeze in to a row 2/3s up the church .

One might say get there earlier and secure a row . Arriving early allows you to prepare yourself for mass . 10 minutes early is on time.
I say to this - I wish we could . Its not as easy for a mom who pumps , baby who eats every 2-3 hours , a toddler who is a toddler and a dad who lassos everyone in to arrive early . We are lucky to make it on time .  Also kids in a quiet setting have a time limit . I start losing the toddler around the preparation of the Eucharist so I we got there earlier quite possibly we can lose her mid gospel sermon .  No my church does not have a child crying room. 

One might say  maybe divide the family and go to separate masses so you can arrive early and easier to manage the kids  
I say to this . Absolutely not , we are a family, our faith is collective. 




To end my rant , please if you are are solo or a couple and arrive 10-15 minutes early try to move to the inside of the pew to allow the next wave of people to be seated with out having to ask you to move. Or maybe consider sitting with another solo or couple and enjoy worshipping together , this might allow a larger family quietly find seating .I say this all with love and good will . And I never had someone be mad about moving for us , typically greeted with a smile . Just an observation

We went back, the hemorrhage was a bit bigger, wife continued progesterone and bed rest, just this saturday she bled like 2 tissues worth of blood so I rushed her to the ER, the OB said that the hemorrhage was gone and the baby was actually 2-3 days bigger than the estimate and has good heart rate. Everything was normal, closed and long cervix and everything, she had a speculum to check, cervix was normal

Kind of looking for advice and guidance here&

Im almost at my due date and feeling mentally more and more unstable. Not because of the delivery or postpartum, but because of (irrational) fears and anxiety. 
Im feeling over protective already and am creating scenarios in my head that are driving me crazy. As a result Im feeling sad, angry and terrified all the time. For example Im scared that after the delivery the baby will be taken away from me and I wont have that golden hour skin to skin (for whatever reason) or that family or grand parents will come by uninvited and claim the baby as their own. 
Ive been judged when I said that I would like to spend the first day(s) with my husband and the baby alone to bond saying that Im robbing the grand parents from their time with their first grand baby. It already feels that I owe people MY child that I carried. Im scared that when the baby leaves my body that I have to share him (even with my husband) and that I wont even matter anymore, cause I was just the body that was needed to make this human. 
Im angry at my husband all the time and although he says he wont tell anyone once we have the baby or send pics of the baby without my consent, I struggling to believe him because I will be tired and weak and wont be able to control everything. This is so not me..
Im a midwife and nurse myself so I should know that my anxiety is exaggerated. Im scared that this overbearing will drive me in a postpartum psychosis. Any of you who experienced these feelings?",pregnant,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jc79bz/38w_and_lots_of_anxiety/

I'm 9 weeks today. Supposedly. 
I'm freaking out constantly that maybe it's already gone. 
This is my third pregnancy, the first made it to 8 weeks but didn't develop past 7. Ended in a d&amp;c. The second made it to 7 and had a miscarriage on my own but I knew it was coming because my blood work wasn't great. 
This one I found out about on Valentine's. I'm not going to lie the timing couldn't be worse, 2 weeks after my due date is my brother's wedding that my husband is the best man in, I'm in the bridal party, and it's all happening at my parents house 4 hours away. But I still want this so bad. 
My husband is very encouraging and says we will keep trying as long as it takes but I'm 37. 
I have two different doctors, my normal gyno doesn't do babies anymore so she recommended my OB. I haven't seen the OB this pregnancy yet, I'm supposed to have an appointment this Wednesday and an ultrasound Thursday. I'm now freaking out because I went to look at the times and they're not showing up in the app anymore so if they got cancelled I'm going to cry. 
My normal gyno ordered blood work Feb 19 that was great and an ultrasound on Feb 26th that was also right on track. 
But I am not having morning sickness at all, maybe I'm just lucky. My breasts are tender and I'm extra gassy and very emotional and tired. But that's all my symptoms. It's making me so nervous. I keep wanting to like just keep taking pregnancy tests or something. How do you get over not knowing if it's ok or not? 
Like eventually they move and stuff so I imagine that will be reassuring. But if it's still there this is the furthest I've ever been but I just don't know if it's still there. 
I'm so sorry this is just a ramble. My Brain is fried, my therapist is out of town for a few weeks, I'm having a time haha.

If you can share anything, please do. Im sorry its so long, I tried to trim everything down but theres just so much.***

My pregnancy has been more of an emotional rollercoaster than I even thought it could be. Im currently due June 2nd, and Im not sure what all to expect with the last couple months. 

In the first half of my pregnancy, I was diagnosed with HG and was throwing up constantly and unable to keep food or medication down, resulting in me losing around thirty pounds within the first trimester. It was incredibly hard for me and my husband. If I hadnt known I was pregnant I wouldve thought I had cancer or some serious illness. 

We were waiting to tell our families in person, but we live out of state. Just before we went to see them we had our first ultrasound, and got to see the baby for the very first time. It was incredible, and breathtaking. It made it all feel so worth it. I was so glad to see my sickness wasnt effecting him like I was worried it was. 

We finally got to tell our families we were pregnant around week 14, for Thanksgiving. It was absolutely beautiful, and something Ill remember the rest of my life.

Immediately following Thanksgiving, I got incredibly sick, on top of my HG situation. Some sort of respiratory sickness they couldnt put a name on, and couldnt give me medication for at first. For one week, I really thought I was going to die I was so ill. On top of the HG, I couldnt breathe, had severe chest pains that I even went to the ER for because I got so scared, was coughing so hard it made me cry and vomit. It was so painful. I had a mental breakdown, and truly thought the baby might not make it. They ended up finally giving me medication to help at least a little. It took another week to feel like it was getting better.

I was able to get a couple of days at work that week. I had been missing most days of work for two months. I came home on December 12th, and my beloved kitty got her wings that night. It was my first true loss, and it was really hard. 

That next week we found out that we are having a boy, and getting to share the news with family and my husband is something I will cherish forever. It was so wonderful. 

Over Christmas, my HG finally seemed to be letting up. It was amazing. I ate food for the first time in months that wasnt rice or bread. We stayed home instead of seeing family because it had made me so so sick last time, and to spend time with our other pets. It was beautiful, and it even snowed a tiny bit.

Come new years, my HG was back, but my belly was starting to show and we had gotten to see him on ultrasound again. I tried to push through and make it to work. My boss pulled me aside and told me that I whod been missing too much, even with everything going on. That they understood, but if I missed or called out one more day within 8 weeks they would take me to part time and cut my benefits. They acted like I was just staying home because I wanted to and not because I was horribly sick. We were running out of our savings, it wasnt like I didnt need to be there, I couldnt. Adding an entire new stress to my situation. 

We get our 20 week anatomy scan mid January. They were unable to see his face, with his arms up, and needed to get another scan soon to try to check for cleft. They are unable to see his heart fully. They tell me they also saw what may be a tumor is his brain, and will check it again next time. At this point theyve been taking blood and urine samples every time I come in. My white blood cell count is double what it should be and had been that way since I got sick at Thanksgiving. They let me know they are sending me to a specialist but not to worry. I am definitely worried for my little guy.

They schedule me a few more weeks out for another ultrasound. I try to make it to work, as Im in fear of losing my benefits so close to birth. Im throwing up multiple times a day and having to leave my desk constantly. Theyre upset Im not able to grab someone to cover the desk on my way to run to the restroom to vomit. Theyre upset I seem sick, tired, and on the verge of tears at the front desk. Not a good look for them. Exactly why Ive been staying home. 

They got my results back and tell me I might have small kidney stones and to drink a ton of water to try to flush them out. Super easy request seeing as Im still throwing up multiple times a day. 

The specialist is an oncologist. They are watching me to see if I have leukemia. Didnt know that until I literally am sitting in the oncologist office, and shes the one to tell me why Im there. I get they didnt want me to worry. But Im starting to feel like Im falling apart.

Im finally feeling his kicks and movements. Its bringing me a lot of peace, and its so wonderful to feel like hes okay in there. We get our ultrasound and no tumor, no cleft and no heart defect. thank God. We started getting stuff for the nursery and putting things together. The HG is getting lighter. Only a few days a week Im throwing up. I feel like I can truly see the beautiful light at the end of the tunnel.

I developed this cyst in my right breast, that grew from a dime size to about the size of a clementine, and was so incredibly painful. It got red and swollen until it was purple. Again they didnt want to give me antibiotics and there was nothing I could do but put a compress on. I couldnt even wear a bra. I had to keep going to work or they would drop my benefits. Eventually the cyst burst on its own and all this puss came out. It drained for three days. They had to express it further and finally put me on antibiotics. I had that open wound on my breast for about a week, and kept having to rewrap it, to the point the tape was tearing little parts of my skin off. But it did finally heal. 

This past week, Tuesday I wake up with some sort of respiratory situation again. My throat is so sore I cant swallow and have a fever. They still want me to come into work, so I do. 

We woke up Wednesday morning to my beloved dog Sam having some neurological symptoms, and we had to lay her to rest on Wednesday. After thirteen beautiful years. This is the hardest thing Ive ever been through. 

I try to go to work Thursday, but I was so broken I just left. I told my boss I couldnt be here, I couldnt even think. Theyre probably going to fire me. I dont even care anymore. I cant deal with all of this. Im now so incredibly sick, coughing things up, sore throat, drainage etc; if I could, I wouldnt go in to work tomorrow either. 

Please: I need some advice. Any advice. If you been through a rough pregnancy or grieving while going through this, please let me know how you made it. I feel like Im trying my best to keep my head held high but its one thing after another, like waves crashing down on my head and I cant catch my breath. I dont know what to do or how to navigate this. Im trying to stay positive for the baby and take care of us, still show up to work, etc. But I feel so broken right now.",pregnant,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jciufi/emotional_rollercoaster/

2025-03-16,1742112899.0,Rejected by best friend for being pregnant,"My best friend just cant handle the fact that I want to have a baby and live a heteronormative life. So today, 5 days out from my scheduled c section, she texted me that our friendship is essentially over and shes processing the grief so I need to leave her space. To be clear, she very much wants to stay in my life, but not my babys (wtf lol, shes absolutely not invited-ever- to meet my baby) and shes trying to recover from this perceived betrayal Ive taken with my life choices. 

Making this post as I feel very alone. 

**Background:**
Im 37, married, financially and emotionally stable, have so much support from extended family, am employed with very good parental leave (I live in Germany so its 14 months paid)& Im laying this out to explain that having a baby is not a dumb or rash decision, and that isnt her basis for criticism. 

**The issues:**
I am giving birth in 5 days to a very wanted baby and my best friend has been nothing but negative and mean about it from the beginning. 

For example, I told her Im pregnant and she wrote back RIP to your life, I brushed it off as a joke. She asked me why I would do that, ruin my life, give it up for a life of screaming and hell etc etc. 

**she hates my nursery** love interior design and spent a lot of time and money getting the nursery together. I commissioned my friend who is an artist to paint a custom mural on the wall tying in my cultural history and my husbands cultural history. Its fckn cute. When I showed my best friend I was so proud and she commented  about how ugly it is and she hates it but followed up with oh well at least i dont have to spend any time here looking at it. I let it go. I also got a super rare antique Murano glass chandelier for the room and I know its beautiful. She told me its tacky. Since then she brought up 3 times without prompting or being asked how much she hates the baby room. 

**worst case scenario births** When I was about 16 weeks pregnant and vomiting all day she took it upon herself to outline every single worst case scenario that can happen in birth, from permanent fecal incontenance, to having your uterus removed. I told her to stop (this was via text) and she pushed back and told me I was brainwashed by propaganda and if I knew the truth I would never even have a baby& Its her job to educate me. (Was super offensive and disturbing). 

**life ruined** At about 25 weeks she explained how much my career will suffer and how men avoid doing work within the home and women end up doing everything, about male weaponised incompetence etc.  also about mothers judging each other in mother groups and how bitchy it is (I get that but she knows my scandanavian husband and whats hes like- we have such an equal partnership). 

**c section** It came to a head yesterday when I texted her to tell her Im having a c section on Friday. I said c section on Friday, omg Im so excited and scared. She wrote back the next day well this is your last free weekend ever& you should go out and party. I guess thats not a bad response but it just was the last straw. I told her im sensitive at the moment and I need support and Im genuinely being hurt by her constant barbs and negativity. If she cant be at least neutral then I need some space.

She wrote back that she thanks me for telling her my needs and she will tell me her needs tomorrow. Then I got this big list about how she doesnt believe in motherhood and having babies from a political standpoint, she is genuinely disgusted by babies, she is **grieving the loss of my friendship** (totally news to me since I didnt know we werent friends anymore!). 

Anyways Im just down about it all. Making this post to see if anyone has any words about similar experiences or how to handle the situation. Shes been a big part of my life and strong support and great friend so Im honestly hurt.

And its also sad that shes given me so much negativity about babies and birth that it has overshadowed my excitement for the birth. I mean, I just wrote her one message and end up in this huge discussion about how hard this is for her, and feeling like I need to apologise to her for having a baby .
Is she trying to be mean ? I dont get it 

Edit: shes self diagnosed autistic on the spectrum which is why I have given her so much Lee-way. Im asking myself at what point is it ok to stop being understanding and letting it go ",pregnant,130.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jcgsyf/rejected_by_best_friend_for_being_pregnant/

2025-03-16,1742136501.0,How do I tell my boyfriend I want our daughter to have my last name?,"A little bit of context - I (26F) am 8 months pregnant with my (32M) boyfriends daughter. 

We unexpectedly got pregnant and found out in August of last year. Once we found out, my entire world changed. I obviously stopped drinking, vaping, caffeine, everything to ensure I had a healthy, safe pregnancy (which thankfully I have). My boyfriend struggled with the change. For months, I found him sneaking alcohol behind my back, hiding drinking from me, and being completely irresponsible. We had the talk many times before that if this happened abortion was not an option (for me, I am 100% pro choice though). Here is why: 

I have worked very hard to become financially stable and independent. I purchased my first home at 24 which we live in together (everything is in my name). I have a full time job that I have been at for 3 years with great benefits (including the health insurance that has gotten us 100% through this pregnancy). I work from home and have the ability to keep my daughter home with me once she is born, and 3 months of paid maternity leave. I put money in savings every month and only have a car payment/mortgage. So in my mind, and what we agreed to before, was if I got pregnant we would keep the baby. 

Over the last 8 months, our relationship has really struggled. He has not been supportive or helped me in any way. I have purchased everything for the baby (almost $4,000 worth), paid for our maternity photos, scheduled all the doctors appointments, cooked my own meals, did the nursery alone. All while he was drinking (which he finally says he stopped, I dont have the energy to care anymore), and smoking weed every single day (he still does this). 

I have cried to him many times about the emotional state of our relationship and how I need him at this time but nothing has changed. There is no intimacy in our relationship, and he only cares about himself and the image of having a girlfriend/baby on the way. He owns his own business and does not have health insurance so he contributes nothing (and has NO plan to) for our daughters health. It will all fall on me. 

Im writing to ask, how do I tell him I want her to have my last name? I am terrified our relationship wont last this way, Ive asked about counseling but of course I would have to pay for it. He gets offended when I ask. But I am doing everything for our child. He just feels we are lucky that we wont have to pay for childcare and that Ill breastfeed to save money on formula. But those are still sacrifices I am making, because I will be a full time employee (and bread winner) who is also taking care of our child. 

If our relationship does turn around and we decide to get married one day, it would be much easier to change her last name than to ever get his permission to change it
From his to mine. Ive really struggled and its taking a horrible toll on my mental health. Anything helps, thank you. ",pregnant,79.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jcn334/how_do_i_tell_my_boyfriend_i_want_our_daughter_to/

Like, if I upset her in any way, she says ""well I just won't throw your baby shower then."" It's a control thing. This leads to her procrastinating, not getting things done in time, dropping the ball, or just not doing things at all. It's a lifelong pattern.

That being said, I was given advice about this situation in the AITAH subreddit to have someone else help her along or watch her. Hold her accountable essentially. My mother in law is an absolute angel. She and I are very alike, meaning she has been on top of everything. She volunteered to do the whole thing and was very happy to join with my sister when I suggested it. My sister seemed happy with it too. Until my sister just didn't do anything for it.

Fast forward a little bit, at 20 weeks pregnant my MIL said she didn't hear from my sister so she booked the venue and did all the phone calls to actually find a place. My sister did not help.

At 21 weeks pregnant, MIL and I are finding addresses and making spreadsheets to make RSVPs easier. My sister didn't add a single address.

At 21+3 weeks pregnant, my MIL sent my sister and I a message updating about addresses, and she specifically mentioned my sister's name and asked her if she wanted to do the invitations. I didn't hear back from my sister in days and, unsure of she reached out to MIL directly, I texted her myself asking if she said anything. She said she didn't because she's been so busy. Her never-ending excuse for everything she doesn't feel like doing. I said fine whatever. I texted MIL to let her know (kindly) about my sister procrastinating and to let me know if she doesn't hear back.

At 22 weeks pregnant, we see MIL in person, and she is excitedly showing DH and I shower invites she created! They're beautiful and so cute, and she took so much stress off of me in that moment. But fearing my narcissistic sister, I asked if MIL ever heard back from my sister. She said she did not. Of course!! Ugh.

Fast forward to last night 22+2, I talked to my sister to let her know that MIL was planning on moving full speed ahead of she didn't hear back. My sister attempted to give me every excuse in the book, and started saying ""well why didn't she follow up with me then??"" She completely ignored the fact that she did in fact receive MIL's message, AND mine following up. I told her she needs to communicate and that's why MIL is moving forward, because it needs to be done. The shower is still 3 months away but MIL wants to order invites and have family from out of state come, so about 2 months beforehand they will go out. My sister said she was planning on ordering the invitations at the end of April when she finally would have time. I said that is over a month from now! She became very aggressive toward me and said ""Your mother in law just wanted to help and now she's doing the whole thing!""

What she doesn't know is that I've learned to hold my ground.

I told her yes, my MIL is doing the whole thing right now, because you cannot communicate with anyone, you procrastinate, and this has to be done. You can do games or themes or decorations when you ""have time"" later, but I am not doing this with you. There is a baby on the way and he will come on the due date, not when you ""have time."" The shower will be done on the date it is scheduled. Not when you ""have time.""

My husband is aware and is very supportive. I reached out to my MIL to let her know that I spoke with my sister about everything (again leaving out details of arguments and feelings). I told her if she doesn't hear back from my sister before the end of the weekend to move forward with the invitation order.

I'm done sparing feelings for my sister because she doesn't seem to prioritize mine in any way. She hasn't lifted a finger for this shower and lets things go too far before she even starts. Not to mention she is completely broke and can't afford anything. My MIL is an absolute hero and I love her. It just sucks that my sister can't get her shit together long enough to even plan a party. A very important one to shower her first nephew to be.

Thanks for listening. This has been an utter nightmare but I feel a lot better not sparing feelings for someone who doesn't give a crap about mine. I am happy to grow a backbone and stand up for myself and my husband and my baby, and I am thankful to have my amazing MIL on my side.",pregnant,12.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jcjcep/my_sister_wants_to_plan_the_baby_shower_but_is/
2025-03-16,1742093328.0,Hospitalization,"Yesterday and today have been a long day, but yesterday I had made plans to unalive myself. I have been suffering with depression + suicidal ideation for years now, I was on medication that helped me for 9 months before I found out I was pregnant. My prenatal care provider had advised me there isnt enough research on the medication I was on during pregnancy, so she had told me the risks and I had opted out of taking it. Mostly because I had took it once and started bleeding for a few days and we were never able to find out what was the cause of the bleeding but it scared me enough out of taking it.

Dont get me wrong I love my baby, and I choose to keep my baby for that reason. I am about to be 20 weeks tomorrow, Ive been struggling with family issues, losing a friend and problems with my childs father since the beginning of my pregnancy. I slowly felt myself getting pushed to the edge (although I did reach out to my doctor for help and we were trying to make a plan to help me mentally during the pregnancy and put me back in therapy) yesterday somethings happened within my family and I did start to plan to unalive myself. 

I noticed me falling into my suicidal ideation and I took myself to get help at the ER, since my doctor has told me go get help when I need it. I told a few of my friends what happened and Im getting a few your being selfish , you have a baby who is depending on you now but I been asking for help for months from these people. Especially my childs father and people didnt take my cries for help serious, until now. 

Im glad I noticed the red flags and went to go get help so I didnt hurt me or baby but right now I just feel like shit, the pressure just got to me.

Update: I am currently in the psych ward department in the ER, I have been since Friday night. I started on Zoloft yesterday 50 mg, and Im feeling okay just nausea. The plan is to put me in a in patient psych ward and I dont know how I feel about that, but I guess its what they believe is best for me and baby.

That kind of changed the entire course of things and now hes only due to be back a month or two post the babys birth.

My and my husbands families will both get the registry because, of course, they are all invited to the baby shower. I love my in-laws, but many among them have a so you think youre better than me? attitude when it comes to money. While my family certainly isnt wealthy, his family is mostly from very modest means in rural US.

My husband and I both have great careers and few expenses, so we are going a little upscale on some of our items. (Nothing crazy, but no fear of the $800 stroller or $200 diaper bag if thats whatll make our life easier). We also have some non-necessaries, like the ceres chill and baby brezza.

That whole time, I was just anxious and my every thought was ""don't be excited because you could lose it"" sure enough, I did. But man I wish I had just let myself experience the joy of finding out I was pregnant. It was already sad to lose the baby, but to think about that whole experience and see I was just negative the whole time. It's heartbreaking to see myself that way. I have always wanted to be a mother, and I thought I was guarding my heart. But I was denying myself the joy of motherhood, even if it was just for a week. 

This time, I'm about 5 weeks, and I wake up and choose to be excited and LOVE this baby for however long I get to have it. I get to be a MOM! And yes, I know I'm early. I know that stats show I have a 20% of losing this. But I'm hanging on to that 80% that I won't. I am choosing to embrace this season, love deeply, feel connectedness to my womb. And I will tell the people I know who will celebrate this with me, and ignore any judgment. I bought gender neutral onsies a couple of days ago because I wanted to and I'm GLAD I did! This baby is so loved, and I am optimistic I will meet them someday. But if I don't, then I'll know that I allowed myself to experience this pregnancy authentically me. I will mourn my loss, I will be heartbroken, but I'll know the motherly love I have was given the space it needed during this time.

I just needed to rant. I feel like I see so many ""I hate to be a Debbie downer BUT..."" comments on many early excited pregnancy posts, and I just wanted to be the positive voice. We are all scared, we are all anxious, and we all know the odds!!! We know the worst case scenario! But I refuse to let that energy into this pregnancy.

When she asked the name and I told her, she had a visceral reaction to it and was not shy about saying she didn't like it. Lol. 

When she asked to see the ultrasound, she got creeped out by it and said it looks disgusting. Lmao.

The list goes on but I digress. 

The way I've been dealing is to act shocked and say wowww, you're the ONLY person who's said that to me. Then I start telling them about how everyone else in my life is so supportive, loves the name, gushes over the ultrasound. She didn't know how to react =

I think the trick is even though it stings, act as positive as possible and show them that it doesn't affect you. Make THEM out like THEY are the weird ones for being all negative Nancy. Honestly it works a charm. 

Someone says baby doesn't look like you even though baby is a spitting image of you? ""Wowww! That's so interesting you say that, you know, you're the only one who has said that. Everyone else says she looks just like me!"" :)

Getting dressed is so difficult. Im simultaneously excited to see my baby grow but feel embarrassed to be visibly pregnant. 

My parents came into town to visit today. I dont have the best relationship with my mom, its been strained since childhood. (Shes narcissistic and a little emotionally immature). Ive been in therapy for years to heal from abuse and work on maintaining healthy boundaries with my family.

Visit was going good until she reached out to touch my stomach at lunch. I reflexively jumped in my seat and loudly said NO. She looked genuinely confused, THEN asked if she could feel baby. I again said no. I felt like I was going to crawl out of my skin and felt a primal sense of protection? I felt rage.

She then said well I can when you get bigger and baby is kicking. I again said no, I do not want to be touched I dont like being touched. She again repeated that she could.

They have been closely monitoring me since week 20 and i was told early intervention will be needed if necessary, it took me awhile to process this but i was mentally prepared. Our goal was to reach 37 /36 week but not to go beyond that because anything more than that will cause distress to the baby. So yesterday my OB wanted me to get admitted because she didnt want to take any chances also because of my Bp 130/100 and will closely monitor me for IUGR for coming weeks. My Bp looks normal this morning which is funny  and baby is actively moving so I feel stupid now for rushing to the hospital. I was also given steroid shot. I know being around the nurses is the safest for my baby but I really want to make it at least to 36 weeks. My OB told me the baby will come anytime if there is severe growth restriction i know she wants the best for me and the baby but I want to cook it for longer, in 2 days time I will be 34 weeks. So i just need 2 weeks more at least but i am shit scared for nicu if the baby comes early. I wonder if they will ever discharge me or wont let me out until I delivery this baby. 
Sometimes I feel like i am wasting everyones time here since everything looks good as for now. Bp stabilized, heart beat normal and she is moving and I blame my anxiety for agreeing to be admitted, maybe I couldve just waiting for one more week. 
And now I  ranting here thinking whether i did a right thing panicking for no reason. I know its too late now as I am already admitted but just wanted some reassurance here whether i did the right thing.

I would describe my husband as a pretty stoic, rational man. He doesnt really give in to negative emotions, generally is able to stay on the positive side of things. He is pretty indifferent to small daily stressors, not overwhelmed easily. Pretty even keel. 

Well he dropped a bomb on me the other day that he is really struggling with not feeling important or a priority during the pregnancy. That his feelings are responsible for him not showing me affection and being distant lately. His justification for these feelings are based off a casual conversation we had a month ago where he said he felt like he was on the back burner to which I agreed. I said it sucks but yeah you kind of are, Im the one thats pregnant. The focus needs to be on me and the baby. 

Apparently he had been feeling badly for some time before he brought it up a month ago and said that the conversation just confirmed what he was feeling so he just decided to harbor negative feelings and allow them to change the way he interacted with me. But he let me leave that conversation feeling like things were resolved and led me to believe we were in a good place. 

I feel pretty blindsided. Hes done this before, concealed feelings and let them negatively impact our relationship and then it all kinda blows up. Im due in less than 3 weeks, why did he have to do this now??? 

Anyway idk Im questioning everything. Im feeling like my sacrifices have been all for naught and Ive not been appreciated or acknowledged for anything Ive done. Youd think I was abusive or something toward him or putting all the responsibility on him. I havent been. Ive still been working, taking care of the household, shopping, etc. even though its been such a struggle. I try not to even ask him for things because I feel like a burden. 

Im in so much pain lately and trying to mentally and physically prep for birth and Im getting hit with this crap right now. I mean what was I supposed to do, coddle him this entire time? I just dont really understand it. Im just so tired and dont know where to go from here. I dont even feel like talking to him about it or fighting about it. 

Ironically enough, I had just written him a heartfelt letter and put together a box of all his favorite snacks to give him before the baby is here..

So normally im not one to complain but this is my first baby and ive waited and rescheduled this anatomy scan so many times so my experience really upset me. Also no im not homophobic maybe im wrong but a lot of the stuff im about to right that was said just kind of annoyed me.


So to start it off the appointment was 20 minutes late and my mum had driven hours to come and see the baby and this ultrasound is supposed to be the last one to see the baby before birth and we paid $270. My partner and i were super excited as i had been in hospital a few days prior for reduced movement so just wanted to see our girl. We got into the appointment and the man doing our scan was super entitled, rude to my mum, myself and partner. he breaks part of the equipment before we even start and i just brush it off, he then put the tv screen on where we can see the baby and it doesnt turn on properly, we asked if maybe someone could check it out and he said that this scan wasnt for our entertainment and theres a reason he didnt go into IT, at this point i kind of just wanted to cry. He kept on pressing way to hard and would pull my pants down without even asking me (yes i know sometime they need to go low but its nice to have a little warning instead of someone ripping your pants down). He then asked if we new the gender and i said yes its a girl we are super excited and was talking about her little outfits and he said i prefer not to gender them and colour isnt really a gender thing anyways. At this point i kind of gathered his opinions and views and it really annoyed me how he treated us. i understand everyone is allowed their views but it felt wrong that he kept on shutting down my own opinions and excitement on my own daughter. Finally he tried to take a few of her measurements and couldnt get them, he took the measurements which put her way behind her date instead of rescheduling and kept calling her annoying because she wouldnt move or would suck on her hand or something shed do. i barely got to see her cause the screen was broken. Anyways needed to vent or ill cry, i have an appointment with my OB tuesday and GP wednesday. Am i wrong for wanting another scan and being upset?

I have a friend whos pregnant right now too and her whole pregnancy she follows no restrictions at all and I dont judge her for that.

My baby is 10 months old and I just found out I'm pregnant again (this was wanted and we're so excited). 

My boy is a massive 99th percentile and has always loved food whether it's boob or solids. Even before I got pregnant, the daily feeds were starting to get hard. He's got 8 teeth and he would suck a little then just bite me - never seemed interested in actually having a decent feed. I would always offer before then giving him solids. The first feed when he wakes up for the day has remained really good. 

I've been pumping heaps to try and maintain supply in case he wants to come back to it more during the day but if I'm honest, it's starting to feel pointless. 

Now I'm pregnant again. I'm tired. I have stuff I want to accomplish before baby number 2 and wasting the time to pump when I'm barely getting anything anymore just feels... pointless? 

He likes formula and I know there's nothing wrong with it but I always had it in my mind he wouldn't need formula and I would feed him until at least a year but idk how achievable that goal is now. 

Being pregnant again I'm just so freaking tired and part of me feels like I should give my body a break. I will keep up with the morning feeds as long as he lets me cos another huge part is not ready for this journey to end with him. :(

I'm currently 10w3d and experienced severe nausea and vomiting since about 5 weeks (6 weeks on the dot with the vomiting). I was given Reglan that improved it for a couple days before doing nothing at all besides give me shakiness in my muscles, so I stopped. I got to the point of throwing up about 3-5 times a day and always after a solid meal, went to the ER at 8 weeks because severe dehydration was causing my back and ab muscles to cramp so bad I legitimately thought I had an ectopic (I was also spotting a bit prior), they confirmed baby was progressing as expected with a strong heartbeat and textbook structure/size. They gave me a few days worth of Zofran but my doctor refused to refill because he hadn't seen me yet. Regardless, Zofran was effective for only most of those days but did not stop the puking altogether and the last day I had it, it felt like it did nothing. The nausea was getting worse so out of pure desperation I took the Reglan again and dealt with the unwanted symptoms.

I want to say my nausea peaked (so far) last Wednesday night, I threw up/dry heaved 9 times that day, had an absolute delirious mental episode and considered going to the ER before I eventually just passed out on my bed. Thursday hitting the 10 week mark, I felt *slightly* better but still puking. Friday, puked 3 times. Yesterday once, all acid though, but more bone tired than usual like it was a trade off- first time having solid food since Wednesday.  I never stopped actually being nauseous all day even throughout this. 

This morning my nausea resembled more hunger pains than an actual urge to puke. I feel far more lucid. I don't want to jinx myself, I've been fooled before, but I am at the moment feeling 80% more ""normal."" I've been warned about sudden ends to symptoms as something potentially bad, especially since I read that most people reach their peak nausea symptoms around 10 weeks *if* it's a first trimester thing only, and lasting until 12-14 weeks. 

I guess I'm just looking for a peace of mind. I'm not even sure if I should really call my current symptoms progression as a gradual improvement since the nausea never wavered until literally just this morning. I'm holding on the hope that my boobs are still sore and I'm still sluggish that maybe this is actually a good sign and not something to be concerned about.

2025-03-16,1742127540.0,Worried about my partners mental health (CW loss),"
Im currently 11 weeks pregnant, this is our third pregnancy after a MMC at 13 weeks and a chemical last year. We are now reaching the timeframe we lost our first baby (it passed away at 11.5 weeks). Last week we were told the baby has an enlarged NT which can mean an increased chance of chromosomal abnormalities, were currently (very) anxiously waiting for our NIPT results.

My partner is South African, anyone who knows Afrikaans men will tell you theyre often very traditional and keep to the more classic macho traits. My partner doesnt talk about his feelings - unless hes had a good amount to drink. 

I know my partner struggles with the fact that I obviously feel everything and am so heavily impacted by this pregnancy, he feels kind of on the sideline just waiting to be told how things are going. When I try and talk to him about the pregnancy his response is pretty much always Im sure itll be fine this time. 

On top of that, he doesnt seem that happy with his own stuff. Hes been very demotivated at work for a while. Hes normally very active and also a bit of a thrill seeker, and enjoys a lot of riskier sports. Since our first pregnancy, he quit the riskier stuff, but also hasnt really been enjoying the gym either. He also reads a lot of very negative content online lately and expresses his anger at the state of the world. We currently live in quite a rough area of town, we are moving to the countryside this summer but I know living in this area is also not helping. 

Anyway, over the past few weeks Ive noticed his drinking increase quite a lot. We spoke about it last night and he said he was aware of it, but that he was just so f*cking bored with life at the moment. Obviously with house and baby I was sad to hear this because, although right now life is a little monotonous, we have so much to look forward to. He insisted his feelings were nothing to do with me or our relationship, just the monotony of daily life right now. 

I dont know what to do. He said its not my problem to fix, that he needs to sort himself out. But I cant help but feel really sad about this, on top of the continued pregnancy anxiety, Im really worried about his headspace. Maybe this is how his anxiety comes out, since he doesnt show much emotion in any other capacity. Hes just not the type of person to go speak to someone, so Im not sure how else he can get help.

He's wants me to rest, not overdo it too much but I'm genuinely getting anxious about the house. 

Clothing is piling up, I mean to fold and put it away but keep either falling asleep or just generally can't be bothered most of the time. I get the dishwasher ran as much as possible too, but I have 3 dogs and have been having a hard time keeping up with everything. I cleaned the bathroom out really well yesterday when I had a little energy but ended up having a back spasm from the bending over and felt exhausted the rest of the day. 

It makes me just feel lazy most of them time, mostly because i have been... The nursery is completely done, glad I got it done earlier in the pregnancy but it feels like the rest of the house is in disarray and it's making me so anxious. This is my first child so I don't know what to expect and fear I won't have the time or energy when baby comes to be able to handle it either. It's just kinda bumming me out i guess.

Yesterday I had a positive pregnancy test so thought I would join this subreddit again. I have 2 boys who are 6 and 3 so this will be my third baby.

Im roughly just over 4 weeks pregnant. I thought I was as my period was 4 days late but I had been testing with some cheap test strips from the day I was due on and they all came back negative. I then did a more expensive test &amp; digital test as I felt pregnant and its unusual for my period to be 4 days late and they both came back positive. 

Excited to be joining this community again even though it all seems a bit surreal at the moment and also slightly worried about life with 3 children as my boys are very active and I feel some days are already pretty chaotic!! Me and my husband are pretty go with the flow people so hopefully we wont feel too overstretched!!

My husband and I always been on the same page for the names but recently thats come into question. We originally agreed on Thomas Ike and Margaret (Maggie) May. There wasnt an inspiration behind either we just liked the names. 

So what changed? In January my grandfather died and while it was something we were expecting, it really rocked me. It made me think about how present he was in my life and how missed he is. Ive cried nearly every week since his death and it still hits me at random times and places. It really is such a strange thing to be grieving life while growing new life inside you. 

Due to this impact, I recently started thinking about changing our boy name to Thomas Lawrence Lawrence was my grandfathers middle name. I spoke to my husband about this thought and he said ultimately he would be on board if thats the route I want to move in but he feels like the recent grief is heavy on my heart and thats whats inspiring the name change. He is correct. But since the convo I really have no idea anymore. Ive sat on the question independently for about a month and still cant make up my mind. 

Im also worried because since Ive started telling people the names we have, that Ike is an atypical name. It normally makes people stop and question if we said Mike or just flat out misheard me. It makes me worry if we have a boy and I go with the original name that Im setting him up for a life of having to correct people.  

Should we change our boy name to Thomas Lawrence or keep the name as Thomas Ike?

I was told to come into triage, knowing that the contractions arent consistent. I have been having inconsistent contractions for about a week. They have been getting stronger but not consistent. I know they arent Braxton Hicks, because my Braxton Hicks were much different. I go in and they observe me for a bit and they tell me that they think they are just going to discharge me. They believe that this is early labor, but to go home and rest. They let me know its about shift change so a different resident will probably be discharging me. I say ok and wait for a while. This new resident comes in and says that Im getting a cervical exam. I havent gotten one yet, so I have no clue what its like. He explained that he finds it necessary if Im having contractions. He does the exam and says I am 4cm dilated. The nurse goes, no she cant be, she would be a lot more uncomfortable if so. She says that shed like to check. She does and she says Im about 1cm or possibly 2cm. He says he doesnt agree and asks to do another. He does and says that Im 1cm. He says that he must have put his hand on the wrong tissue. He leaves and the nurse asked whos hurt worse, and I told her, the residents did. Mind you I have a higher pain tolerance, and I wanted to cry. She explained that she thinks I would be in more discomfort if I was further along and she believes Im about 30% effaced and 1.5 cm dilated. She says that she believes that he did it wrong. She explained that she didnt have to go far to check and that baby is very far down. She then says shes going to give me the group b strep test. She leaves and comes back in and says they are going to see if Ive progressed at all in 2 hours, but she wont be there. She says that they saw pink discharge after so I should be aware of light spotting but thats all. I wait and get the second cervical check by the same male resident. It hurts almost more. He says that I have no change and that Im 1 cm and that Im going to be discharged and that its just round ligament pain. The other nurse there says that it could be early labor and to not worry and come back if its worse. At this point Im so uncomfortable. I am having horrible spotting and pain. I still 2 days later am having small spotting along with horrible pain and discomfort. Some sharp and some more cramping. I am still having inconsistent contractions. Was 4 cervical exams really necessary? Are they supposed to be this awful? I go to look on my chart and it says that I was reported 0cm dilated and 30% effaced and -3 station. I at this point am so confused. Why would that put that on my chart if that wasnt the case.

Im not too sure what to do here. Im at 20 weeks, so far everything has been great during this pregnancy, but it seems the last two weeks my health is going haywire. The baby is perfectly fine, which Im super happy about. 

Recently got diagnosed with GD at 18 weeks. My blood pressure recently has been elevated, 152/90 as of 3/14. Ive never had high blood pressure before. Last appointment (last week) was 140/60. And my heart rate wont rest below 113. My thyroid levels are also way off (had It removed a couple years ago due to cancer), which they think might be throwing off my heart rate. 

Ive been doing so good with the GD and diet and all that, but now the BP is another obstacle I need to figure out. I did the urine test early on and passed it so preeclampsia wasnt a worry. Theyre having me do it again to see if preeclampsia is now a factor. I dont have any hand or foot swelling and no headaches. 

Has anyone had to deal with GD and HBP during pregnancy? Was there anything you were able to do to help with the HBP? Im going to attempt to cut out a looooot of salt from my diet to see if that helps at all. Ive also only been drinking water since week 16 when I failed the one hour glucose test in case it became a concern later on.

EDIT: Anywhere I said Advil, Im not taking advil, its off brand Acetaminophen, I got my name brand drugs mixed up,

FTM (22) here, first knowledge of the pregnancy was an at home test, and we are super excited! Id been trying to find an ob/gyn to get scheduled into, but everyone's booked out till April. Cons of being in a town with no other hospitals for 3+ hours.

For a few weeks, id been having terrible right side cramping, enough to bring me to tears in the middle of the night, and overall soreness in my abdomen. After about two weeks, my husband finally forced me to go to the ER to make sure it wasn't ectopic, my appendix, or some other thing. After an ultra sound, the tech looking confused, and two much more in depth ones, they determined I have two endometrial horns? The doc wasn't too entirely sure, but she said that I have a yolk sack w/ no fetal pole in my right horn, and ""small nonspecific fluid or hemorrhage within the left endometrial horn"", along with my right ovary being 2.6x1.9x2.6, and my left one being 4.1x2.1x3.2.

The docs seemed a little concerned, and gave my pregnancy a 50% viability, and wanted me to come back for a repeat quantitative HCG in 48-72 hours, and wanted another ultrasound in 1 week. I was also put on strict pelvic precautions, with no heavy lifting. They referred me to an OB/GYN in branch and sent me on my way.

We came back 3 days later to do the repeat test, and they didn't put in a lab, no one there knew anything about it, they said that was something for my OB to schedule. The only scheduling I can get anywhere close to the ob is with a nurse practitioner New Patient appointment in two weeks. They'll only check my vitals and get me into the system as a patient, a 15 min appointment. I wont even be able to see a doctor. The one they referred me to was on maternity leave, and the only doctor with any slots open was available for mid April, but I cant be scheduled for that at all until my new patient. I cant get in for an ultrasound unless I go back to the ER and check myself in again, or I wait till April to get myself seen by an ob and assessed.

I'm still in a lot of pain, its been about a week calling all over town and even to other towns, and no one can seem to squeeze me in. I cant really sit comfortably, and I don't know if this is normal cramping and I'm being dramatic or what, but work isn't helping me out either. The ER nurse wrote my precautions on my discharge papers, and gave me a note for work, but they ""don't take doctors notes"" and are trying to argue that pushing and pulling carts is ""not lifting because its PUSHING, duh"". I feel like I'm about to pass out on my shifts, but I don't want to go back to the ER just to be told the exact same thing.

Is first trimester usually this rough? I know the vomiting and the tiredness are normal, I can hardly keep anything down and I sleep for 20 hours a day on my days off, but I just cant shake the feeling that somethings fundamentally wrong. I'm taking Advil, but I'm afraid of taking too much, I've always been an anti drugs (for me) kinda person, and its always been ibuprofen that's worked better for me anyways. Independent practices are just as booked up, and I cant de-stress when I'm hurting this much and worried about the baby being okay. Am I doing something wrong, am I missing something?

my husband and i had been trying for about 7 months. we had a blissfully happy first year of marriage before deciding to try. and everything about our story felt perfect. we had been in mexico days before my birthday having the holiday of our lives (pregnant all along!) and then finding out on my birthday was the most amazing gift. i am obviously beside myself. but i dont want this to be my story. i am generally a positive and resilient person. i struggle with depression so i have to be. i cant let myself back slide or sink. i want to be strong for myself, for my husband (who is just as affected by this loss as i am, i believe that) and my step son. who i have worked so hard with to have a beautiful, loving relationship. 

i need help. i woke up this morning wanting to feel happy it happened instead of sad its over. i feel robbed of the beautiful story, the first baby, the milestones and moments i was looking forward to. i dont know what else to say, im just looking for some sympathy and words of wisdom and encouragement to take on this day with my family feeling joy, gratitude, and hope. =",pregnant,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jcga4o/reframing_my_loss/

 I'm both extremely excited about this baby and incredibly nervous. Me and my fiancé always thought it would be at least two years until this happens, as we've been using condoms combined with FAM for contraception for ages. To add to that, exactly around the time I was ovulating I was sick with the flu and by the time I felt better and up for fooling around it had been 24 hours since I ovulated so we thought we were safe. So it's an unexpected pregnancy, but we're not mad about it.
We're anxious as we're just finishing up university this summer. He's been working part time for a year already and he's going to go full time as soon as we're done with our thesis, but we're worried about money a little bit. We do have a place to live where we don't pay rent so that's sorted.
We're also scared about our families' reactions as we really don't know how they'll take the news when we decide to share.

Hey yall&.let me start off with this. I know a lot of pregnancies dont have bad things happen during them. 

I (22 F), and my fiancé (23 M), have been talking about children and how many we want and how we want to raise them since forever. Weve been together since I was 18. 

But, Ive started thinking.  What if my pregnancy doesnt go as planned? Theres sooooo many things that could go wrong bc of&well everything. Im terrified of the idea of getting pregnant. Im scared. I want a baby with my spouse so badly though within the next year or two. But Im terrified. What if I fail my baby? What if I miscarry. What if baby grows incorrectly or they are born with a disability (Id still love them dw). What if they grow outside of the womb? What if&&the list goes on and on and on. 


And Ive thought about it all. I miscarried (BD killed it) at 16. Ive talked to my OGBYN and asked if she thought I was infertile because of this. She said she doubts it. Also. My fiancé made a joke the other day. That he would freaking leave me if I was infertile. Now Im even more scared. 


How would he handle it if I gave birth to an unhealthy baby. Or if I have issues with miscarrying babies? My grandmother miscarried a baby boy before my mom was born. Im so scared. I just dont know. Id be devastated if I just couldnt&have children. Also the world we are in today scares me just as much. I was talking with finance about it. Especially about a baby girl. I had a really hard childhood. I had an alcoholic abusive father. I was SA multiple times by multiple men. I was almost trafficked. I have been attacked, I went through substance abuse. I got in a bad crowd. Stuffed with mental health and still do. 

Am I overthinking all of this? Like I feel like I have every reason to fear the future. But also. The joy a child would bring to my life would be immense. Ive always dreamed of having a big family and being a mother. But&..what if it doesnt go as planned? I just dont know. I know that yall may laugh at this. But its a genuine fear.

I was overweight before I got pregnant. Now I'm 30lbs heavier and I don't wanna type out just how big I am cause of how ashamed I am. 
I have genuinely not changed my calorie intake from pre-pregnancy and I think that's what's so frustrating to me. I eat the same portions, and haven't had intense cravings or anything along those lines. But I'm still gaining weight. 

The big problem is up until 3 weeks ago, my blood pressure was normal! No issues whatsoever. I monitor it at home and at the doc appts of course. Now, at 30 weeks pregnant it is high and stressing me out. 140s/80s. 

On top of that I have failed both 1 hr glucose tests I was given by 10mg and even though I already passed my first 3 hr glucose test, I have to go in for a 2nd one tomorrow. I'm terrified of failing it. 

The rational part of me knows that this is related to the pregnancy but I keep hearing stories of women who started getting high blood pressure during pregnancy and it never went away and now they've been on meds for 10+ years. 

But I'm scared of what gestational diabetes AND high blood pressure may result in for me and my baby in these final weeks. 

I'm soooo tired all the time and can barely walk without being winded.  Where as before I was actually pretty active for a plus size girl.

2025-03-15,1742070086.0,"Do Women Have a Moral Duty to Keep Their Bodies ""Ready"" for Reproduction at All Times?","Late last year, Dr. Rebecca Gomperts (Aid Access, Women on Waves) announced results of a large clinical trial in Moldova, testing the use of a weekly low dose of mifepristone (50 mg) as a contraceptive. The results were promising, with only one pregnancy occurring within 2000 cycles. Furthermore, negative side effects were minimal, with only 4% of the participants experiencing any negative side effects (compared to a 40% negative side effect rate for conventional hormonal contraceptives). Additionally, the low-dose mifepristone was easier to use, requiring only one dose a week, and being more ""forgiving"" of variations in the time the pill is taken. And 89% of the study participants reported that they stopped menstruating while taking mifepristone as a contraceptive. (Probably most women would consider this a positive side effect.)

Because of the positive results, the trials have been expanded to the Netherlands this year. If the results continue to be positive, the plan is to apply to the European Medicines Agency for registration and market authorization to allow this weekly, low-dose mifepristone regimen as a contraceptive throughout the EU.

The method of action for mifepristone as birth control is two-fold: it reduces the rate of ovulation and it thins the endometrial lining of the uterus, making it impossible for a fertilized egg to implant.

([Source](https://msmagazine.com/2025/01/07/mifepristone-weekly-contraceptive-clinical-trials-abortion-pill-birth-control/).)

My primary question for PL supporters is this: 

* Would you have any moral or legal objections to women's use of such a contraceptive? If so, on what grounds?

Here are some secondary questions if you believe that the use of this contraceptive would be immoral:

* If a woman was taking mifepristone as described here *as a contraceptive* and informed her partner that she was doing this before they had sex, and if her partner, knowing this, decided to go ahead and have PIV sex with her, and if one of his sperm fertilized an egg but it failed to implant, whose would be the primary responsibility for the ""death"" of the fertilized egg? (Realistically, neither of them would ever know if this happened, so this is a hypothetical question.)
* *Men's* use of tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, red meat, and food high in trans fats during the months before their partners' conception is associated with higher miscarriage rates, because of these substances' impacts on sperm. ([Source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/a-mans-unhealthy-lifestyle-too-can-lead-to-his-partners-pregnancy-loss/articleshow/64072130.cms?from=mdr).)  If men engage in such unhealthy lifestyles, they are not maintaining their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction, and their choices could result in the ""death"" of a fertilized egg or even an embryo or fetus. Do they have a moral duty to maintain their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction by refraining from such lifestyle choices?",Abortiondebate,56.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jc47ep/do_women_have_a_moral_duty_to_keep_their_bodies/

Unfortunately, she began having intense bleeding a few days ago (at around 6 weeks). We went to the hospital, worrying that it might be ectopic. They did an ultrasound and could barely see the gestational sac. They couldnt visualize a yolk or pole. They told us she was 5 weeks and 3 days pregnant by the imaging and that her HCG levels were relatively low for 6 weeks (around 830). They told us that the bleeding indicated that shes likely miscarrying. She had intense bleeding and was releasing clots for the last few days, but its just spotting now. Her pregnancy symptoms kind of just went away. All of these signs made us think that she already passed the tissue. 

Today, we went for a follow up with her ob-gyn and the sac wasnt just there, but it got larger. The yolk was a bit more visualized today although no embryo was seen. She couldnt see the pole. We were so confused but the doctor said that shes 99.9% sure that shes going to pass the tissue anyway. They took her bloodwork today as well to get some more insight. 

Now, my concern is two fold: 
1) is it likely that she wont be able to pass the tissue herself? What happens then? If the sac is still present and its growing, what does that mean? Is it a blighted ovum? 

2) is there any scientifically reasonable chance shes still pregnant? We were very upset the last few days and my wife just got over the fact that she likely miscarried, but after the ultrasound today, were both in an even more anxious mood, worrying she hasnt passed the tissue.

2025-03-16,1742094446.0,CMV: Eugenics is being practiced in the USA right now and that is a good thing.,"The high rate of abortions following a Down syndrome screening sometimes exceeding 90% i can lead to a significant reduction in the prevalence of the condition. Resembling the effects of eugenics, it reflects a societal bias against disabilities, effectively ""weeding out"" a specific genetic trait.

Eugenics per wikipedia: is a set of beliefs and practices that aim to improve the genetic quality of a human population -&gt;This in itself seems a good ""improving genetic quality of the human population""

Eugenics is stigmatized due to the racist evils of Nazi Germany, but it's goal of improving a populations health and other desirable characteristics is not evil in it's self.

It will obviously need to be controlled but once we can select and screen fetuses and embryos for positive characteristics such as good health (e.g. not having mental or physical illnesses), long life, physical strength, intelligence that will improve society we should and it can be argued it would be immoral to the next generation not to do so e.g. we are treating them poorly

Once genetic selection becomes  a societal norm similar to  how immunizing a child is expected today, It will be seem negligent to opt out, much like skipping vaccines is viewed now.

  
TLDR:  
Downs syndrome screening is eugenics "" a set of beliefs and practices that aim to improve the genetic quality of a human population"".  
This itself is a good and is tainted by a history of racism and discrimination which doesn't need to apply to eugenics in future. Though obvious caution and safeguards should be applied

My first appointment is Monday but this is my 3rd baby and I have not had any issues during pregnancy before other than with my thyroid but that's a condition I have outside of being pregnant and have managed to get it under control at some point throughout my previous 2 pregnancies. Outside of the sudden onset of blurred vision and all I have honestly had a lot less pregnancy symptoms this time as I did before. For example I had morning sickness the entire time with both of my boys but have felt fine this time.

Ive just hit 32 weeks and Ive had excruciating headaches all week. Saw my midwife and my bp was 133/82 so she said its not high enough to be a concern and to ring the gp for stronger pain meds. Paracetamol wont touch the headaches and no protein in urine either.
Woke up today to horrible nausea and now I cannot stop vomiting. Ive emptied the contents of my stomach and Ive even ran out of bile to throw up. Even the tiniest drop of water sets the vomiting off.

2025-03-16,1742137469.0,"Those with severe nausea/vomiting that went away, was it gradual or sudden?","I hope I worded this correctly!

I'm currently 10w3d and experienced severe nausea and vomiting since about 5 weeks (6 weeks on the dot with the vomiting). I was given Reglan that improved it for a couple days before doing nothing at all besides give me shakiness in my muscles, so I stopped. I got to the point of throwing up about 3-5 times a day and always after a solid meal, went to the ER at 8 weeks because severe dehydration was causing my back and ab muscles to cramp so bad I legitimately thought I had an ectopic (I was also spotting a bit prior), they confirmed baby was progressing as expected with a strong heartbeat and textbook structure/size. They gave me a few days worth of Zofran but my doctor refused to refill because he hadn't seen me yet. Regardless, Zofran was effective for only most of those days but did not stop the puking altogether and the last day I had it, it felt like it did nothing. The nausea was getting worse so out of pure desperation I took the Reglan again and dealt with the unwanted symptoms.

I want to say my nausea peaked (so far) last Wednesday night, I threw up/dry heaved 9 times that day, had an absolute delirious mental episode and considered going to the ER before I eventually just passed out on my bed. Thursday hitting the 10 week mark, I felt *slightly* better but still puking. Friday, puked 3 times. Yesterday once, all acid though, but more bone tired than usual like it was a trade off- first time having solid food since Wednesday.  I never stopped actually being nauseous all day even throughout this. 

This morning my nausea resembled more hunger pains than an actual urge to puke. I feel far more lucid. I don't want to jinx myself, I've been fooled before, but I am at the moment feeling 80% more ""normal."" I've been warned about sudden ends to symptoms as something potentially bad, especially since I read that most people reach their peak nausea symptoms around 10 weeks *if* it's a first trimester thing only, and lasting until 12-14 weeks. 

I guess I'm just looking for a peace of mind. I'm not even sure if I should really call my current symptoms progression as a gradual improvement since the nausea never wavered until literally just this morning. I'm holding on the hope that my boobs are still sore and I'm still sluggish that maybe this is actually a good sign and not something to be concerned about.

I get my first scan Thursday so I really won't know anything until then.

I stopped working a few weeks ago and I just feel really overwhelmed by my house right now and I always see the ""nesting"" that should be happening while I'm on my maternity leave but it hasn't happened. I definitely had a burst of energy in the 2nd trimester, did some organizing and got the nursery exactly how I wanted but that energy is long gone now.

Most days I wake up still tired because I don't sleep well throughout the night. I get back spasms pretty often, swollen feet and ankles, all the normal stuff.. especially the more time I spend up doing things. Bending over can be very uncomfortable and I fell a few weeks ago so I have a lot of anxiety about tripping and falling again. (I did land on my hands and knees but it was scary in the moment for sure.)

I know my husband is doing everything he can, we own businesses together so me not being there means he hasn't had a day off in weeks. My father in law will be in town around time of our due date to be able to relieve him but for now, he's just a bit bogged down and I can tell it's definitely impacting him although he never complains. He's wants me to rest, not overdo it too much but I'm genuinely getting anxious about the house. 

Clothing is piling up, I mean to fold and put it away but keep either falling asleep or just generally can't be bothered most of the time. I get the dishwasher ran as much as possible too, but I have 3 dogs and have been having a hard time keeping up with everything. I cleaned the bathroom out really well yesterday when I had a little energy but ended up having a back spasm from the bending over and felt exhausted the rest of the day. 

It makes me just feel lazy most of them time, mostly because i have been... The nursery is completely done, glad I got it done earlier in the pregnancy but it feels like the rest of the house is in disarray and it's making me so anxious. This is my first child so I don't know what to expect and fear I won't have the time or energy when baby comes to be able to handle it either. It's just kinda bumming me out i guess.

I'm 9 weeks today. Supposedly. 
I'm freaking out constantly that maybe it's already gone. 
This is my third pregnancy, the first made it to 8 weeks but didn't develop past 7. Ended in a d&amp;c. The second made it to 7 and had a miscarriage on my own but I knew it was coming because my blood work wasn't great. 
This one I found out about on Valentine's. I'm not going to lie the timing couldn't be worse, 2 weeks after my due date is my brother's wedding that my husband is the best man in, I'm in the bridal party, and it's all happening at my parents house 4 hours away. But I still want this so bad. 
My husband is very encouraging and says we will keep trying as long as it takes but I'm 37. 
I have two different doctors, my normal gyno doesn't do babies anymore so she recommended my OB. I haven't seen the OB this pregnancy yet, I'm supposed to have an appointment this Wednesday and an ultrasound Thursday. I'm now freaking out because I went to look at the times and they're not showing up in the app anymore so if they got cancelled I'm going to cry. 
My normal gyno ordered blood work Feb 19 that was great and an ultrasound on Feb 26th that was also right on track. 
But I am not having morning sickness at all, maybe I'm just lucky. My breasts are tender and I'm extra gassy and very emotional and tired. But that's all my symptoms. It's making me so nervous. I keep wanting to like just keep taking pregnancy tests or something. How do you get over not knowing if it's ok or not? 
Like eventually they move and stuff so I imagine that will be reassuring. But if it's still there this is the furthest I've ever been but I just don't know if it's still there. 
I'm so sorry this is just a ramble. My Brain is fried, my therapist is out of town for a few weeks, I'm having a time haha.

2025-03-16,1742122119.0,Emotional Rollercoaster,"**TLDR:** ***Ive had a lot of physical, emotional, and mentally challenging issues during my pregnancy; and really need some advice or reassurance. If you can share anything, please do. Im sorry its so long, I tried to trim everything down but theres just so much.***

My pregnancy has been more of an emotional rollercoaster than I even thought it could be. Im currently due June 2nd, and Im not sure what all to expect with the last couple months. 

In the first half of my pregnancy, I was diagnosed with HG and was throwing up constantly and unable to keep food or medication down, resulting in me losing around thirty pounds within the first trimester. It was incredibly hard for me and my husband. If I hadnt known I was pregnant I wouldve thought I had cancer or some serious illness. 

We were waiting to tell our families in person, but we live out of state. Just before we went to see them we had our first ultrasound, and got to see the baby for the very first time. It was incredible, and breathtaking. It made it all feel so worth it. I was so glad to see my sickness wasnt effecting him like I was worried it was. 

We finally got to tell our families we were pregnant around week 14, for Thanksgiving. It was absolutely beautiful, and something Ill remember the rest of my life.

Immediately following Thanksgiving, I got incredibly sick, on top of my HG situation. Some sort of respiratory sickness they couldnt put a name on, and couldnt give me medication for at first. For one week, I really thought I was going to die I was so ill. On top of the HG, I couldnt breathe, had severe chest pains that I even went to the ER for because I got so scared, was coughing so hard it made me cry and vomit. It was so painful. I had a mental breakdown, and truly thought the baby might not make it. They ended up finally giving me medication to help at least a little. It took another week to feel like it was getting better.

I was able to get a couple of days at work that week. I had been missing most days of work for two months. I came home on December 12th, and my beloved kitty got her wings that night. It was my first true loss, and it was really hard. 

That next week we found out that we are having a boy, and getting to share the news with family and my husband is something I will cherish forever. It was so wonderful. 

Over Christmas, my HG finally seemed to be letting up. It was amazing. I ate food for the first time in months that wasnt rice or bread. We stayed home instead of seeing family because it had made me so so sick last time, and to spend time with our other pets. It was beautiful, and it even snowed a tiny bit.

Come new years, my HG was back, but my belly was starting to show and we had gotten to see him on ultrasound again. I tried to push through and make it to work. My boss pulled me aside and told me that I whod been missing too much, even with everything going on. That they understood, but if I missed or called out one more day within 8 weeks they would take me to part time and cut my benefits. They acted like I was just staying home because I wanted to and not because I was horribly sick. We were running out of our savings, it wasnt like I didnt need to be there, I couldnt. Adding an entire new stress to my situation. 

We get our 20 week anatomy scan mid January. They were unable to see his face, with his arms up, and needed to get another scan soon to try to check for cleft. They are unable to see his heart fully. They tell me they also saw what may be a tumor is his brain, and will check it again next time. At this point theyve been taking blood and urine samples every time I come in. My white blood cell count is double what it should be and had been that way since I got sick at Thanksgiving. They let me know they are sending me to a specialist but not to worry. I am definitely worried for my little guy.

They schedule me a few more weeks out for another ultrasound. I try to make it to work, as Im in fear of losing my benefits so close to birth. Im throwing up multiple times a day and having to leave my desk constantly. Theyre upset Im not able to grab someone to cover the desk on my way to run to the restroom to vomit. Theyre upset I seem sick, tired, and on the verge of tears at the front desk. Not a good look for them. Exactly why Ive been staying home. 

They got my results back and tell me I might have small kidney stones and to drink a ton of water to try to flush them out. Super easy request seeing as Im still throwing up multiple times a day. 

The specialist is an oncologist. They are watching me to see if I have leukemia. Didnt know that until I literally am sitting in the oncologist office, and shes the one to tell me why Im there. I get they didnt want me to worry. But Im starting to feel like Im falling apart.

Im finally feeling his kicks and movements. Its bringing me a lot of peace, and its so wonderful to feel like hes okay in there. We get our ultrasound and no tumor, no cleft and no heart defect. thank God. We started getting stuff for the nursery and putting things together. The HG is getting lighter. Only a few days a week Im throwing up. I feel like I can truly see the beautiful light at the end of the tunnel.

I developed this cyst in my right breast, that grew from a dime size to about the size of a clementine, and was so incredibly painful. It got red and swollen until it was purple. Again they didnt want to give me antibiotics and there was nothing I could do but put a compress on. I couldnt even wear a bra. I had to keep going to work or they would drop my benefits. Eventually the cyst burst on its own and all this puss came out. It drained for three days. They had to express it further and finally put me on antibiotics. I had that open wound on my breast for about a week, and kept having to rewrap it, to the point the tape was tearing little parts of my skin off. But it did finally heal. 

This past week, Tuesday I wake up with some sort of respiratory situation again. My throat is so sore I cant swallow and have a fever. They still want me to come into work, so I do. 

We woke up Wednesday morning to my beloved dog Sam having some neurological symptoms, and we had to lay her to rest on Wednesday. After thirteen beautiful years. This is the hardest thing Ive ever been through. 

I try to go to work Thursday, but I was so broken I just left. I told my boss I couldnt be here, I couldnt even think. Theyre probably going to fire me. I dont even care anymore. I cant deal with all of this. Im now so incredibly sick, coughing things up, sore throat, drainage etc; if I could, I wouldnt go in to work tomorrow either. 

Please: I need some advice. Any advice. If you been through a rough pregnancy or grieving while going through this, please let me know how you made it. I feel like Im trying my best to keep my head held high but its one thing after another, like waves crashing down on my head and I cant catch my breath.

EDIT: Anywhere I said Advil, Im not taking advil, its off brand Acetaminophen, I got my name brand drugs mixed up,

FTM (22) here, first knowledge of the pregnancy was an at home test, and we are super excited! Id been trying to find an ob/gyn to get scheduled into, but everyone's booked out till April. Cons of being in a town with no other hospitals for 3+ hours.

For a few weeks, id been having terrible right side cramping, enough to bring me to tears in the middle of the night, and overall soreness in my abdomen. After about two weeks, my husband finally forced me to go to the ER to make sure it wasn't ectopic, my appendix, or some other thing. After an ultra sound, the tech looking confused, and two much more in depth ones, they determined I have two endometrial horns? The doc wasn't too entirely sure, but she said that I have a yolk sack w/ no fetal pole in my right horn, and ""small nonspecific fluid or hemorrhage within the left endometrial horn"", along with my right ovary being 2.6x1.9x2.6, and my left one being 4.1x2.1x3.2.

The docs seemed a little concerned, and gave my pregnancy a 50% viability, and wanted me to come back for a repeat quantitative HCG in 48-72 hours, and wanted another ultrasound in 1 week. I was also put on strict pelvic precautions, with no heavy lifting. They referred me to an OB/GYN in branch and sent me on my way.

We came back 3 days later to do the repeat test, and they didn't put in a lab, no one there knew anything about it, they said that was something for my OB to schedule. The only scheduling I can get anywhere close to the ob is with a nurse practitioner New Patient appointment in two weeks. They'll only check my vitals and get me into the system as a patient, a 15 min appointment. I wont even be able to see a doctor. The one they referred me to was on maternity leave, and the only doctor with any slots open was available for mid April, but I cant be scheduled for that at all until my new patient. I cant get in for an ultrasound unless I go back to the ER and check myself in again, or I wait till April to get myself seen by an ob and assessed.

I'm still in a lot of pain, its been about a week calling all over town and even to other towns, and no one can seem to squeeze me in. I cant really sit comfortably, and I don't know if this is normal cramping and I'm being dramatic or what, but work isn't helping me out either. The ER nurse wrote my precautions on my discharge papers, and gave me a note for work, but they ""don't take doctors notes"" and are trying to argue that pushing and pulling carts is ""not lifting because its PUSHING, duh"". I feel like I'm about to pass out on my shifts, but I don't want to go back to the ER just to be told the exact same thing.

Is first trimester usually this rough? I know the vomiting and the tiredness are normal, I can hardly keep anything down and I sleep for 20 hours a day on my days off, but I just cant shake the feeling that somethings fundamentally wrong. I'm taking Advil, but I'm afraid of taking too much, I've always been an anti drugs (for me) kinda person, and its always been ibuprofen that's worked better for me anyways. Independent practices are just as booked up, and I cant de-stress when I'm hurting this much and worried about the baby being okay. Am I doing something wrong, am I missing something?

My husband just blew up (out of nowhere, we've had a good day and haven't even discussed this before) because I'm not ready to let everybody in our lives know about our first pregnancy while I am only 10 weeks in. I would like to wait until the 2nd trimester to tell friends and co-workers (immediate family knows already) and I want to do a fun &amp; thoughtful announcement, which takes time to arrange. He got pissed because he feels like he is lying to his employees when he is at my appointments with me and can't be direct about where he is going &amp; why he will be away from the office for a couple of hours. I don't get why it's particularly his employees' business any way whether it's due to my appointments or any other personal reason. He doesn't owe his private doings to anyone so idk why of all things, this sets him over the edge. To me it's a big fucking deal to announce this pregnancy &amp; I don't want it casually floating amongst a few people and having other friends find out second-hand and not from us. That's the last thing I want to happen.

2025-03-15,1742070086.0,"Do Women Have a Moral Duty to Keep Their Bodies ""Ready"" for Reproduction at All Times?","Late last year, Dr. Rebecca Gomperts (Aid Access, Women on Waves) announced results of a large clinical trial in Moldova, testing the use of a weekly low dose of mifepristone (50 mg) as a contraceptive. The results were promising, with only one pregnancy occurring within 2000 cycles. Furthermore, negative side effects were minimal, with only 4% of the participants experiencing any negative side effects (compared to a 40% negative side effect rate for conventional hormonal contraceptives). Additionally, the low-dose mifepristone was easier to use, requiring only one dose a week, and being more ""forgiving"" of variations in the time the pill is taken. And 89% of the study participants reported that they stopped menstruating while taking mifepristone as a contraceptive. (Probably most women would consider this a positive side effect.)

Because of the positive results, the trials have been expanded to the Netherlands this year. If the results continue to be positive, the plan is to apply to the European Medicines Agency for registration and market authorization to allow this weekly, low-dose mifepristone regimen as a contraceptive throughout the EU.

The method of action for mifepristone as birth control is two-fold: it reduces the rate of ovulation and it thins the endometrial lining of the uterus, making it impossible for a fertilized egg to implant.

([Source](https://msmagazine.com/2025/01/07/mifepristone-weekly-contraceptive-clinical-trials-abortion-pill-birth-control/).)

My primary question for PL supporters is this: 

* Would you have any moral or legal objections to women's use of such a contraceptive? If so, on what grounds?

Here are some secondary questions if you believe that the use of this contraceptive would be immoral:

* If a woman was taking mifepristone as described here *as a contraceptive* and informed her partner that she was doing this before they had sex, and if her partner, knowing this, decided to go ahead and have PIV sex with her, and if one of his sperm fertilized an egg but it failed to implant, whose would be the primary responsibility for the ""death"" of the fertilized egg? (Realistically, neither of them would ever know if this happened, so this is a hypothetical question.)
* *Men's* use of tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, red meat, and food high in trans fats during the months before their partners' conception is associated with higher miscarriage rates, because of these substances' impacts on sperm. ([Source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/a-mans-unhealthy-lifestyle-too-can-lead-to-his-partners-pregnancy-loss/articleshow/64072130.cms?from=mdr).)  If men engage in such unhealthy lifestyles, they are not maintaining their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction, and their choices could result in the ""death"" of a fertilized egg or even an embryo or fetus. Do they have a moral duty to maintain their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction by refraining from such lifestyle choices?",Abortiondebate,56.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jc47ep/do_women_have_a_moral_duty_to_keep_their_bodies/

I had my blood drawn on 3/6, when I was around 10w2d. I had the QNATAL Advanced test through Quest Diagnostics. My results came in today, 3/15, meaning I had a 9 day turnaround time for my results.

* My fetal fraction was 19.39%.
* My results showed no abnormalities, and I tested negative for all tested trisomies.

2025-03-16,1742101915.0,I think Im having a miscarriage. Help please,"Hello,

Im going to give a detailed account of my experience. I may share unnecessary information, but thats because I dont know much about pregnancy or miscarriages.

Im 35. This is my first pregnancy. I removed my IUD 6 months ago but only last month my partner and I checked when was my fertile period and then had sex multiple times around that time.

We were very surprised I got pregnant. It felt easy, since it was the first time we really tried.  It felt very unexpected.

I discovered the pregnancy 5 days ago, and that should have been when it was a little less than 4 weeks long.

The miscarriage:
Day 1: 2 days ago I had some very brown discharge, what look exactly like what I get a day before my period. Later that day I got a little more and what looked like some very dark blood. The quantities seem small, not enough to fill a pad, but also seem a bit more than what I read that was normal to happen. I was supposed to be in the implantation phase.

Together with that I felt constant but very mild cramps. No other pains. I tested again to make sure I was pregnant. I had 3 positive tests already.

Day 2: I had very mild cramps also most of the day, and some very brown discharge in the morning. Maybe enough to cover half of a panty protector type of pad, those small ones.

Day 3: I woke up early this morning feeling still really mild cramps. When I went to pee I noticed very little drops of very dark or brown blood, like spotting, on the toilet paper. A couple drops in the toilet water. 

This is the entire situation. This doesnt look good at all, but I also didnt had any red, or mid period like blood coming out. The tiny cramps feel like something is cooking in my uterus, in a bad way. 

I honestly still dont feel like I had a miscarriage, but all the facts point towards the high chance that its already on the way. Mostly because I seem to have had 4x a higher volume of spotting than the usual, and these damn constant, often hard to notice cramps. Sometimes I feel like Im imagining them because I focus so much at that part of my back.

I am okay (as much as one can be) with the possibility of having a first miscarriage. I know how common these are, they happened so much around me already. And Im honestly already so relieved that my partner and I can conceive. My struggle now is not knowing for sure that the pregnancy is gone. Between the first spotting and then several hours without any spotting yesterday, I went from being almost sure it was going to be a loss to hopeful that maybe that was just the implantation symptoms. Maybe I was spotting more than usual because I do get very heavy period the first 2 days of a period.

Anyway, I of course tried to reach out to a doctor on Friday, when this first started, but couldnt get a hold of one. If anyone here lives in the Netherlands, youll know the struggle.

And I know nobody - other than doctors - can really tell me what is happening for sure, but I would still like to kindly ask for anyone who has similar experiences to share any information that you believe may help me.

And to anyone going through a miscarriage, I hope you have the support of people you love. For what I can tell so far, thats the most important. 

Thank you,

I'm 9 weeks today. Supposedly. 
I'm freaking out constantly that maybe it's already gone. 
This is my third pregnancy, the first made it to 8 weeks but didn't develop past 7. Ended in a d&amp;c. The second made it to 7 and had a miscarriage on my own but I knew it was coming because my blood work wasn't great. 
This one I found out about on Valentine's. I'm not going to lie the timing couldn't be worse, 2 weeks after my due date is my brother's wedding that my husband is the best man in, I'm in the bridal party, and it's all happening at my parents house 4 hours away. But I still want this so bad. 
My husband is very encouraging and says we will keep trying as long as it takes but I'm 37. 
I have two different doctors, my normal gyno doesn't do babies anymore so she recommended my OB. I haven't seen the OB this pregnancy yet, I'm supposed to have an appointment this Wednesday and an ultrasound Thursday. I'm now freaking out because I went to look at the times and they're not showing up in the app anymore so if they got cancelled I'm going to cry. 
My normal gyno ordered blood work Feb 19 that was great and an ultrasound on Feb 26th that was also right on track. 
But I am not having morning sickness at all, maybe I'm just lucky. My breasts are tender and I'm extra gassy and very emotional and tired. But that's all my symptoms. It's making me so nervous.

2025-03-16,1742140819.0,Boyfriend forced me to have an abortion &amp; dumped me 2 days later,"I feel so lost, and I dont know how to move forward. My (now) ex-boyfriend pressured me into having an abortion, making me feel like I had no choice. The concerns over the extent of his forcefulness &amp; controlling behaviour were also logged at the time by the medical professionals at the abortion clinic. Two days later, he dumped me over text, told me he never wants to have children with me completely cut me off, and within two weeks, he was posting date night pictures with someone new, as I lay in bed still recovering physically &amp; mentally. He has a narcissistic mother that also blocked me on the day of my surgery and never even acknowledged that I was pregnant. Its just them two, his father is not around &amp; has a completely new family. Its like they both erased me and my baby overnight.

The worst part isI regret it. I didnt want to go through with it, but I was made to feel like I had no choice. I would cancel consultations until he noticed I was doing that so he would start driving me there, I couldnt take the preparation pill for hours but the amount of force I had received, it made me feel like I would be in serious danger if I kept my baby. Now, Im left with this overwhelming grief that I dont know how to process. I feel like a part of me is missing, and I dont know if Ill ever forgive myself. Its hard to function normally when the pain is this heavy. Its been 3 weeks now and I havent eaten a full meal since the day before the surgery, Im signed off work due to my mental health, I dont have any friends as he completely isolated me, and I get no more than 3 hours sleep a night. 

What makes this even harder is that just 10 days before I conceived, I was told I was infertile. Because of my PCOS, one of my ovaries no longer works, and I was led to believe that getting pregnant naturally would be nearly impossible for me. So when I found out I was pregnant, it felt like a miraclesomething I never thought Id get the chance to experience. And now, knowing that I was forced into giving that up, without knowing if Ill ever get another chance, makes the grief even more unbearable.

2025-03-16,1742087777.0,Married and trying to make a joint decision,"i apologize in advance that I am not the best story-teller. I (28)F and my husband (26)M have been married 5 years and have 2 kids already. A boy and a girl. I never wanted more than that. ESPECIALLY with how difficult our youngest has been. I was supposed to be on the birth control patch but I messed up and put it on 48 hours late and now have found myself unexpectedly pregnant. When I first found out I went to my husband and told him bawling my eyes out because we both know we did not want this and let him bring up the option of abortion because we are in Texas, US. At first he seemed on board although, did seem a little emotional about it. (He is very emotional and I am very logical) I went ahead and bought the abortion pull online and had it shipped to a fedex pick-up in New Mexico (only an hour from me ) and picked it up without communicating that to him, but of course wasnt going to take the pills before talking to him one more time. I brought it up again and he said he had talked to a therapist (I had encouraged him to and sent him several therapists in our network) and said when he talked to the therapist, he said that it seemed we both wanted different things but he was just leaving it up to me so that way it didnt ruin our marriage. This is not how I thought he felt at ALL. I knew he felt a little guilt, but I thought he was onboard with my decision. Anyways, the therapist suggested we both write a pros and cons list for having the baby and sit down together and make sure this is a joint decision, which I agree with, but I worry this isnt going to get us anywhere closer to a joint decision and this is obviously a time sensitive situation. So far, my pros list has like 5 very superficial items and my cons list is 30 items long and very valid reasons. I guess I just need someone else to talk to about this. 

A few of my cons:
-I am so close to a huge promotion at my job and a 50% pay raise and I think being pregnant would stop this progression 
-I am the main caregiver for our kids now and I already feel overwhelmed as is. 
-We would have to put a 6 week old in daycare and Ive never had to leave an infant that soon and it gives me anxiety
-We would need a bigger car and I would want a bigger house and camper to accommodate 
-Our youngest is not potty trained and having to change 2 sets of diapers just stresses me out. 
-The world is built for families of 4
-We would be outnumbered. Which brings up a whole other list of things. 
-The world and economy is shit. (Need I say more?)
- We have no village
I could go on and on and on , but I wont 

My 5 pros which carry no real weight in my mind:
-A bigger family at holidays
-Someone for our youngest to play with
-My friend and I would be pregnant together
-I could have the natural birth I wanted with our 2nd
-I could get my tubes tied after since we will reach our deductible
-Special treatment when pregnant =

2025-03-16,1742127558.0,Post MA and I feel hopeless,"(Throwaway account! Sorry, english is not my first language, pardon my grammar lapses)

Had a successful MA yesterday. Process only took me 4 hours to pass my precious angel. The procedure didnt go very well and heres the context.

March 14,2025
- I asked my live-in partner if he can take a day off this weekend to help me with my MA. I explained and said sorry in advance if I ever sound demanding as this procedure is mentally and emotionally draining for me. He said yes, assured me that he would be there. I already took mifepristone at 11:30am. 
- Later that afternoon, he asked permission if he can report work to fulfill his duties as it was critical for him to decline (hes an engineer and I cant really understand how does his workload looks like on a daily basis) that he also needs to work on Sunday for rotational work. I also told him that I may not understand his workload, but I understand that he needs to focus at work, but the stress hes giving me is just unnecessary.
- As a response, I lashed out on him, voicing out my frustrations and he took it negatively and broke up with me as I was affecting his career.
- At that time, I was really disappointed that he cant fulfill his words.
- ADDITIONAL CONTEXT: 2024 I was at the hospital cause Im about to give birth to our first born, he left me at the hospital for the same reason.. WORK.. that they are understaffed and no one will shoulder his workload. My doctors and midwife even spoke to him to straighten up his priorities as Im in active labor, that they cant proceed with anything unless theres a guardian that can accommodate them if something happens to me, but ofc, as usual, he was really firm with his decision to prioritize his work over his partner. Im new in town and I barely even have friends to ask help with.

March 15 
- at 11:30am already took the first dose of misoprostol and it all came back to me, the abandonment, the neglect from the day I gave birth, and after childbirth, the paternity leave I gave him was just useless, later on I figure out that he didnt disclosed that I was pregnant to his company. And yes, he left me with child care after birth with minimal help as he told me, as he ALWAYS told me that I need to be self-sufficient. And yesterday, it all crashed down on me. The same reason I had to deal with from the times I asked him for help. So I decided to handle things on my own. I went through the process scared, anxious, paranoid and alone.
- He went to work in the morning and went home around 12pm to offer help but my mind is already dysregulated and already disconnected that I refused to receive any help from him. Then he got angry and started shouting and even throwing things inside our room while im actively going through the abortion. Even threatened to hit me but shouted in front of my face instead.
- I was still firm that Im not gonna accept any help from him, the amount of stress that hes giving me is just not helping. So I was left with my 1 year old, crying, doing tantrums while my body is shaking, painfully going through the process. He didnt even bother with child care so I can focus with my process. Idk, hes trying to help but not really helping, shit made me really confused at this point, but oh well, what can I do? I just continued the process with all the emotions that Im feeling. No one to talk to, just trying to seek comfort while watching tiktok clips. 
- 3pm, I was able to finish the procedure and was crying and breaking down for couple of hours after seeing my angel. 
- The next few hours I started bleeding heavily, passing big clots after and cramping so bad that ibuprofen didnt even help to minimize the pain. Fell asleep but woke up around 3am with severe cramping, passed another big clots until dawn. 
- I woke at 3am and I thought It was already done but he even messaged my only friend whos been there for me but was not pro-abortion, telling her that she should check on me as I was doing the abortion. Now my only friend already FOd me as it was against her ethics to tolerate this. I felt betrayed for what he did and disappointed with everything that I just want to die. My grief was beyond comprehension, I just dont understand anything anymore at this point.

March 16
- Post MA today, Im still somewhat heavily bleeding 1 1/2 pads within 2 hours, but I decided to go to the mall as if nothing happened, hoping I can pass out there and die, I was just nauseous and dizzy but still able to walk and even bought groceries for me and my 1 year old baby. 
- I broke down after eating, almost had a panic attack while lining up to the cashier cause I saw a pregnant woman being held by her husband/partner

I just got home and I broke down again. I cant do this anymore, this is just too much for me. My body is trembling and I feel cold. I just dont know how to push forward from here.

2025-03-16,1742147691.0,Medication Abortion - Positive Experience,"Hi all, 25F here, US/North Carolina. I was absolutely terrified to go through with my MA this weekend so I wanted to share my experience in case it helps someone else. 

Some background, I was 5-6 weeks pregnant for my abortion and I am prone to extremely bad menstrual cramps for my normal period, which made me really scared to go through with the misoprostol. In North Carolina, you have to go through a consent appointment 72 hours prior to the abortion, so I did that at a local clinic. It was a bizarre experience where I had an ultrasound, light bloodwork, and counseling (if you can even call it that). 

On Friday I took the mifepristone at the clinic in a room of like 6 other women. I had little to no side effects from the mifepristone, other than emotional effects. I took Naproxen instead of Ibuprofen because it works much better for me, so I started that on Friday. Yesterday I took two rounds of misoprostol (8 pills total). Dissolving them in my mouth was definitely unpleasant but not a huge deal, made my gums kind of sore after. I started cramping within 20-30 minutes and started bleeding about an hour after starting the pills. I took Naproxen an hour before starting the first round and Zofran right before. I prepped with period underwear (dont skip out on this part!) and overnight pads. I had 2 heating pads, one that wraps around my back and one for the front. 

Like I mentioned, my menstrual cramps are horrific normally (Ive taken toradol injections at urgent care for the pain before) and my periods are very heavy (8 days long) so I was worried my abortion pain would be proportional to that, but luckily with the Naproxen and heating pads, it was comparable to a bad period for me. You should definitely prepare to be as sedentary as possible (I found that moving around made the cramps and nausea worse). If you can have someone with you to support you and get anything you need, its a huge help. 

I passed the pregnancy about 4 hours after the first round which is about when I started the second round of misoprostol. I made sure to eat something and drink electrolyte drinks before the second round because the nausea and stomach cramps were pretty bad. I had some diarrhea as well. By the second round of misoprostol, I had already passed the largest clots and it was just a lot of bleeding by that point. I used about 5-6 overnight pads the first night. Make sure you have a heating pad with an automatic timer/shut off so you can go to sleep with it on. I made sure to take another Naproxen before I went to bed at about midnight. Unfortunately, for some reason 12am-3am was kind of the worst of the pain for me, idk if it was the stomach cramps and nausea or what but that was the hardest part, but still not the worst pain Ive ever experienced. By the time I woke up in the morning, the worst of it was over and I didnt need any pain meds anymore. Im still having mild cramping today but overall it had not been NEARLY as bad as I expected. I expected to be crying all night from the pain, but I never got to that point. Here are the items I found most helpful:
- Period underwear
- Thick overnight pads
- Electrolyte drinks (hydration will help your nausea) 
- Wrap around heating pad with automatic shut off timer
- Zofran/anti nausea medication and pain medication that works best for you
- Popsicles and Italian ices (the cold helped my nausea)
- Applesauce and rice (to be able to take the meds) 
- All the distraction items you might need. Video games, books, movies chosen beforehand, etc. 

My DMs are open if anyone has questions about my experience or needs to vent. This was one of the hardest things Ive ever had to go through so Im happy to help you through it.

2025-03-16,1742130618.0,Cramping on left side 3 weeks after medical abortion,"Hey guys, I need some advice. About 3 weeks ago I had a medical abortion at 6 weeks pregnant. I ordered the pills online, it's my second abortion so I didn't go to a doctor, also just for the simple fact that I have state insurance and it's very hard to find a provider around me that covers the cost of an abortion.

But for the last 2 days, I have had cramping that is specifically on my left side. It radiates to my hip and I can feel it in my leg, butt and back as well. It feels just a tad bit more intense than my normal period cramps but nothing crazy. My bleeding has started lightening up over the past day or 2, but this cramping has just been so consistent over the past 2 days that I'm starting to worry. Last night I decided to take a pregnancy test just to make sure that my hcg levels were going down, but it still came back very positive.

I can say that I did see the sac come out when I had my abortion, so I know that my body dispelled SOMETHING. All of my bleeding was normal and everything had passed. I guess I'm just concerned about a potential ectopic pregnancy? I've never experienced one so I'm not sure what that pain would feel like. The cramping just feels very odd, especially for how directed it is in my left side and it's not just a general cramping feeling in my uterus.

Just figured i'd post on here and ask if anyone has experienced anything like this before taking myself over to the ER to get an ultrasound done....",abortion,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jcl3oj/cramping_on_left_side_3_weeks_after_medical/
2025-03-16,1742136839.0,Abortion is Absolutely Justified,"Premises:

1. Moral worth is based on current capacity for sentience, as **only sentient beings can experience harm**.

2. A pre-sentient fetus **lacks the ability to experience harm** and has no present interests.

3. Forcing a sentient person to remain pregnant **imposes significant physical, psychological, and emotional harm**.

4. Future potential does not create present moral worth; moral status depends on actual characteristics, **not hypothetical ones**.

5. When a **moral conflict** arises, the entity capable of experiencing harm (the pregnant person) has **greater moral weight** than a non-sentient fetus.

Conclusion:

Before fetal sentience, abortion is morally justified because **there is no meaningful harm to the fetus**, while forcing pregnancy **significantly harms a sentient person**.

2025-03-16,1742089792.0,What are my options to join the church without husband due to his previous marriage?,"The title is weird, but let me explain. My husband is my first and only marriage and we've been married for almost 21 years now. I am my husband's second marriage. Neither of us are officially Catholic but have been worshipping and living our lives according to the Catholic church's teaching for many years now. Here is my question.   
  
My husband has memory issues and SEVERE mental health issues stemming from the military. He cannot and straight up will not at this point go through the process of spiritual annulment from his first wife. His first wife was previously married before my husband to a Catholic man and she was an atheist. They had a kid together and got divorced. She married my husband. Obviously no spiritual annulment there from the first husband. He (my husband) never intended to stay with her and only married her out of guilt due to getting her pregnant and fear but always knew he'd leave. She cheated on him with who is now her current husband. We're not even sure where they live.  We haven't been in contact with her in a decade and in fact have a legal no contact order with his entire family. (We got the order not the other way around)

We've contacted our local Parish and sat down with a deacon who explained the annulment process. At first they told me I could join alone and would have to swear to not have sexual relations with my husband. Given his mental state I am actually willing that and am able to make that vow. My husband doesn't feel the same need and drive to join the church as I do. Mostly due to his mental state. They then decided that wasn't an option for some reason and told me the ONLY way I personally could join would be if he did the annulment. My husband is currently in the hospital for the 34th time due to his mental state and wanting to unalive himself (prayers would be greatly appreciated as medications have all failed). 

During our meeting they brought up several theories that, for example, my husband's marriage to her wasn't valid due to the whole lack of annulment from first husband. They also talked about how my husband is baptized (Lutheran) but she wasn't. They brought up the whole cheating aspect and what they finally determined was my husband's ""best scenario"" was stating he married her under false pretenses due to his never intending to stay due to the child growing up ""enough"" one day.   All of this is a moot point as he is unwilling and incapable of writing the paperwork out. I'm his legal guardian too if that shows you how unwell he is. 

I feel stuck and left out of what I consider to be my own faith. When I lived in another state they allowed me to receive the Eucharist even though I hadn't ""officially joined yet"". Good bad or otherwise I don't want to argue that, it is what it is. I miss being that close with Jesus. Yes he is with me daily, but it still feels like I'm missing something.  

I will not divorce my husband. Even with his mental state the way it is I love him with my whole being and I won't abandon him. 

Is there any way for me to join the Catholic church officially if he is unable/unwilling to help me with his annulment. Ps I hope this was understandable. I confused myself even while writing it.

Kind of looking for advice and guidance here&

Im almost at my due date and feeling mentally more and more unstable. Not because of the delivery or postpartum, but because of (irrational) fears and anxiety. 
Im feeling over protective already and am creating scenarios in my head that are driving me crazy. As a result Im feeling sad, angry and terrified all the time. For example Im scared that after the delivery the baby will be taken away from me and I wont have that golden hour skin to skin (for whatever reason) or that family or grand parents will come by uninvited and claim the baby as their own. 
Ive been judged when I said that I would like to spend the first day(s) with my husband and the baby alone to bond saying that Im robbing the grand parents from their time with their first grand baby. It already feels that I owe people MY child that I carried. Im scared that when the baby leaves my body that I have to share him (even with my husband) and that I wont even matter anymore, cause I was just the body that was needed to make this human. 
Im angry at my husband all the time and although he says he wont tell anyone once we have the baby or send pics of the baby without my consent, I struggling to believe him because I will be tired and weak and wont be able to control everything. This is so not me..
Im a midwife and nurse myself so I should know that my anxiety is exaggerated. Im scared that this overbearing will drive me in a postpartum psychosis. Any of you who experienced these feelings?",pregnant,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jc79bz/38w_and_lots_of_anxiety/

Im not too sure what to do here. Im at 20 weeks, so far everything has been great during this pregnancy, but it seems the last two weeks my health is going haywire. The baby is perfectly fine, which Im super happy about. 

Recently got diagnosed with GD at 18 weeks. My blood pressure recently has been elevated, 152/90 as of 3/14. Ive never had high blood pressure before. Last appointment (last week) was 140/60. And my heart rate wont rest below 113. My thyroid levels are also way off (had It removed a couple years ago due to cancer), which they think might be throwing off my heart rate. 

Ive been doing so good with the GD and diet and all that, but now the BP is another obstacle I need to figure out. I did the urine test early on and passed it so preeclampsia wasnt a worry. Theyre having me do it again to see if preeclampsia is now a factor. I dont have any hand or foot swelling and no headaches. 

Has anyone had to deal with GD and HBP during pregnancy? Was there anything you were able to do to help with the HBP? Im going to attempt to cut out a looooot of salt from my diet to see if that helps at all. Ive also only been drinking water since week 16 when I failed the one hour glucose test in case it became a concern later on.

I'm currently 10w3d and experienced severe nausea and vomiting since about 5 weeks (6 weeks on the dot with the vomiting). I was given Reglan that improved it for a couple days before doing nothing at all besides give me shakiness in my muscles, so I stopped. I got to the point of throwing up about 3-5 times a day and always after a solid meal, went to the ER at 8 weeks because severe dehydration was causing my back and ab muscles to cramp so bad I legitimately thought I had an ectopic (I was also spotting a bit prior), they confirmed baby was progressing as expected with a strong heartbeat and textbook structure/size. They gave me a few days worth of Zofran but my doctor refused to refill because he hadn't seen me yet. Regardless, Zofran was effective for only most of those days but did not stop the puking altogether and the last day I had it, it felt like it did nothing. The nausea was getting worse so out of pure desperation I took the Reglan again and dealt with the unwanted symptoms.

I want to say my nausea peaked (so far) last Wednesday night, I threw up/dry heaved 9 times that day, had an absolute delirious mental episode and considered going to the ER before I eventually just passed out on my bed. Thursday hitting the 10 week mark, I felt *slightly* better but still puking. Friday, puked 3 times. Yesterday once, all acid though, but more bone tired than usual like it was a trade off- first time having solid food since Wednesday.  I never stopped actually being nauseous all day even throughout this. 

This morning my nausea resembled more hunger pains than an actual urge to puke. I feel far more lucid. I don't want to jinx myself, I've been fooled before, but I am at the moment feeling 80% more ""normal."" I've been warned about sudden ends to symptoms as something potentially bad, especially since I read that most people reach their peak nausea symptoms around 10 weeks *if* it's a first trimester thing only, and lasting until 12-14 weeks. 

I guess I'm just looking for a peace of mind. I'm not even sure if I should really call my current symptoms progression as a gradual improvement since the nausea never wavered until literally just this morning. I'm holding on the hope that my boobs are still sore and I'm still sluggish that maybe this is actually a good sign and not something to be concerned about.

2025-03-16,1742122461.0,Spotting due to medication or a pregnancy,"Spotting due to medication or potential pregnancy

Hi all,

I am 40 and my wife is 36.

We have an 8 year old and my wife got an IUD fitted 7.5 years back.

Also, we had been having unprotected sex since then.

She has a regular 28 day cycle (had never missed any except for during her first pregnancy earlier) and had a last due date on March 6th.

We consulted a gynaec and did a pregnancy check with an hcg test on the 9th (3 days from her due date that came out negative).

But there was a confusion as she had experienced some sensitivity and increase in her size of her breasts (from the 3rd day onwards).

She was prescribed deviry 10 mg to resume her menses for 5 days.

It was the 5th and last day of the medication yesterday and she has observed a bit of spotting day before yesterday and today.

If the spotting is considered a side effect of deviry (and that her regular periods can be expected anytime within the next 7-10 days), is there a possibility that she is still pregnant if the periods do not resume in this scenario.

Please share your opinions.

2025-03-15,1742073942.0,First trimester scaries,"Hi there! 
I'm 9 weeks today. Supposedly. 
I'm freaking out constantly that maybe it's already gone. 
This is my third pregnancy, the first made it to 8 weeks but didn't develop past 7. Ended in a d&amp;c. The second made it to 7 and had a miscarriage on my own but I knew it was coming because my blood work wasn't great. 
This one I found out about on Valentine's. I'm not going to lie the timing couldn't be worse, 2 weeks after my due date is my brother's wedding that my husband is the best man in, I'm in the bridal party, and it's all happening at my parents house 4 hours away. But I still want this so bad. 
My husband is very encouraging and says we will keep trying as long as it takes but I'm 37. 
I have two different doctors, my normal gyno doesn't do babies anymore so she recommended my OB. I haven't seen the OB this pregnancy yet, I'm supposed to have an appointment this Wednesday and an ultrasound Thursday. I'm now freaking out because I went to look at the times and they're not showing up in the app anymore so if they got cancelled I'm going to cry. 
My normal gyno ordered blood work Feb 19 that was great and an ultrasound on Feb 26th that was also right on track. 
But I am not having morning sickness at all, maybe I'm just lucky. My breasts are tender and I'm extra gassy and very emotional and tired. But that's all my symptoms. It's making me so nervous. I keep wanting to like just keep taking pregnancy tests or something. How do you get over not knowing if it's ok or not? 
Like eventually they move and stuff so I imagine that will be reassuring. But if it's still there this is the furthest I've ever been but I just don't know if it's still there. 
I'm so sorry this is just a ramble. My Brain is fried, my therapist is out of town for a few weeks, I'm having a time haha.

My husband and I always been on the same page for the names but recently thats come into question. We originally agreed on Thomas Ike and Margaret (Maggie) May. There wasnt an inspiration behind either we just liked the names. 

So what changed? In January my grandfather died and while it was something we were expecting, it really rocked me. It made me think about how present he was in my life and how missed he is. Ive cried nearly every week since his death and it still hits me at random times and places. It really is such a strange thing to be grieving life while growing new life inside you. 

Due to this impact, I recently started thinking about changing our boy name to Thomas Lawrence Lawrence was my grandfathers middle name. I spoke to my husband about this thought and he said ultimately he would be on board if thats the route I want to move in but he feels like the recent grief is heavy on my heart and thats whats inspiring the name change. He is correct. But since the convo I really have no idea anymore. Ive sat on the question independently for about a month and still cant make up my mind. 

Im also worried because since Ive started telling people the names we have, that Ike is an atypical name. It normally makes people stop and question if we said Mike or just flat out misheard me. It makes me worry if we have a boy and I go with the original name that Im setting him up for a life of having to correct people.  

Should we change our boy name to Thomas Lawrence or keep the name as Thomas Ike?

I know they arent Braxton Hicks, because my Braxton Hicks were much different. I go in and they observe me for a bit and they tell me that they think they are just going to discharge me. They believe that this is early labor, but to go home and rest. They let me know its about shift change so a different resident will probably be discharging me. I say ok and wait for a while. This new resident comes in and says that Im getting a cervical exam. I havent gotten one yet, so I have no clue what its like. He explained that he finds it necessary if Im having contractions. He does the exam and says I am 4cm dilated. The nurse goes, no she cant be, she would be a lot more uncomfortable if so. She says that shed like to check. She does and she says Im about 1cm or possibly 2cm. He says he doesnt agree and asks to do another. He does and says that Im 1cm. He says that he must have put his hand on the wrong tissue. He leaves and the nurse asked whos hurt worse, and I told her, the residents did. Mind you I have a higher pain tolerance, and I wanted to cry. She explained that she thinks I would be in more discomfort if I was further along and she believes Im about 30% effaced and 1.5 cm dilated. She says that she believes that he did it wrong. She explained that she didnt have to go far to check and that baby is very far down. She then says shes going to give me the group b strep test. She leaves and comes back in and says they are going to see if Ive progressed at all in 2 hours, but she wont be there. She says that they saw pink discharge after so I should be aware of light spotting but thats all. I wait and get the second cervical check by the same male resident. It hurts almost more. He says that I have no change and that Im 1 cm and that Im going to be discharged and that its just round ligament pain. The other nurse there says that it could be early labor and to not worry and come back if its worse. At this point Im so uncomfortable. I am having horrible spotting and pain. I still 2 days later am having small spotting along with horrible pain and discomfort. Some sharp and some more cramping.

I have genuinely not changed my calorie intake from pre-pregnancy and I think that's what's so frustrating to me. I eat the same portions, and haven't had intense cravings or anything along those lines. But I'm still gaining weight. 

The big problem is up until 3 weeks ago, my blood pressure was normal! No issues whatsoever. I monitor it at home and at the doc appts of course. Now, at 30 weeks pregnant it is high and stressing me out. 140s/80s. 

On top of that I have failed both 1 hr glucose tests I was given by 10mg and even though I already passed my first 3 hr glucose test, I have to go in for a 2nd one tomorrow. I'm terrified of failing it. 

The rational part of me knows that this is related to the pregnancy but I keep hearing stories of women who started getting high blood pressure during pregnancy and it never went away and now they've been on meds for 10+ years. 

But I'm scared of what gestational diabetes AND high blood pressure may result in for me and my baby in these final weeks. 

I'm soooo tired all the time and can barely walk without being winded.  Where as before I was actually pretty active for a plus size girl. I just feel like it's all my fault, and I don't have the energy to fight this. I need to make changes but it all seems like no matter if I do, it's not going to be good enough this late in the game. 

Does anyone have any recommendations or anything that drastically helped? Maybe I also need to hear the bad stories to get my ass into gear and start making some lifestyle changes. It's tough when everyone around you tells you ""it's okay you're eating for two now"" and gives you food all the time.

2025-03-16,1742140120.0,Hi,"Hi

Yesterday I had a positive pregnancy test so thought I would join this subreddit again. I have 2 boys who are 6 and 3 so this will be my third baby.

Im roughly just over 4 weeks pregnant. I thought I was as my period was 4 days late but I had been testing with some cheap test strips from the day I was due on and they all came back negative. I then did a more expensive test &amp; digital test as I felt pregnant and its unusual for my period to be 4 days late and they both came back positive. 

Excited to be joining this community again even though it all seems a bit surreal at the moment and also slightly worried about life with 3 children as my boys are very active and I feel some days are already pretty chaotic!! Me and my husband are pretty go with the flow people so hopefully we wont feel too overstretched!!

Hey yall&.let me start off with this. I know a lot of pregnancies dont have bad things happen during them. 

I (22 F), and my fiancé (23 M), have been talking about children and how many we want and how we want to raise them since forever. Weve been together since I was 18. 

But, Ive started thinking.  What if my pregnancy doesnt go as planned? Theres sooooo many things that could go wrong bc of&well everything. Im terrified of the idea of getting pregnant. Im scared. I want a baby with my spouse so badly though within the next year or two. But Im terrified. What if I fail my baby? What if I miscarry. What if baby grows incorrectly or they are born with a disability (Id still love them dw). What if they grow outside of the womb? What if&&the list goes on and on and on. 


And Ive thought about it all. I miscarried (BD killed it) at 16. Ive talked to my OGBYN and asked if she thought I was infertile because of this. She said she doubts it. Also. My fiancé made a joke the other day. That he would freaking leave me if I was infertile. Now Im even more scared. 


How would he handle it if I gave birth to an unhealthy baby. Or if I have issues with miscarrying babies? My grandmother miscarried a baby boy before my mom was born. Im so scared. I just dont know. Id be devastated if I just couldnt&have children. Also the world we are in today scares me just as much. I was talking with finance about it. Especially about a baby girl. I had a really hard childhood. I had an alcoholic abusive father. I was SA multiple times by multiple men. I was almost trafficked. I have been attacked, I went through substance abuse. I got in a bad crowd. Stuffed with mental health and still do. 

Am I overthinking all of this? Like I feel like I have every reason to fear the future. But also. The joy a child would bring to my life would be immense. Ive always dreamed of having a big family and being a mother. But&..what if it doesnt go as planned? I just dont know. I know that yall may laugh at this. But its a genuine fear.

EDIT: Anywhere I said Advil, Im not taking advil, its off brand Acetaminophen, I got my name brand drugs mixed up,

FTM (22) here, first knowledge of the pregnancy was an at home test, and we are super excited! Id been trying to find an ob/gyn to get scheduled into, but everyone's booked out till April. Cons of being in a town with no other hospitals for 3+ hours.

For a few weeks, id been having terrible right side cramping, enough to bring me to tears in the middle of the night, and overall soreness in my abdomen. After about two weeks, my husband finally forced me to go to the ER to make sure it wasn't ectopic, my appendix, or some other thing. After an ultra sound, the tech looking confused, and two much more in depth ones, they determined I have two endometrial horns? The doc wasn't too entirely sure, but she said that I have a yolk sack w/ no fetal pole in my right horn, and ""small nonspecific fluid or hemorrhage within the left endometrial horn"", along with my right ovary being 2.6x1.9x2.6, and my left one being 4.1x2.1x3.2.

The docs seemed a little concerned, and gave my pregnancy a 50% viability, and wanted me to come back for a repeat quantitative HCG in 48-72 hours, and wanted another ultrasound in 1 week. I was also put on strict pelvic precautions, with no heavy lifting. They referred me to an OB/GYN in branch and sent me on my way.

We came back 3 days later to do the repeat test, and they didn't put in a lab, no one there knew anything about it, they said that was something for my OB to schedule. The only scheduling I can get anywhere close to the ob is with a nurse practitioner New Patient appointment in two weeks. They'll only check my vitals and get me into the system as a patient, a 15 min appointment. I wont even be able to see a doctor. The one they referred me to was on maternity leave, and the only doctor with any slots open was available for mid April, but I cant be scheduled for that at all until my new patient. I cant get in for an ultrasound unless I go back to the ER and check myself in again, or I wait till April to get myself seen by an ob and assessed.

I'm still in a lot of pain, its been about a week calling all over town and even to other towns, and no one can seem to squeeze me in. I cant really sit comfortably, and I don't know if this is normal cramping and I'm being dramatic or what, but work isn't helping me out either. The ER nurse wrote my precautions on my discharge papers, and gave me a note for work, but they ""don't take doctors notes"" and are trying to argue that pushing and pulling carts is ""not lifting because its PUSHING, duh"". I feel like I'm about to pass out on my shifts, but I don't want to go back to the ER just to be told the exact same thing.

Is first trimester usually this rough? I know the vomiting and the tiredness are normal, I can hardly keep anything down and I sleep for 20 hours a day on my days off, but I just cant shake the feeling that somethings fundamentally wrong. I'm taking Advil, but I'm afraid of taking too much, I've always been an anti drugs (for me) kinda person, and its always been ibuprofen that's worked better for me anyways. Independent practices are just as booked up, and I cant de-stress when I'm hurting this much and worried about the baby being okay. Am I doing something wrong, am I missing something?

Unfortunately, she began having intense bleeding a few days ago (at around 6 weeks). We went to the hospital, worrying that it might be ectopic. They did an ultrasound and could barely see the gestational sac. They couldnt visualize a yolk or pole. They told us she was 5 weeks and 3 days pregnant by the imaging and that her HCG levels were relatively low for 6 weeks (around 830). They told us that the bleeding indicated that shes likely miscarrying. She had intense bleeding and was releasing clots for the last few days, but its just spotting now. Her pregnancy symptoms kind of just went away. All of these signs made us think that she already passed the tissue. 

Today, we went for a follow up with her ob-gyn and the sac wasnt just there, but it got larger. The yolk was a bit more visualized today although no embryo was seen. She couldnt see the pole. We were so confused but the doctor said that shes 99.9% sure that shes going to pass the tissue anyway. They took her bloodwork today as well to get some more insight. 

Now, my concern is two fold: 
1) is it likely that she wont be able to pass the tissue herself? What happens then? If the sac is still present and its growing, what does that mean? Is it a blighted ovum? 

2) is there any scientifically reasonable chance shes still pregnant? We were very upset the last few days and my wife just got over the fact that she likely miscarried, but after the ultrasound today, were both in an even more anxious mood, worrying she hasnt passed the tissue. Its just a reminder every time we think about it. ",pregnant,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jcpyr1/6_week_ultrasound_questions/

 I'm both extremely excited about this baby and incredibly nervous. Me and my fiancé always thought it would be at least two years until this happens, as we've been using condoms combined with FAM for contraception for ages. To add to that, exactly around the time I was ovulating I was sick with the flu and by the time I felt better and up for fooling around it had been 24 hours since I ovulated so we thought we were safe. So it's an unexpected pregnancy, but we're not mad about it.
We're anxious as we're just finishing up university this summer. He's been working part time for a year already and he's going to go full time as soon as we're done with our thesis, but we're worried about money a little bit. We do have a place to live where we don't pay rent so that's sorted.
We're also scared about our families' reactions as we really don't know how they'll take the news when we decide to share.

I am currently 9 weeks pregnant. Have told some people but not all. Having a slightly tough time but all normal sickness and tiredness.

My question is, I'm really struggling recently with socialising. My friendship groups are mainly pub based and I very much enjoy hanging out and drinking usually. However since being pregnant I'm finding these evenings so difficult. Obviously not drinking at the moment and I'm usually the only one in the group. The evening usually starts well but as everyone else gets more drunk, I find myself getting tired and just really frustrated with how loud everyone is being, how they're talking over each other, how the conversation gets so hard to contribute to. So I find that I'm sat there getting more and more annoyed at everyone, tired and just wishing the night was over. I feel like a bad sport if I go home early but equally I also worry I'm bringing the vibe down, even though if I try and contribute, I'm usually yelled over by louder, drunk and more energetic people.

I don't want to stop socialising but I'm also starting to slightly dread these nights out which end so rubbish for me

2025-03-16,1742112899.0,Rejected by best friend for being pregnant,"My best friend just cant handle the fact that I want to have a baby and live a heteronormative life. So today, 5 days out from my scheduled c section, she texted me that our friendship is essentially over and shes processing the grief so I need to leave her space. To be clear, she very much wants to stay in my life, but not my babys (wtf lol, shes absolutely not invited-ever- to meet my baby) and shes trying to recover from this perceived betrayal Ive taken with my life choices. 

Making this post as I feel very alone. 

**Background:**
Im 37, married, financially and emotionally stable, have so much support from extended family, am employed with very good parental leave (I live in Germany so its 14 months paid)& Im laying this out to explain that having a baby is not a dumb or rash decision, and that isnt her basis for criticism. 

**The issues:**
I am giving birth in 5 days to a very wanted baby and my best friend has been nothing but negative and mean about it from the beginning. 

For example, I told her Im pregnant and she wrote back RIP to your life, I brushed it off as a joke. She asked me why I would do that, ruin my life, give it up for a life of screaming and hell etc etc. 

**she hates my nursery** love interior design and spent a lot of time and money getting the nursery together. I commissioned my friend who is an artist to paint a custom mural on the wall tying in my cultural history and my husbands cultural history. Its fckn cute. When I showed my best friend I was so proud and she commented  about how ugly it is and she hates it but followed up with oh well at least i dont have to spend any time here looking at it. I let it go. I also got a super rare antique Murano glass chandelier for the room and I know its beautiful. She told me its tacky. Since then she brought up 3 times without prompting or being asked how much she hates the baby room. 

**worst case scenario births** When I was about 16 weeks pregnant and vomiting all day she took it upon herself to outline every single worst case scenario that can happen in birth, from permanent fecal incontenance, to having your uterus removed. I told her to stop (this was via text) and she pushed back and told me I was brainwashed by propaganda and if I knew the truth I would never even have a baby& Its her job to educate me. (Was super offensive and disturbing). 

**life ruined** At about 25 weeks she explained how much my career will suffer and how men avoid doing work within the home and women end up doing everything, about male weaponised incompetence etc.  also about mothers judging each other in mother groups and how bitchy it is (I get that but she knows my scandanavian husband and whats hes like- we have such an equal partnership). 

**c section** It came to a head yesterday when I texted her to tell her Im having a c section on Friday. I said c section on Friday, omg Im so excited and scared. She wrote back the next day well this is your last free weekend ever& you should go out and party. I guess thats not a bad response but it just was the last straw. I told her im sensitive at the moment and I need support and Im genuinely being hurt by her constant barbs and negativity. If she cant be at least neutral then I need some space.

She wrote back that she thanks me for telling her my needs and she will tell me her needs tomorrow. Then I got this big list about how she doesnt believe in motherhood and having babies from a political standpoint, she is genuinely disgusted by babies, she is **grieving the loss of my friendship** (totally news to me since I didnt know we werent friends anymore!). 

Anyways Im just down about it all. Making this post to see if anyone has any words about similar experiences or how to handle the situation. Shes been a big part of my life and strong support and great friend so Im honestly hurt.

And its also sad that shes given me so much negativity about babies and birth that it has overshadowed my excitement for the birth. I mean, I just wrote her one message and end up in this huge discussion about how hard this is for her, and feeling like I need to apologise to her for having a baby .
Is she trying to be mean ? I dont get it 

Edit: shes self diagnosed autistic on the spectrum which is why I have given her so much Lee-way. Im asking myself at what point is it ok to stop being understanding and letting it go ",pregnant,131.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jcgsyf/rejected_by_best_friend_for_being_pregnant/

2025-03-16,1742136501.0,How do I tell my boyfriend I want our daughter to have my last name?,"A little bit of context - I (26F) am 8 months pregnant with my (32M) boyfriends daughter. 

We unexpectedly got pregnant and found out in August of last year. Once we found out, my entire world changed. I obviously stopped drinking, vaping, caffeine, everything to ensure I had a healthy, safe pregnancy (which thankfully I have). My boyfriend struggled with the change. For months, I found him sneaking alcohol behind my back, hiding drinking from me, and being completely irresponsible. We had the talk many times before that if this happened abortion was not an option (for me, I am 100% pro choice though). Here is why: 

I have worked very hard to become financially stable and independent. I purchased my first home at 24 which we live in together (everything is in my name). I have a full time job that I have been at for 3 years with great benefits (including the health insurance that has gotten us 100% through this pregnancy). I work from home and have the ability to keep my daughter home with me once she is born, and 3 months of paid maternity leave. I put money in savings every month and only have a car payment/mortgage. So in my mind, and what we agreed to before, was if I got pregnant we would keep the baby. 

Over the last 8 months, our relationship has really struggled. He has not been supportive or helped me in any way. I have purchased everything for the baby (almost $4,000 worth), paid for our maternity photos, scheduled all the doctors appointments, cooked my own meals, did the nursery alone. All while he was drinking (which he finally says he stopped, I dont have the energy to care anymore), and smoking weed every single day (he still does this). 

I have cried to him many times about the emotional state of our relationship and how I need him at this time but nothing has changed. There is no intimacy in our relationship, and he only cares about himself and the image of having a girlfriend/baby on the way. He owns his own business and does not have health insurance so he contributes nothing (and has NO plan to) for our daughters health. It will all fall on me. 

Im writing to ask, how do I tell him I want her to have my last name? I am terrified our relationship wont last this way, Ive asked about counseling but of course I would have to pay for it. He gets offended when I ask. But I am doing everything for our child. He just feels we are lucky that we wont have to pay for childcare and that Ill breastfeed to save money on formula. But those are still sacrifices I am making, because I will be a full time employee (and bread winner) who is also taking care of our child. 

If our relationship does turn around and we decide to get married one day, it would be much easier to change her last name than to ever get his permission to change it

2025-03-16,1742124188.0,"My sister wants to plan the baby shower, but is totally dropping the ball. She is now hurt that my mother in law has been planning the whole thing. And she is taking it out on *me*.","My sister and I don't have the best relationship to begin with, which makes this a lot harder. She has narcissistic tendencies and there was a period of time where we didn't speak for almost 6 months. But she is always very insistent on us being family and that she wants to do things for me, and has been absolutely *adamant* about planning my baby shower for me. It just always needs to be on her terms, or she likes having something to threaten me with or dangle over my head (i.e. baby shower). Like, if I upset her in any way, she says ""well I just won't throw your baby shower then."" It's a control thing. This leads to her procrastinating, not getting things done in time, dropping the ball, or just not doing things at all. It's a lifelong pattern.

That being said, I was given advice about this situation in the AITAH subreddit to have someone else help her along or watch her. Hold her accountable essentially. My mother in law is an absolute angel. She and I are very alike, meaning she has been on top of everything. She volunteered to do the whole thing and was very happy to join with my sister when I suggested it. My sister seemed happy with it too. Until my sister just didn't do anything for it.

Fast forward a little bit, at 20 weeks pregnant my MIL said she didn't hear from my sister so she booked the venue and did all the phone calls to actually find a place. My sister did not help.

At 21 weeks pregnant, MIL and I are finding addresses and making spreadsheets to make RSVPs easier. My sister didn't add a single address.

At 21+3 weeks pregnant, my MIL sent my sister and I a message updating about addresses, and she specifically mentioned my sister's name and asked her if she wanted to do the invitations. I didn't hear back from my sister in days and, unsure of she reached out to MIL directly, I texted her myself asking if she said anything. She said she didn't because she's been so busy. Her never-ending excuse for everything she doesn't feel like doing. I said fine whatever. I texted MIL to let her know (kindly) about my sister procrastinating and to let me know if she doesn't hear back.

At 22 weeks pregnant, we see MIL in person, and she is excitedly showing DH and I shower invites she created! They're beautiful and so cute, and she took so much stress off of me in that moment. But fearing my narcissistic sister, I asked if MIL ever heard back from my sister. She said she did not. Of course!! Ugh.

Fast forward to last night 22+2, I talked to my sister to let her know that MIL was planning on moving full speed ahead of she didn't hear back. My sister attempted to give me every excuse in the book, and started saying ""well why didn't she follow up with me then??"" She completely ignored the fact that she did in fact receive MIL's message, AND mine following up. I told her she needs to communicate and that's why MIL is moving forward, because it needs to be done. The shower is still 3 months away but MIL wants to order invites and have family from out of state come, so about 2 months beforehand they will go out. My sister said she was planning on ordering the invitations at the end of April when she finally would have time. I said that is over a month from now! She became very aggressive toward me and said ""Your mother in law just wanted to help and now she's doing the whole thing!""

What she doesn't know is that I've learned to hold my ground.

I told her yes, my MIL is doing the whole thing right now, because you cannot communicate with anyone, you procrastinate, and this has to be done. You can do games or themes or decorations when you ""have time"" later, but I am not doing this with you. There is a baby on the way and he will come on the due date, not when you ""have time."" The shower will be done on the date it is scheduled. Not when you ""have time.""

My husband is aware and is very supportive. I reached out to my MIL to let her know that I spoke with my sister about everything (again leaving out details of arguments and feelings). I told her if she doesn't hear back from my sister before the end of the weekend to move forward with the invitation order.

I'm done sparing feelings for my sister because she doesn't seem to prioritize mine in any way. She hasn't lifted a finger for this shower and lets things go too far before she even starts. Not to mention she is completely broke and can't afford anything. My MIL is an absolute hero and I love her. It just sucks that my sister can't get her shit together long enough to even plan a party. A very important one to shower her first nephew to be.

Thanks for listening. This has been an utter nightmare but I feel a lot better not sparing feelings for someone who doesn't give a crap about mine. I am happy to grow a backbone and stand up for myself and my husband and my baby, and I am thankful to have my amazing MIL on my side.",pregnant,12.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jcjcep/my_sister_wants_to_plan_the_baby_shower_but_is/

2025-03-16,1742093328.0,Hospitalization,"Yesterday and today have been a long day, but yesterday I had made plans to unalive myself. I have been suffering with depression + suicidal ideation for years now, I was on medication that helped me for 9 months before I found out I was pregnant. My prenatal care provider had advised me there isnt enough research on the medication I was on during pregnancy, so she had told me the risks and I had opted out of taking it. Mostly because I had took it once and started bleeding for a few days and we were never able to find out what was the cause of the bleeding but it scared me enough out of taking it.

Dont get me wrong I love my baby, and I choose to keep my baby for that reason. I am about to be 20 weeks tomorrow, Ive been struggling with family issues, losing a friend and problems with my childs father since the beginning of my pregnancy. I slowly felt myself getting pushed to the edge (although I did reach out to my doctor for help and we were trying to make a plan to help me mentally during the pregnancy and put me back in therapy) yesterday somethings happened within my family and I did start to plan to unalive myself. 

I noticed me falling into my suicidal ideation and I took myself to get help at the ER, since my doctor has told me go get help when I need it. I told a few of my friends what happened and Im getting a few your being selfish , you have a baby who is depending on you now but I been asking for help for months from these people.

Im glad I noticed the red flags and went to go get help so I didnt hurt me or baby but right now I just feel like shit, the pressure just got to me.

Update: I am currently in the psych ward department in the ER, I have been since Friday night. I started on Zoloft yesterday 50 mg, and Im feeling okay just nausea.

It was already sad to lose the baby, but to think about that whole experience and see I was just negative the whole time. It's heartbreaking to see myself that way.

This time, I'm about 5 weeks, and I wake up and choose to be excited and LOVE this baby for however long I get to have it. I get to be a MOM! And yes, I know I'm early. I know that stats show I have a 20% of losing this. But I'm hanging on to that 80% that I won't. I am choosing to embrace this season, love deeply, feel connectedness to my womb. And I will tell the people I know who will celebrate this with me, and ignore any judgment. I bought gender neutral onsies a couple of days ago because I wanted to and I'm GLAD I did!

When she asked the name and I told her, she had a visceral reaction to it and was not shy about saying she didn't like it. Lol. 

When she asked to see the ultrasound, she got creeped out by it and said it looks disgusting. Lmao.

The list goes on but I digress. 

The way I've been dealing is to act shocked and say wowww, you're the ONLY person who's said that to me. Then I start telling them about how everyone else in my life is so supportive, loves the name, gushes over the ultrasound. She didn't know how to react =

I think the trick is even though it stings, act as positive as possible and show them that it doesn't affect you. Make THEM out like THEY are the weird ones for being all negative Nancy. Honestly it works a charm. 

Someone says baby doesn't look like you even though baby is a spitting image of you? ""Wowww! That's so interesting you say that, you know, you're the only one who has said that. Everyone else says she looks just like me!"" :)

I'm almost 31 weeks pregnant so the bump is bumping and I found it pretty easy to be confident when I had a hoodie or winter coat on, but now the temperatures are rising to t-shirt levels and I feel so insecure about going outside... Like I'm too exposed...

I know I have a normal pregnant body and I'm happy about my baby but I can't stop stressing about what people will say or think of me. I waited so long for spring to come thinking it would be the end of my struggles but now I'm insecure. 

I know at least 1 person here felt that way at some point so what did you do to feel more confident? Do people often comment on your bump? Do you get stares and such? Are people nicer to you when you're pregnant? Should I just stop caring and enjoy the rest of my pregnancy?

I cant zip my pre pregnancy pants, favorite shirts are now tight around my belly. I genuinely feel like Im going through puberty again. I feel so awkward and uncomfy in my own skin. Getting dressed is so difficult. Im simultaneously excited to see my baby grow but feel embarrassed to be visibly pregnant. 

My parents came into town to visit today. I dont have the best relationship with my mom, its been strained since childhood. (Shes narcissistic and a little emotionally immature). Ive been in therapy for years to heal from abuse and work on maintaining healthy boundaries with my family.

Visit was going good until she reached out to touch my stomach at lunch. I reflexively jumped in my seat and loudly said NO. She looked genuinely confused, THEN asked if she could feel baby. I again said no. I felt like I was going to crawl out of my skin and felt a primal sense of protection? I felt rage.

She then said well I can when you get bigger and baby is kicking. I again said no, I do not want to be touched I dont like being touched. She again repeated that she could. 

I really dont want people touching me other than my husband. This is the first time its happened and now Im so anxious that its just the first time. 

Im an autonomous person with a body that is mine&how do I kindly lay these boundaries when all I feel like doing is screaming? I dont want to overreact but no is no. This is my body and my baby. 

I know a lot of this is my hormones. (A degree is past childhood trauma, Ill check in with my therapist about this in a couple days). A lot of this is learning to be comfortable with my changing body& but did anyone else feel this way? Just awkward and unsure of their body? Not wanting anyone else to touch them?

They have been closely monitoring me since week 20 and i was told early intervention will be needed if necessary, it took me awhile to process this but i was mentally prepared. Our goal was to reach 37 /36 week but not to go beyond that because anything more than that will cause distress to the baby. So yesterday my OB wanted me to get admitted because she didnt want to take any chances also because of my Bp 130/100 and will closely monitor me for IUGR for coming weeks. My Bp looks normal this morning which is funny  and baby is actively moving so I feel stupid now for rushing to the hospital. I was also given steroid shot. I know being around the nurses is the safest for my baby but I really want to make it at least to 36 weeks. My OB told me the baby will come anytime if there is severe growth restriction i know she wants the best for me and the baby but I want to cook it for longer, in 2 days time I will be 34 weeks. So i just need 2 weeks more at least but i am shit scared for nicu if the baby comes early. I wonder if they will ever discharge me or wont let me out until I delivery this baby. 
Sometimes I feel like i am wasting everyones time here since everything looks good as for now. Bp stabilized, heart beat normal and she is moving and I blame my anxiety for agreeing to be admitted, maybe I couldve just waiting for one more week. 
And now I  ranting here thinking whether i did a right thing panicking for no reason. I know its too late now as I am already admitted but just wanted some reassurance here whether i did the right thing. 
Also I would love to hear positive stories of 34 weeker Nicu baby. Because my chances she might be evacuated around 34. 
I dont know what i am looking for now. Reassurance, positive stories, motivation anything that would ease my mind now.

2025-03-16,1742132442.0,At odds with DH weeks before due date&,"I hate that Im even making this post but I need to vent about my relationship. It might be long so thanks if you actually read it. 

I would describe my husband as a pretty stoic, rational man. He doesnt really give in to negative emotions, generally is able to stay on the positive side of things. He is pretty indifferent to small daily stressors, not overwhelmed easily. Pretty even keel. 

Well he dropped a bomb on me the other day that he is really struggling with not feeling important or a priority during the pregnancy. That his feelings are responsible for him not showing me affection and being distant lately. His justification for these feelings are based off a casual conversation we had a month ago where he said he felt like he was on the back burner to which I agreed. I said it sucks but yeah you kind of are, Im the one thats pregnant. The focus needs to be on me and the baby. 

Apparently he had been feeling badly for some time before he brought it up a month ago and said that the conversation just confirmed what he was feeling so he just decided to harbor negative feelings and allow them to change the way he interacted with me. But he let me leave that conversation feeling like things were resolved and led me to believe we were in a good place. 

I feel pretty blindsided. Hes done this before, concealed feelings and let them negatively impact our relationship and then it all kinda blows up. Im due in less than 3 weeks, why did he have to do this now??? 

Anyway idk Im questioning everything. Im feeling like my sacrifices have been all for naught and Ive not been appreciated or acknowledged for anything Ive done. Youd think I was abusive or something toward him or putting all the responsibility on him. I havent been. Ive still been working, taking care of the household, shopping, etc. even though its been such a struggle. I try not to even ask him for things because I feel like a burden. 

Im in so much pain lately and trying to mentally and physically prep for birth and Im getting hit with this crap right now. I mean what was I supposed to do, coddle him this entire time? I just dont really understand it. Im just so tired and dont know where to go from here. I dont even feel like talking to him about it or fighting about it. 

Ironically enough, I had just written him a heartfelt letter and put together a box of all his favorite snacks to give him before the baby is here.. I hadnt even had the chance to give it to him yet before he finally decided to be honest about his feelings. Ugh.

I thought for sure I had GD based on some people saying at 190 they were diagnosed right away without a 3 hour. I got a call from my OB and they asked me to go get the 3hr GTT asap. I did it yesterday and passed all of them!

Fasting (range 65-94) - 81

1 hour (&gt;180) - 171

2 hour (&gt;155) - 141

3 hour (&gt;140) - 94

I just wanted to share as I had trouble finding stories with anyone that was as high as my 1 hour that didnt have GD. 

I have since learned that stress can affect your blood sugar and I was driving all day before my 1 hour for my kids band assessment, dropped my phone in a public toilet, and had a particularly hard time finding a quest location that had appts/walk in time available after their assessment which was the only time Id have to take the test.

And for what its worth (though I know you cant trick your body and should eat how you normally eat before the 1- hour test) prior to my test I had my normal morning coffee, and took my kids for a treat breakfast at McDonalds. My order was a bacon egg and cheese bagel, hash brown we ate about 6 hours before my test. I also had about 1.5 liters of water between breakfast and my test.

Lastly, my experiences during both tests were fine. I had the lemon lime at the 1 hour (tasted like flat sprite) and fruit punch at the 3 hour (tasted like red Kool-Aid, this is the best of the 3 imo, for Fisher Healthcare brands anyway). 

The 3 hour was boring but I had a book, my phone, and some headphones. I was not allowed to leave the lobby during the test. After I was done my husband and kids drove me home which was 1.5 hours away. I was extremely fatigued. At about the 1 hour mark (so 4 hours after drinking the glucose drink) I started feeling really faint, I got really hot, even though I had the air on as low as it would go. My clothes were drenched in sweat and I had trouble breathing. I felt really nauseated and just altogether *not well*. I must have looked pale/sick too bc my husband kept asking if I was okay.

So normally im not one to complain but this is my first baby and ive waited and rescheduled this anatomy scan so many times so my experience really upset me. Also no im not homophobic maybe im wrong but a lot of the stuff im about to right that was said just kind of annoyed me.


So to start it off the appointment was 20 minutes late and my mum had driven hours to come and see the baby and this ultrasound is supposed to be the last one to see the baby before birth and we paid $270. My partner and i were super excited as i had been in hospital a few days prior for reduced movement so just wanted to see our girl. We got into the appointment and the man doing our scan was super entitled, rude to my mum, myself and partner. he breaks part of the equipment before we even start and i just brush it off, he then put the tv screen on where we can see the baby and it doesnt turn on properly, we asked if maybe someone could check it out and he said that this scan wasnt for our entertainment and theres a reason he didnt go into IT, at this point i kind of just wanted to cry. He kept on pressing way to hard and would pull my pants down without even asking me (yes i know sometime they need to go low but its nice to have a little warning instead of someone ripping your pants down). He then asked if we new the gender and i said yes its a girl we are super excited and was talking about her little outfits and he said i prefer not to gender them and colour isnt really a gender thing anyways. At this point i kind of gathered his opinions and views and it really annoyed me how he treated us. i understand everyone is allowed their views but it felt wrong that he kept on shutting down my own opinions and excitement on my own daughter. Finally he tried to take a few of her measurements and couldnt get them, he took the measurements which put her way behind her date instead of rescheduling and kept calling her annoying because she wouldnt move or would suck on her hand or something shed do. i barely got to see her cause the screen was broken.

I cannot sleep for longer than like 3-4 hours at a time before waking up with such bad stomach pain I cant sleep any longer. I called to make a doctors appointment (I had a miscarriage last September) and they told me I was going to have to wait untill Im almost 10 weeks pregnant, which is unfair as last time they seen me at 5 weeks and after miscarriages theyre supposed to see you earlier to make sure everythings okay. I live in a small town in northern canada and have literally no other options (except for a 2 hr drive which I wont be able to make at this rate).

2025-03-16,1742101915.0,I think Im having a miscarriage. Help please,"Hello,

Im going to give a detailed account of my experience. I may share unnecessary information, but thats because I dont know much about pregnancy or miscarriages.

Im 35. This is my first pregnancy. I removed my IUD 6 months ago but only last month my partner and I checked when was my fertile period and then had sex multiple times around that time.

We were very surprised I got pregnant. It felt easy, since it was the first time we really tried.  It felt very unexpected.

I discovered the pregnancy 5 days ago, and that should have been when it was a little less than 4 weeks long.

The miscarriage:
Day 1: 2 days ago I had some very brown discharge, what look exactly like what I get a day before my period. Later that day I got a little more and what looked like some very dark blood. The quantities seem small, not enough to fill a pad, but also seem a bit more than what I read that was normal to happen. I was supposed to be in the implantation phase.

Together with that I felt constant but very mild cramps. No other pains. I tested again to make sure I was pregnant. I had 3 positive tests already.

Day 2: I had very mild cramps also most of the day, and some very brown discharge in the morning. Maybe enough to cover half of a panty protector type of pad, those small ones.

Day 3: I woke up early this morning feeling still really mild cramps. When I went to pee I noticed very little drops of very dark or brown blood, like spotting, on the toilet paper. A couple drops in the toilet water. 

This is the entire situation. This doesnt look good at all, but I also didnt had any red, or mid period like blood coming out. The tiny cramps feel like something is cooking in my uterus, in a bad way. 

I honestly still dont feel like I had a miscarriage, but all the facts point towards the high chance that its already on the way. Mostly because I seem to have had 4x a higher volume of spotting than the usual, and these damn constant, often hard to notice cramps. Sometimes I feel like Im imagining them because I focus so much at that part of my back.

I am okay (as much as one can be) with the possibility of having a first miscarriage. I know how common these are, they happened so much around me already. And Im honestly already so relieved that my partner and I can conceive. My struggle now is not knowing for sure that the pregnancy is gone. Between the first spotting and then several hours without any spotting yesterday, I went from being almost sure it was going to be a loss to hopeful that maybe that was just the implantation symptoms. Maybe I was spotting more than usual because I do get very heavy period the first 2 days of a period.

Anyway, I of course tried to reach out to a doctor on Friday, when this first started, but couldnt get a hold of one. If anyone here lives in the Netherlands, youll know the struggle.

And I know nobody - other than doctors - can really tell me what is happening for sure, but I would still like to kindly ask for anyone who has similar experiences to share any information that you believe may help me.

And to anyone going through a miscarriage, I hope you have the support of people you love. For what I can tell so far, thats the most important. 

Thank you,

2025-03-16,1742127540.0,Worried about my partners mental health (CW loss),"
Im currently 11 weeks pregnant, this is our third pregnancy after a MMC at 13 weeks and a chemical last year. We are now reaching the timeframe we lost our first baby (it passed away at 11.5 weeks). Last week we were told the baby has an enlarged NT which can mean an increased chance of chromosomal abnormalities, were currently (very) anxiously waiting for our NIPT results.

My partner is South African, anyone who knows Afrikaans men will tell you theyre often very traditional and keep to the more classic macho traits. My partner doesnt talk about his feelings - unless hes had a good amount to drink. 

I know my partner struggles with the fact that I obviously feel everything and am so heavily impacted by this pregnancy, he feels kind of on the sideline just waiting to be told how things are going. When I try and talk to him about the pregnancy his response is pretty much always Im sure itll be fine this time. 

On top of that, he doesnt seem that happy with his own stuff. Hes been very demotivated at work for a while. Hes normally very active and also a bit of a thrill seeker, and enjoys a lot of riskier sports. Since our first pregnancy, he quit the riskier stuff, but also hasnt really been enjoying the gym either. He also reads a lot of very negative content online lately and expresses his anger at the state of the world. We currently live in quite a rough area of town, we are moving to the countryside this summer but I know living in this area is also not helping. 

Anyway, over the past few weeks Ive noticed his drinking increase quite a lot. We spoke about it last night and he said he was aware of it, but that he was just so f*cking bored with life at the moment. Obviously with house and baby I was sad to hear this because, although right now life is a little monotonous, we have so much to look forward to. He insisted his feelings were nothing to do with me or our relationship, just the monotony of daily life right now. 

I dont know what to do. He said its not my problem to fix, that he needs to sort himself out. But I cant help but feel really sad about this, on top of the continued pregnancy anxiety, Im really worried about his headspace. Maybe this is how his anxiety comes out, since he doesnt show much emotion in any other capacity. Hes just not the type of person to go speak to someone, so Im not sure how else he can get help.

Baby girl is supposed to be delivered at 37 weeks and Im so paranoid that we wont make it that far. I have a history of preeclampsia and ended up delivering my first baby at 35 weeks. After 50 hours of labor resulting in a c section, and being stuck on bedrest on the mag drip, its safe to say I have slight ptsd from that experience. 

Anyone have any tips for staying calm/relaxed to help keep my BP down? Also does anyone have experience with procardia vs Labetalol? I feel like I need to switch to Labetalol or add a dose in on top of my procardia.

My baby is 10 months old and I just found out I'm pregnant again (this was wanted and we're so excited). 

My boy is a massive 99th percentile and has always loved food whether it's boob or solids. Even before I got pregnant, the daily feeds were starting to get hard. He's got 8 teeth and he would suck a little then just bite me - never seemed interested in actually having a decent feed. I would always offer before then giving him solids. The first feed when he wakes up for the day has remained really good. 

I've been pumping heaps to try and maintain supply in case he wants to come back to it more during the day but if I'm honest, it's starting to feel pointless. 

Now I'm pregnant again. I'm tired. I have stuff I want to accomplish before baby number 2 and wasting the time to pump when I'm barely getting anything anymore just feels... pointless? 

He likes formula and I know there's nothing wrong with it but I always had it in my mind he wouldn't need formula and I would feed him until at least a year but idk how achievable that goal is now. 

Being pregnant again I'm just so freaking tired and part of me feels like I should give my body a break. I will keep up with the morning feeds as long as he lets me cos another huge part is not ready for this journey to end with him. :(

Ive been steadfast in my decision from the start so I havent been emotional really throughout this process, Im just feeling relieved as I type this. Here is my experience with the medication for anyone whos worried!

Last night around 7pm I took the step 1 pill (mifepristone) by mouth and had no side effects. 

I woke up this morning with my usual morning sickness and then i had my morning coffee and doom scrolled tiktok for a few hours before getting ready to take step 2. I prepped by setting up my bed with my heating pad and a towel to protect my mattress, love island on the tv, snacks, meds within reach and water. I live alone so was alone for the process but kept my best friend updated throughout the day. Heres how my day today went:

11:30: clonazepam x1, ate toast and jam

12:00: Tylenol 3 x2
Naproxen x1

12:25 800 mg misoprostol vaginally

1:05- severe cramps, nausea, light headed, shaky, lasted 15 min

1:15 clonazepam x1

2:00 ate chicken nuggies &amp; smoothie

2:45 mild cramping &amp; heavy bleeding begins (small clot)

3:20 cramping getting worse 

3:45 2 large clots, lots of blood in toilet when went to go pee

4:20 2 more large clots, cramps getting worse again
 
4:25 Tylenol 3 x2

5:00-7:45 nap time. mild- mod cramping

7:45- Carrie scene while walking to bathroom after nap. One more large clot. Straight into shower. 

8:00- all cleaned up, mild cramping, still heavily bleeding

9:00- eat late supper, feeling mostly normal, very mild cramping, moderate-heavy bleeding

Honestly, the worst part was the really bad cramps around 1pm. Passed like 5 med-large clots altogether and used maybe 7 pads over the course of the day. Dont be afraid if you are!

2025-03-16,1742147691.0,Medication Abortion - Positive Experience,"Hi all, 25F here, US/North Carolina. I was absolutely terrified to go through with my MA this weekend so I wanted to share my experience in case it helps someone else. 

Some background, I was 5-6 weeks pregnant for my abortion and I am prone to extremely bad menstrual cramps for my normal period, which made me really scared to go through with the misoprostol. In North Carolina, you have to go through a consent appointment 72 hours prior to the abortion, so I did that at a local clinic. It was a bizarre experience where I had an ultrasound, light bloodwork, and counseling (if you can even call it that). 

On Friday I took the mifepristone at the clinic in a room of like 6 other women. I had little to no side effects from the mifepristone, other than emotional effects. I took Naproxen instead of Ibuprofen because it works much better for me, so I started that on Friday. Yesterday I took two rounds of misoprostol (8 pills total). Dissolving them in my mouth was definitely unpleasant but not a huge deal, made my gums kind of sore after. I started cramping within 20-30 minutes and started bleeding about an hour after starting the pills. I took Naproxen an hour before starting the first round and Zofran right before. I prepped with period underwear (dont skip out on this part!) and overnight pads. I had 2 heating pads, one that wraps around my back and one for the front. 

Like I mentioned, my menstrual cramps are horrific normally (Ive taken toradol injections at urgent care for the pain before) and my periods are very heavy (8 days long) so I was worried my abortion pain would be proportional to that, but luckily with the Naproxen and heating pads, it was comparable to a bad period for me. You should definitely prepare to be as sedentary as possible (I found that moving around made the cramps and nausea worse). If you can have someone with you to support you and get anything you need, its a huge help. 

I passed the pregnancy about 4 hours after the first round which is about when I started the second round of misoprostol. I made sure to eat something and drink electrolyte drinks before the second round because the nausea and stomach cramps were pretty bad. I had some diarrhea as well. By the second round of misoprostol, I had already passed the largest clots and it was just a lot of bleeding by that point. I used about 5-6 overnight pads the first night. Make sure you have a heating pad with an automatic timer/shut off so you can go to sleep with it on. I made sure to take another Naproxen before I went to bed at about midnight. Unfortunately, for some reason 12am-3am was kind of the worst of the pain for me, idk if it was the stomach cramps and nausea or what but that was the hardest part, but still not the worst pain Ive ever experienced. By the time I woke up in the morning, the worst of it was over and I didnt need any pain meds anymore. Im still having mild cramping today but overall it had not been NEARLY as bad as I expected. I expected to be crying all night from the pain, but I never got to that point. Here are the items I found most helpful:
- Period underwear
- Thick overnight pads
- Electrolyte drinks (hydration will help your nausea) 
- Wrap around heating pad with automatic shut off timer
- Zofran/anti nausea medication and pain medication that works best for you
- Popsicles and Italian ices (the cold helped my nausea)
- Applesauce and rice (to be able to take the meds) 
- All the distraction items you might need. Video games, books, movies chosen beforehand, etc. 

My DMs are open if anyone has questions about my experience or needs to vent. This was one of the hardest things Ive ever had to go through so Im happy to help you through it.

2025-03-16,1742130618.0,Cramping on left side 3 weeks after medical abortion,"Hey guys, I need some advice. About 3 weeks ago I had a medical abortion at 6 weeks pregnant. I ordered the pills online, it's my second abortion so I didn't go to a doctor, also just for the simple fact that I have state insurance and it's very hard to find a provider around me that covers the cost of an abortion.

But for the last 2 days, I have had cramping that is specifically on my left side. It radiates to my hip and I can feel it in my leg, butt and back as well. It feels just a tad bit more intense than my normal period cramps but nothing crazy. My bleeding has started lightening up over the past day or 2, but this cramping has just been so consistent over the past 2 days that I'm starting to worry. Last night I decided to take a pregnancy test just to make sure that my hcg levels were going down, but it still came back very positive.

I can say that I did see the sac come out when I had my abortion, so I know that my body dispelled SOMETHING. All of my bleeding was normal and everything had passed. I guess I'm just concerned about a potential ectopic pregnancy? I've never experienced one so I'm not sure what that pain would feel like. The cramping just feels very odd, especially for how directed it is in my left side and it's not just a general cramping feeling in my uterus.

Just figured i'd post on here and ask if anyone has experienced anything like this before taking myself over to the ER to get an ultrasound done....",abortion,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jcl3oj/cramping_on_left_side_3_weeks_after_medical/
2025-03-16,1742146227.0,SA with no Sedation - Positive Experience,"This was not my first abortion, but it was my first surgical. I opted to not do medical this time as I have health anxiety (and GAD), so I disliked the self-regulating aspect of the MA. I also liked the idea of it being over in 10 minutes vs the MAs 10+ hours. I chose to do no sedation honestly because the idea of even partial sedation kind of freaks me out. I liked the idea of being somewhat in control, and I felt like I wouldnt have that with sedation. This is just me though and my weird health anxiety brain. 

Before the procedure: The day of the procedure, my bf and I went to the clinic around 1:15 (apt was 1:30). I was taken for a vaginal ultrasound around 1:45 and they said I was 5wks3days.  Then, I was given an antibiotic and my bp was taken. I then had to wait for the Dr to arrive for about 45 more minutes. 

I was moved to the room and told to undress from the waist down and put a pad in my underwear (for after). I was hoping they would give me an ibuprofen or something before the procedure, but they didnt. Then, I laid down and waited for the nurse to come and set up the instruments. She did and then the other nurses and Dr came in. They were all very chatty and friendly. We kept talking about my decision to not have the sedation: they were telling me that if at any point I changed my mind, we could do it, but I didnt feel pressured at all. I feel like I have a decent pain tolerance after having a chronic ankle injury and heavy periods with a lot of cramps. I was less worried about the pain since it wouldnt last for that long, I was more just nervous/anxious about the whole thing. 

The procedure: At first, the Dr. examined me to check the placement of my cervix (I think). Then, he put in the speculum, and it was cold and honestly kinda pinched, but it didnt hurt really. Then, he gave me the lidocaine injections to my cervix, and they didnt really hurt. I remember them all asking and I said, I just kinda feel my cervix, and they laughed and said that was a good sign. Then, he started with the dilation rod and that hurt! It wasnt 10/10 pain but definitely uncomfortable pain that caused me to kind of kick my legs a little (lol). It definitely hurt every time it happened - it happened maybe 5 times during the procedure and almost felt like he was just moving something around in there. It was maybe 8-9/10 pain but only lasted for 5-10 seconds each time. I just closed my eyes and breathed while trying not to tense up, although I definitely made faces (not really noises other than comments like oh ouch or yeah that kind of hurts). The suction didnt really feel like anything, it was a little uncomfortable and maybe a little painful (2/10) but not as bad as my normal period cramps and not nearly as bad as the other feeling I described above. The whole thing last probably 5-7 minutes and the part after the lidocaine shots (which felt like the real beginning) lasted only about 2-3 minutes. I didnt see anything that came out as I was either looking at the ceiling, had my eyes closed, or was talking to one of the nurses next to my head. During the procedure they also were checking my uterus with an ultrasound on my abdomen, but that I kind of just zoned out and forgot that was happening. They pulled all of the stuff out and it was definitely relieving, not painful at all. It really just felt like I could relax everything down there finally. Then, they said good job and left other than one of the nurses. She brought me my underwear and pants and put them on for me (this part was so awkward lol). I think its the normal procedure if someone gets sedation, but I feel like I could have just done it myself& it was just so awkward lol. I ended up just asking to do it myself and she let me.

After: I felt weak and was cramping a lot after. Other stories I read said that once the procedure was done, all the pain went away, but that wasnt the case for me. I had pretty bad cramps for maybe 5 minutes. Then, they lessened to mild cramps. They had me sit in an inside waiting room and took my blood pressure twice. They gave me a pack of crackers and water, which I took, and also offered an ibuprofen that I declined. I sat there for probably 20 minutes total and then they said I could leave. In total, I was there from 1:15-3:00. 

Now, as Im writing this it had been about 22 hours and the cramping has become almost none. I had mild cramps for maybe an hour after, but I took naproxen and havent had any since. I did wake up nauseous today, which I didnt have during the pregnancy, but it went away fairly quickly. 

Overall, I would probably do the same route again, without the sedation and all, but I would take a naproxen before the procedure since all I had was the lidocaine.

I asked him why he had previously told me he loved me and he said, that he didnt know why but that we would be alright. 

I know that he has a visa that limits him on the type of companies that will sponsor him, which is something he complains about everytime we speak. I am scared he is going to use our child to get a family visa.

I also have an underlying condition which could cause me to have a difficult pregnancy and having to go through all that by myself, will be difficult.

i have not bled but only been passing tissue since the MA, and i was able to get them to do an ultrasound when i went to the ER for the concussion. they consulted with my OB/GYN and i have 1.3cm thick tissue on my endometrium retained from the pregnancy. i was given the option of waiting to see if it passes with subsequent periods, but im terrified of retained tissue leading to future pregnancy complications. tried misoprostol again for the tissue and absolutely nothing happened, so they scheduled me for D+E later this week. i am so tired and just want to get to the point where i can cope with the grief and depression and work towards having my life back. 

i made the decision to have the procedure because of this, but im also really do not want to have to go through another traumatic medical experience, especially without support. i have read a lot of others stories about waiting for this tissue to pass for months without any luck. is going through with the D+E worth it? should i wait? please feel free to share experiences in either direction, hope everyone is getting by out there d",abortion,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jcbhj1/rpoc_2_weeks_after_ma_at_105_weeks_de/

2025-03-16,1742107819.0,Pmdd post abortion : TN USA,"  In August, I had an abortion. 

Before this happened, I had never been on birth control before and I did not feel that I suffered from mood swings surrounding my period. Id have one random cry every month and know it must mean my period was coming. =

Flash forward to September, I got a copper IUD. And immediately felt insanely emotional. Crying spells daily and PMDD that was debilitating. My poor partner, I was an absolute menace. Ive never experienced anger and sadness quite like the six months I had the IUD. 

After things hit a breaking point and I didnt feel my body was adjusting, I got the IUD removed and switched to YAZ. Which is the only birth control Ive found that is supposed to help with PMDD. 

I am three weeks into yaz and while I feel better, I do NOT feel as good as I did pre pregnancy. The week before my period still feels like hell. I am irritable, angry, and cannot stop crying. Ive never experienced PMS like this pre pregnancy. 

Is this a normal response post abortion? Will this get better with time? Is there anything I can do to make the week before my period not absolute hell for everyone involved? ",abortion,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jcfozs/pmdd_post_abortion_tn_usa/

2025-03-15,1742070086.0,"Do Women Have a Moral Duty to Keep Their Bodies ""Ready"" for Reproduction at All Times?","Late last year, Dr. Rebecca Gomperts (Aid Access, Women on Waves) announced results of a large clinical trial in Moldova, testing the use of a weekly low dose of mifepristone (50 mg) as a contraceptive. The results were promising, with only one pregnancy occurring within 2000 cycles. Furthermore, negative side effects were minimal, with only 4% of the participants experiencing any negative side effects (compared to a 40% negative side effect rate for conventional hormonal contraceptives). Additionally, the low-dose mifepristone was easier to use, requiring only one dose a week, and being more ""forgiving"" of variations in the time the pill is taken. And 89% of the study participants reported that they stopped menstruating while taking mifepristone as a contraceptive. (Probably most women would consider this a positive side effect.)

Because of the positive results, the trials have been expanded to the Netherlands this year. If the results continue to be positive, the plan is to apply to the European Medicines Agency for registration and market authorization to allow this weekly, low-dose mifepristone regimen as a contraceptive throughout the EU.

The method of action for mifepristone as birth control is two-fold: it reduces the rate of ovulation and it thins the endometrial lining of the uterus, making it impossible for a fertilized egg to implant.

([Source](https://msmagazine.com/2025/01/07/mifepristone-weekly-contraceptive-clinical-trials-abortion-pill-birth-control/).)

My primary question for PL supporters is this: 

* Would you have any moral or legal objections to women's use of such a contraceptive? If so, on what grounds?

Here are some secondary questions if you believe that the use of this contraceptive would be immoral:

* If a woman was taking mifepristone as described here *as a contraceptive* and informed her partner that she was doing this before they had sex, and if her partner, knowing this, decided to go ahead and have PIV sex with her, and if one of his sperm fertilized an egg but it failed to implant, whose would be the primary responsibility for the ""death"" of the fertilized egg? (Realistically, neither of them would ever know if this happened, so this is a hypothetical question.)
* *Men's* use of tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, red meat, and food high in trans fats during the months before their partners' conception is associated with higher miscarriage rates, because of these substances' impacts on sperm. ([Source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/a-mans-unhealthy-lifestyle-too-can-lead-to-his-partners-pregnancy-loss/articleshow/64072130.cms?from=mdr).)  If men engage in such unhealthy lifestyles, they are not maintaining their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction, and their choices could result in the ""death"" of a fertilized egg or even an embryo or fetus. Do they have a moral duty to maintain their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction by refraining from such lifestyle choices?",Abortiondebate,56.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jc47ep/do_women_have_a_moral_duty_to_keep_their_bodies/
2025-03-16,1742136839.0,Abortion is Absolutely Justified,"Premises:

1. Moral worth is based on current capacity for sentience, as **only sentient beings can experience harm**.

2. A pre-sentient fetus **lacks the ability to experience harm** and has no present interests.

3. Forcing a sentient person to remain pregnant **imposes significant physical, psychological, and emotional harm**.

4. Future potential does not create present moral worth; moral status depends on actual characteristics, **not hypothetical ones**.

5. When a **moral conflict** arises, the entity capable of experiencing harm (the pregnant person) has **greater moral weight** than a non-sentient fetus.

Conclusion:

Before fetal sentience, abortion is morally justified because **there is no meaningful harm to the fetus**, while forcing pregnancy **significantly harms a sentient person**.

We unexpectedly got pregnant and found out in August of last year. Once we found out, my entire world changed. I obviously stopped drinking, vaping, caffeine, everything to ensure I had a healthy, safe pregnancy (which thankfully I have). My boyfriend struggled with the change. For months, I found him sneaking alcohol behind my back, hiding drinking from me, and being completely irresponsible.

I have a full time job that I have been at for 3 years with great benefits (including the health insurance that has gotten us 100% through this pregnancy). I work from home and have the ability to keep my daughter home with me once she is born, and 3 months of paid maternity leave. I put money in savings every month and only have a car payment/mortgage. So in my mind, and what we agreed to before, was if I got pregnant we would keep the baby. 

Over the last 8 months, our relationship has really struggled. He has not been supportive or helped me in any way. I have purchased everything for the baby (almost $4,000 worth), paid for our maternity photos, scheduled all the doctors appointments, cooked my own meals, did the nursery alone. All while he was drinking (which he finally says he stopped, I dont have the energy to care anymore), and smoking weed every single day (he still does this). 

I have cried to him many times about the emotional state of our relationship and how I need him at this time but nothing has changed. There is no intimacy in our relationship, and he only cares about himself and the image of having a girlfriend/baby on the way. He owns his own business and does not have health insurance so he contributes nothing (and has NO plan to) for our daughters health. It will all fall on me. 

Im writing to ask, how do I tell him I want her to have my last name? I am terrified our relationship wont last this way, Ive asked about counseling but of course I would have to pay for it. He gets offended when I ask. But I am doing everything for our child. He just feels we are lucky that we wont have to pay for childcare and that Ill breastfeed to save money on formula. But those are still sacrifices I am making, because I will be a full time employee (and bread winner) who is also taking care of our child. 

If our relationship does turn around and we decide to get married one day, it would be much easier to change her last name than to ever get his permission to change it

2025-03-16,1742093328.0,Hospitalization,"Yesterday and today have been a long day, but yesterday I had made plans to unalive myself. I have been suffering with depression + suicidal ideation for years now, I was on medication that helped me for 9 months before I found out I was pregnant. My prenatal care provider had advised me there isnt enough research on the medication I was on during pregnancy, so she had told me the risks and I had opted out of taking it. Mostly because I had took it once and started bleeding for a few days and we were never able to find out what was the cause of the bleeding but it scared me enough out of taking it.

Dont get me wrong I love my baby, and I choose to keep my baby for that reason. I am about to be 20 weeks tomorrow, Ive been struggling with family issues, losing a friend and problems with my childs father since the beginning of my pregnancy. I slowly felt myself getting pushed to the edge (although I did reach out to my doctor for help and we were trying to make a plan to help me mentally during the pregnancy and put me back in therapy) yesterday somethings happened within my family and I did start to plan to unalive myself. 

I noticed me falling into my suicidal ideation and I took myself to get help at the ER, since my doctor has told me go get help when I need it. I told a few of my friends what happened and Im getting a few your being selfish , you have a baby who is depending on you now but I been asking for help for months from these people. Especially my childs father and people didnt take my cries for help serious, until now. 

Im glad I noticed the red flags and went to go get help so I didnt hurt me or baby but right now I just feel like shit, the pressure just got to me.

Update: I am currently in the psych ward department in the ER, I have been since Friday night. I started on Zoloft yesterday 50 mg, and Im feeling okay just nausea. The plan is to put me in a in patient psych ward and I dont know how I feel about that, but I guess its what they believe is best for me and baby.

Now that Im nearing 30 weeks, all these emotions are bubbling up, and I dont know how to tackle it.

For context, my husband is a sailor and is away from home 6-7 months a year, when we found out about the pregnancy, we planned his departure such that he was with me for most of this first trimester and would return around the last month, however his dad passed away in the middle of this and he had to (of course) come back. That kind of changed the entire course of things and now hes only due to be back a month or two post the babys birth. 

I still have a village to support me, my parents, his mom, siblings, extended family, great friends and a trusted healthcare system but I still feel sad that he wont be here to experience and see me give birth.

2025-03-16,1742147581.0,I'm choosing to stat positive and excited every day,"I had a chemical pregnancy back in October, and pretty much knew I was pregnant for about a week. That whole time, I was just anxious and my every thought was ""don't be excited because you could lose it"" sure enough, I did. But man I wish I had just let myself experience the joy of finding out I was pregnant. It was already sad to lose the baby, but to think about that whole experience and see I was just negative the whole time. It's heartbreaking to see myself that way. I have always wanted to be a mother, and I thought I was guarding my heart. But I was denying myself the joy of motherhood, even if it was just for a week. 

This time, I'm about 5 weeks, and I wake up and choose to be excited and LOVE this baby for however long I get to have it. I get to be a MOM! And yes, I know I'm early. I know that stats show I have a 20% of losing this. But I'm hanging on to that 80% that I won't. I am choosing to embrace this season, love deeply, feel connectedness to my womb. And I will tell the people I know who will celebrate this with me, and ignore any judgment. I bought gender neutral onsies a couple of days ago because I wanted to and I'm GLAD I did! This baby is so loved, and I am optimistic I will meet them someday. But if I don't, then I'll know that I allowed myself to experience this pregnancy authentically me. I will mourn my loss, I will be heartbroken, but I'll know the motherly love I have was given the space it needed during this time.

I just needed to rant. I feel like I see so many ""I hate to be a Debbie downer BUT..."" comments on many early excited pregnancy posts, and I just wanted to be the positive voice. We are all scared, we are all anxious, and we all know the odds!!! We know the worst case scenario! But I refuse to let that energy into this pregnancy.

Getting dressed is so difficult. Im simultaneously excited to see my baby grow but feel embarrassed to be visibly pregnant. 

My parents came into town to visit today. I dont have the best relationship with my mom, its been strained since childhood. (Shes narcissistic and a little emotionally immature). Ive been in therapy for years to heal from abuse and work on maintaining healthy boundaries with my family.

Visit was going good until she reached out to touch my stomach at lunch. I reflexively jumped in my seat and loudly said NO. She looked genuinely confused, THEN asked if she could feel baby. I again said no. I felt like I was going to crawl out of my skin and felt a primal sense of protection? I felt rage.

She then said well I can when you get bigger and baby is kicking. I again said no, I do not want to be touched I dont like being touched. She again repeated that she could. 

I really dont want people touching me other than my husband. This is the first time its happened and now Im so anxious that its just the first time. 

Im an autonomous person with a body that is mine&how do I kindly lay these boundaries when all I feel like doing is screaming? I dont want to overreact but no is no. This is my body and my baby. 

I know a lot of this is my hormones. (A degree is past childhood trauma, Ill check in with my therapist about this in a couple days).

I would describe my husband as a pretty stoic, rational man. He doesnt really give in to negative emotions, generally is able to stay on the positive side of things. He is pretty indifferent to small daily stressors, not overwhelmed easily. Pretty even keel. 

Well he dropped a bomb on me the other day that he is really struggling with not feeling important or a priority during the pregnancy. That his feelings are responsible for him not showing me affection and being distant lately. His justification for these feelings are based off a casual conversation we had a month ago where he said he felt like he was on the back burner to which I agreed. I said it sucks but yeah you kind of are, Im the one thats pregnant. The focus needs to be on me and the baby. 

Apparently he had been feeling badly for some time before he brought it up a month ago and said that the conversation just confirmed what he was feeling so he just decided to harbor negative feelings and allow them to change the way he interacted with me. But he let me leave that conversation feeling like things were resolved and led me to believe we were in a good place. 

I feel pretty blindsided. Hes done this before, concealed feelings and let them negatively impact our relationship and then it all kinda blows up. Im due in less than 3 weeks, why did he have to do this now??? 

Anyway idk Im questioning everything. Im feeling like my sacrifices have been all for naught and Ive not been appreciated or acknowledged for anything Ive done. Youd think I was abusive or something toward him or putting all the responsibility on him. I havent been. Ive still been working, taking care of the household, shopping, etc. even though its been such a struggle. I try not to even ask him for things because I feel like a burden. 

Im in so much pain lately and trying to mentally and physically prep for birth and Im getting hit with this crap right now. I mean what was I supposed to do, coddle him this entire time? I just dont really understand it. Im just so tired and dont know where to go from here. I dont even feel like talking to him about it or fighting about it. 

Ironically enough, I had just written him a heartfelt letter and put together a box of all his favorite snacks to give him before the baby is here.. I hadnt even had the chance to give it to him yet before he finally decided to be honest about his feelings. Ugh.

I am getting through week 18 and out of the blue I started getting rashes after touching my dog. Specifically after she spends time leaning onto me (fur touching my arm or leg skin). 
My arm or thigh will get all red with bumps (looks exactly like an allergic reaction). This will not happened if I only touch her with the palms of my hand. 

I have lived with my pup for over 15 years and have never had any reactions to her. She gets bathed regularly and nothing has changed in how i take care of her. 
Could this be a pregnancy thing? Has this happened to any of you? Did you develop any weird new allergies while pregnant? Did they go away?

2025-03-16,1742101915.0,I think Im having a miscarriage. Help please,"Hello,

Im going to give a detailed account of my experience. I may share unnecessary information, but thats because I dont know much about pregnancy or miscarriages.

Im 35. This is my first pregnancy. I removed my IUD 6 months ago but only last month my partner and I checked when was my fertile period and then had sex multiple times around that time.

We were very surprised I got pregnant. It felt easy, since it was the first time we really tried.  It felt very unexpected.

I discovered the pregnancy 5 days ago, and that should have been when it was a little less than 4 weeks long.

The miscarriage:
Day 1: 2 days ago I had some very brown discharge, what look exactly like what I get a day before my period. Later that day I got a little more and what looked like some very dark blood. The quantities seem small, not enough to fill a pad, but also seem a bit more than what I read that was normal to happen. I was supposed to be in the implantation phase.

Together with that I felt constant but very mild cramps. No other pains. I tested again to make sure I was pregnant. I had 3 positive tests already.

Day 2: I had very mild cramps also most of the day, and some very brown discharge in the morning. Maybe enough to cover half of a panty protector type of pad, those small ones.

Day 3: I woke up early this morning feeling still really mild cramps. When I went to pee I noticed very little drops of very dark or brown blood, like spotting, on the toilet paper. A couple drops in the toilet water. 

This is the entire situation. This doesnt look good at all, but I also didnt had any red, or mid period like blood coming out. The tiny cramps feel like something is cooking in my uterus, in a bad way. 

I honestly still dont feel like I had a miscarriage, but all the facts point towards the high chance that its already on the way. Mostly because I seem to have had 4x a higher volume of spotting than the usual, and these damn constant, often hard to notice cramps. Sometimes I feel like Im imagining them because I focus so much at that part of my back.

I am okay (as much as one can be) with the possibility of having a first miscarriage. I know how common these are, they happened so much around me already. And Im honestly already so relieved that my partner and I can conceive. My struggle now is not knowing for sure that the pregnancy is gone. Between the first spotting and then several hours without any spotting yesterday, I went from being almost sure it was going to be a loss to hopeful that maybe that was just the implantation symptoms. Maybe I was spotting more than usual because I do get very heavy period the first 2 days of a period.

Anyway, I of course tried to reach out to a doctor on Friday, when this first started, but couldnt get a hold of one. If anyone here lives in the Netherlands, youll know the struggle.

And I know nobody - other than doctors - can really tell me what is happening for sure, but I would still like to kindly ask for anyone who has similar experiences to share any information that you believe may help me.

And to anyone going through a miscarriage, I hope you have the support of people you love. For what I can tell so far, thats the most important.

2025-03-16,1742127540.0,Worried about my partners mental health (CW loss),"
Im currently 11 weeks pregnant, this is our third pregnancy after a MMC at 13 weeks and a chemical last year. We are now reaching the timeframe we lost our first baby (it passed away at 11.5 weeks). Last week we were told the baby has an enlarged NT which can mean an increased chance of chromosomal abnormalities, were currently (very) anxiously waiting for our NIPT results.

My partner is South African, anyone who knows Afrikaans men will tell you theyre often very traditional and keep to the more classic macho traits. My partner doesnt talk about his feelings - unless hes had a good amount to drink. 

I know my partner struggles with the fact that I obviously feel everything and am so heavily impacted by this pregnancy, he feels kind of on the sideline just waiting to be told how things are going. When I try and talk to him about the pregnancy his response is pretty much always Im sure itll be fine this time. 

On top of that, he doesnt seem that happy with his own stuff. Hes been very demotivated at work for a while. Hes normally very active and also a bit of a thrill seeker, and enjoys a lot of riskier sports. Since our first pregnancy, he quit the riskier stuff, but also hasnt really been enjoying the gym either. He also reads a lot of very negative content online lately and expresses his anger at the state of the world. We currently live in quite a rough area of town, we are moving to the countryside this summer but I know living in this area is also not helping. 

Anyway, over the past few weeks Ive noticed his drinking increase quite a lot. We spoke about it last night and he said he was aware of it, but that he was just so f*cking bored with life at the moment. Obviously with house and baby I was sad to hear this because, although right now life is a little monotonous, we have so much to look forward to. He insisted his feelings were nothing to do with me or our relationship, just the monotony of daily life right now. 

I dont know what to do. He said its not my problem to fix, that he needs to sort himself out. But I cant help but feel really sad about this, on top of the continued pregnancy anxiety, Im really worried about his headspace. Maybe this is how his anxiety comes out, since he doesnt show much emotion in any other capacity. Hes just not the type of person to go speak to someone, so Im not sure how else he can get help.

I'm currently 10w3d and experienced severe nausea and vomiting since about 5 weeks (6 weeks on the dot with the vomiting). I was given Reglan that improved it for a couple days before doing nothing at all besides give me shakiness in my muscles, so I stopped. I got to the point of throwing up about 3-5 times a day and always after a solid meal, went to the ER at 8 weeks because severe dehydration was causing my back and ab muscles to cramp so bad I legitimately thought I had an ectopic (I was also spotting a bit prior), they confirmed baby was progressing as expected with a strong heartbeat and textbook structure/size. They gave me a few days worth of Zofran but my doctor refused to refill because he hadn't seen me yet. Regardless, Zofran was effective for only most of those days but did not stop the puking altogether and the last day I had it, it felt like it did nothing. The nausea was getting worse so out of pure desperation I took the Reglan again and dealt with the unwanted symptoms.

I want to say my nausea peaked (so far) last Wednesday night, I threw up/dry heaved 9 times that day, had an absolute delirious mental episode and considered going to the ER before I eventually just passed out on my bed. Thursday hitting the 10 week mark, I felt *slightly* better but still puking. Friday, puked 3 times. Yesterday once, all acid though, but more bone tired than usual like it was a trade off- first time having solid food since Wednesday.  I never stopped actually being nauseous all day even throughout this. 

This morning my nausea resembled more hunger pains than an actual urge to puke. I feel far more lucid. I don't want to jinx myself, I've been fooled before, but I am at the moment feeling 80% more ""normal."" I've been warned about sudden ends to symptoms as something potentially bad, especially since I read that most people reach their peak nausea symptoms around 10 weeks *if* it's a first trimester thing only, and lasting until 12-14 weeks. 

I guess I'm just looking for a peace of mind. I'm not even sure if I should really call my current symptoms progression as a gradual improvement since the nausea never wavered until literally just this morning. I'm holding on the hope that my boobs are still sore and I'm still sluggish that maybe this is actually a good sign and not something to be concerned about.

I get my first scan Thursday so I really won't know anything until then.

2025-03-16,1742122461.0,Spotting due to medication or a pregnancy,"Spotting due to medication or potential pregnancy

Hi all,

I am 40 and my wife is 36.

We have an 8 year old and my wife got an IUD fitted 7.5 years back.

Also, we had been having unprotected sex since then.

She has a regular 28 day cycle (had never missed any except for during her first pregnancy earlier) and had a last due date on March 6th.

We consulted a gynaec and did a pregnancy check with an hcg test on the 9th (3 days from her due date that came out negative).

But there was a confusion as she had experienced some sensitivity and increase in her size of her breasts (from the 3rd day onwards).

She was prescribed deviry 10 mg to resume her menses for 5 days.

It was the 5th and last day of the medication yesterday and she has observed a bit of spotting day before yesterday and today.

If the spotting is considered a side effect of deviry (and that her regular periods can be expected anytime within the next 7-10 days), is there a possibility that she is still pregnant if the periods do not resume in this scenario.

Please share your opinions.

2025-03-16,1742122119.0,Emotional Rollercoaster,"**TLDR:** ***Ive had a lot of physical, emotional, and mentally challenging issues during my pregnancy; and really need some advice or reassurance. If you can share anything, please do. Im sorry its so long, I tried to trim everything down but theres just so much.***

My pregnancy has been more of an emotional rollercoaster than I even thought it could be. Im currently due June 2nd, and Im not sure what all to expect with the last couple months. 

In the first half of my pregnancy, I was diagnosed with HG and was throwing up constantly and unable to keep food or medication down, resulting in me losing around thirty pounds within the first trimester. It was incredibly hard for me and my husband. If I hadnt known I was pregnant I wouldve thought I had cancer or some serious illness. 

We were waiting to tell our families in person, but we live out of state. Just before we went to see them we had our first ultrasound, and got to see the baby for the very first time. It was incredible, and breathtaking. It made it all feel so worth it. I was so glad to see my sickness wasnt effecting him like I was worried it was. 

We finally got to tell our families we were pregnant around week 14, for Thanksgiving. It was absolutely beautiful, and something Ill remember the rest of my life.

Immediately following Thanksgiving, I got incredibly sick, on top of my HG situation. Some sort of respiratory sickness they couldnt put a name on, and couldnt give me medication for at first. For one week, I really thought I was going to die I was so ill. On top of the HG, I couldnt breathe, had severe chest pains that I even went to the ER for because I got so scared, was coughing so hard it made me cry and vomit. It was so painful. I had a mental breakdown, and truly thought the baby might not make it. They ended up finally giving me medication to help at least a little. It took another week to feel like it was getting better.

I was able to get a couple of days at work that week. I had been missing most days of work for two months. I came home on December 12th, and my beloved kitty got her wings that night. It was my first true loss, and it was really hard. 

That next week we found out that we are having a boy, and getting to share the news with family and my husband is something I will cherish forever. It was so wonderful. 

Over Christmas, my HG finally seemed to be letting up. It was amazing. I ate food for the first time in months that wasnt rice or bread. We stayed home instead of seeing family because it had made me so so sick last time, and to spend time with our other pets. It was beautiful, and it even snowed a tiny bit.

Come new years, my HG was back, but my belly was starting to show and we had gotten to see him on ultrasound again. I tried to push through and make it to work. My boss pulled me aside and told me that I whod been missing too much, even with everything going on. That they understood, but if I missed or called out one more day within 8 weeks they would take me to part time and cut my benefits. They acted like I was just staying home because I wanted to and not because I was horribly sick. We were running out of our savings, it wasnt like I didnt need to be there, I couldnt. Adding an entire new stress to my situation. 

We get our 20 week anatomy scan mid January. They were unable to see his face, with his arms up, and needed to get another scan soon to try to check for cleft. They are unable to see his heart fully. They tell me they also saw what may be a tumor is his brain, and will check it again next time. At this point theyve been taking blood and urine samples every time I come in. My white blood cell count is double what it should be and had been that way since I got sick at Thanksgiving. They let me know they are sending me to a specialist but not to worry. I am definitely worried for my little guy.

They schedule me a few more weeks out for another ultrasound. I try to make it to work, as Im in fear of losing my benefits so close to birth. Im throwing up multiple times a day and having to leave my desk constantly. Theyre upset Im not able to grab someone to cover the desk on my way to run to the restroom to vomit. Theyre upset I seem sick, tired, and on the verge of tears at the front desk. Not a good look for them. Exactly why Ive been staying home. 

They got my results back and tell me I might have small kidney stones and to drink a ton of water to try to flush them out. Super easy request seeing as Im still throwing up multiple times a day. 

The specialist is an oncologist. They are watching me to see if I have leukemia. Didnt know that until I literally am sitting in the oncologist office, and shes the one to tell me why Im there. I get they didnt want me to worry. But Im starting to feel like Im falling apart.

Im finally feeling his kicks and movements. Its bringing me a lot of peace, and its so wonderful to feel like hes okay in there. We get our ultrasound and no tumor, no cleft and no heart defect. thank God. We started getting stuff for the nursery and putting things together. The HG is getting lighter. Only a few days a week Im throwing up. I feel like I can truly see the beautiful light at the end of the tunnel.

I developed this cyst in my right breast, that grew from a dime size to about the size of a clementine, and was so incredibly painful. It got red and swollen until it was purple. Again they didnt want to give me antibiotics and there was nothing I could do but put a compress on. I couldnt even wear a bra. I had to keep going to work or they would drop my benefits. Eventually the cyst burst on its own and all this puss came out. It drained for three days. They had to express it further and finally put me on antibiotics. I had that open wound on my breast for about a week, and kept having to rewrap it, to the point the tape was tearing little parts of my skin off. But it did finally heal. 

This past week, Tuesday I wake up with some sort of respiratory situation again. My throat is so sore I cant swallow and have a fever. They still want me to come into work, so I do. 

We woke up Wednesday morning to my beloved dog Sam having some neurological symptoms, and we had to lay her to rest on Wednesday. After thirteen beautiful years. This is the hardest thing Ive ever been through. 

I try to go to work Thursday, but I was so broken I just left. I told my boss I couldnt be here, I couldnt even think. Theyre probably going to fire me. I dont even care anymore. I cant deal with all of this. Im now so incredibly sick, coughing things up, sore throat, drainage etc; if I could, I wouldnt go in to work tomorrow either. 

Please: I need some advice. Any advice. If you been through a rough pregnancy or grieving while going through this, please let me know how you made it. I feel like Im trying my best to keep my head held high but its one thing after another, like waves crashing down on my head and I cant catch my breath.

I have genuinely not changed my calorie intake from pre-pregnancy and I think that's what's so frustrating to me. I eat the same portions, and haven't had intense cravings or anything along those lines. But I'm still gaining weight. 

The big problem is up until 3 weeks ago, my blood pressure was normal! No issues whatsoever. I monitor it at home and at the doc appts of course. Now, at 30 weeks pregnant it is high and stressing me out. 140s/80s. 

On top of that I have failed both 1 hr glucose tests I was given by 10mg and even though I already passed my first 3 hr glucose test, I have to go in for a 2nd one tomorrow. I'm terrified of failing it. 

The rational part of me knows that this is related to the pregnancy but I keep hearing stories of women who started getting high blood pressure during pregnancy and it never went away and now they've been on meds for 10+ years. 

But I'm scared of what gestational diabetes AND high blood pressure may result in for me and my baby in these final weeks.

2025-03-16,1742144236.0,6 week ultrasound questions,"Hi everyone, I (m, 30) and my wife (f, 27) found out were pregnant around a month ago. My wife would have been around 6 weeks and 4 days today. 

Unfortunately, she began having intense bleeding a few days ago (at around 6 weeks). We went to the hospital, worrying that it might be ectopic. They did an ultrasound and could barely see the gestational sac. They couldnt visualize a yolk or pole. They told us she was 5 weeks and 3 days pregnant by the imaging and that her HCG levels were relatively low for 6 weeks (around 830). They told us that the bleeding indicated that shes likely miscarrying. She had intense bleeding and was releasing clots for the last few days, but its just spotting now. Her pregnancy symptoms kind of just went away. All of these signs made us think that she already passed the tissue. 

Today, we went for a follow up with her ob-gyn and the sac wasnt just there, but it got larger. The yolk was a bit more visualized today although no embryo was seen. She couldnt see the pole. We were so confused but the doctor said that shes 99.9% sure that shes going to pass the tissue anyway. They took her bloodwork today as well to get some more insight. 

Now, my concern is two fold: 
1) is it likely that she wont be able to pass the tissue herself? What happens then? If the sac is still present and its growing, what does that mean? Is it a blighted ovum? 

2) is there any scientifically reasonable chance shes still pregnant? We were very upset the last few days and my wife just got over the fact that she likely miscarried, but after the ultrasound today, were both in an even more anxious mood, worrying she hasnt passed the tissue.

We're anxious as we're just finishing up university this summer. He's been working part time for a year already and he's going to go full time as soon as we're done with our thesis, but we're worried about money a little bit. We do have a place to live where we don't pay rent so that's sorted.
We're also scared about our families' reactions as we really don't know how they'll take the news when we decide to share.
I guess I'm just looking for a little bit of encouragement? Any other young mums that made it and can share their positive experiences? Is it normal to feel both on top of the world and severely anxious that we're too young and not ready at the same time?

I'm 9 weeks today. Supposedly. 
I'm freaking out constantly that maybe it's already gone. 
This is my third pregnancy, the first made it to 8 weeks but didn't develop past 7. Ended in a d&amp;c. The second made it to 7 and had a miscarriage on my own but I knew it was coming because my blood work wasn't great. 
This one I found out about on Valentine's. I'm not going to lie the timing couldn't be worse, 2 weeks after my due date is my brother's wedding that my husband is the best man in, I'm in the bridal party, and it's all happening at my parents house 4 hours away. But I still want this so bad. 
My husband is very encouraging and says we will keep trying as long as it takes but I'm 37. 
I have two different doctors, my normal gyno doesn't do babies anymore so she recommended my OB. I haven't seen the OB this pregnancy yet, I'm supposed to have an appointment this Wednesday and an ultrasound Thursday. I'm now freaking out because I went to look at the times and they're not showing up in the app anymore so if they got cancelled I'm going to cry. 
My normal gyno ordered blood work Feb 19 that was great and an ultrasound on Feb 26th that was also right on track. 
But I am not having morning sickness at all, maybe I'm just lucky. My breasts are tender and I'm extra gassy and very emotional and tired. But that's all my symptoms. It's making me so nervous. I keep wanting to like just keep taking pregnancy tests or something. How do you get over not knowing if it's ok or not? 
Like eventually they move and stuff so I imagine that will be reassuring. But if it's still there this is the furthest I've ever been but I just don't know if it's still there. 
I'm so sorry this is just a ramble. My Brain is fried, my therapist is out of town for a few weeks, I'm having a time haha.

Im not too sure what to do here. Im at 20 weeks, so far everything has been great during this pregnancy, but it seems the last two weeks my health is going haywire. The baby is perfectly fine, which Im super happy about. 

Recently got diagnosed with GD at 18 weeks. My blood pressure recently has been elevated, 152/90 as of 3/14. Ive never had high blood pressure before. Last appointment (last week) was 140/60. And my heart rate wont rest below 113. My thyroid levels are also way off (had It removed a couple years ago due to cancer), which they think might be throwing off my heart rate. 

Ive been doing so good with the GD and diet and all that, but now the BP is another obstacle I need to figure out. I did the urine test early on and passed it so preeclampsia wasnt a worry. Theyre having me do it again to see if preeclampsia is now a factor. I dont have any hand or foot swelling and no headaches. 

Has anyone had to deal with GD and HBP during pregnancy? Was there anything you were able to do to help with the HBP? Im going to attempt to cut out a looooot of salt from my diet to see if that helps at all. Ive also only been drinking water since week 16 when I failed the one hour glucose test in case it became a concern later on. 

Im sorry if this seems like its everywhere. My brain is a giant scrambled egg right now with everything going on >r

2025-03-16,1742150634.0,Im scared of getting pregnant&.,"TW: mention of abuse, miscarrying, mental health, etc. 

Hey yall&.let me start off with this. I know a lot of pregnancies dont have bad things happen during them. 

I (22 F), and my fiancé (23 M), have been talking about children and how many we want and how we want to raise them since forever. Weve been together since I was 18. 

But, Ive started thinking.  What if my pregnancy doesnt go as planned? Theres sooooo many things that could go wrong bc of&well everything. Im terrified of the idea of getting pregnant. Im scared. I want a baby with my spouse so badly though within the next year or two. But Im terrified. What if I fail my baby? What if I miscarry. What if baby grows incorrectly or they are born with a disability (Id still love them dw). What if they grow outside of the womb? What if&&the list goes on and on and on. 


And Ive thought about it all. I miscarried (BD killed it) at 16. Ive talked to my OGBYN and asked if she thought I was infertile because of this. She said she doubts it. Also. My fiancé made a joke the other day. That he would freaking leave me if I was infertile. Now Im even more scared. 


How would he handle it if I gave birth to an unhealthy baby. Or if I have issues with miscarrying babies? My grandmother miscarried a baby boy before my mom was born. Im so scared. I just dont know. Id be devastated if I just couldnt&have children. Also the world we are in today scares me just as much. I was talking with finance about it. Especially about a baby girl. I had a really hard childhood. I had an alcoholic abusive father. I was SA multiple times by multiple men. I was almost trafficked. I have been attacked, I went through substance abuse. I got in a bad crowd. Stuffed with mental health and still do. 

Am I overthinking all of this? Like I feel like I have every reason to fear the future. But also. The joy a child would bring to my life would be immense. Ive always dreamed of having a big family and being a mother. But&..what if it doesnt go as planned? I just dont know. I know that yall may laugh at this. But its a genuine fear. Please help me calm my nerves or speak sense into me. But please also tell me the truth. Did any of yall go through this?

2025-03-16,1742113615.0,Having a rough time with FT pregnancy and scheduling appointments. Freaking out over nothing?,"Not sure if it should be under Need Advice or content warning, but mild talk of possible ectopic/misscaraige, so want to be on the safe side. I guess more of a rant as well.  
EDIT: Anywhere I said Advil, Im not taking advil, its off brand Acetaminophen, I got my name brand drugs mixed up,

FTM (22) here, first knowledge of the pregnancy was an at home test, and we are super excited! Id been trying to find an ob/gyn to get scheduled into, but everyone's booked out till April. Cons of being in a town with no other hospitals for 3+ hours.

For a few weeks, id been having terrible right side cramping, enough to bring me to tears in the middle of the night, and overall soreness in my abdomen. After about two weeks, my husband finally forced me to go to the ER to make sure it wasn't ectopic, my appendix, or some other thing. After an ultra sound, the tech looking confused, and two much more in depth ones, they determined I have two endometrial horns? The doc wasn't too entirely sure, but she said that I have a yolk sack w/ no fetal pole in my right horn, and ""small nonspecific fluid or hemorrhage within the left endometrial horn"", along with my right ovary being 2.6x1.9x2.6, and my left one being 4.1x2.1x3.2.

The docs seemed a little concerned, and gave my pregnancy a 50% viability, and wanted me to come back for a repeat quantitative HCG in 48-72 hours, and wanted another ultrasound in 1 week. I was also put on strict pelvic precautions, with no heavy lifting. They referred me to an OB/GYN in branch and sent me on my way.

We came back 3 days later to do the repeat test, and they didn't put in a lab, no one there knew anything about it, they said that was something for my OB to schedule. The only scheduling I can get anywhere close to the ob is with a nurse practitioner New Patient appointment in two weeks. They'll only check my vitals and get me into the system as a patient, a 15 min appointment. I wont even be able to see a doctor. The one they referred me to was on maternity leave, and the only doctor with any slots open was available for mid April, but I cant be scheduled for that at all until my new patient. I cant get in for an ultrasound unless I go back to the ER and check myself in again, or I wait till April to get myself seen by an ob and assessed.

I'm still in a lot of pain, its been about a week calling all over town and even to other towns, and no one can seem to squeeze me in. I cant really sit comfortably, and I don't know if this is normal cramping and I'm being dramatic or what, but work isn't helping me out either. The ER nurse wrote my precautions on my discharge papers, and gave me a note for work, but they ""don't take doctors notes"" and are trying to argue that pushing and pulling carts is ""not lifting because its PUSHING, duh"". I feel like I'm about to pass out on my shifts, but I don't want to go back to the ER just to be told the exact same thing.

Is first trimester usually this rough? I know the vomiting and the tiredness are normal, I can hardly keep anything down and I sleep for 20 hours a day on my days off, but I just cant shake the feeling that somethings fundamentally wrong. I'm taking Advil, but I'm afraid of taking too much, I've always been an anti drugs (for me) kinda person, and its always been ibuprofen that's worked better for me anyways. Independent practices are just as booked up, and I cant de-stress when I'm hurting this much and worried about the baby being okay. Am I doing something wrong, am I missing something? I feel like no one ever had this much issue so early on,  and complications are either obvious, or happen later and they already have a doctor support system.

my husband and i had been trying for about 7 months. we had a blissfully happy first year of marriage before deciding to try. and everything about our story felt perfect. we had been in mexico days before my birthday having the holiday of our lives (pregnant all along!) and then finding out on my birthday was the most amazing gift. i am obviously beside myself. but i dont want this to be my story. i am generally a positive and resilient person. i struggle with depression so i have to be. i cant let myself back slide or sink. i want to be strong for myself, for my husband (who is just as affected by this loss as i am, i believe that) and my step son. who i have worked so hard with to have a beautiful, loving relationship. 

i need help. i woke up this morning wanting to feel happy it happened instead of sad its over. i feel robbed of the beautiful story, the first baby, the milestones and moments i was looking forward to. i dont know what else to say, im just looking for some sympathy and words of wisdom and encouragement to take on this day with my family feeling joy, gratitude, and hope. =",pregnant,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jcga4o/reframing_my_loss/
