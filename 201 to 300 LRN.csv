I decided to wait for my spring break. I currently just passed the embryo and am laying in bed typing this. I cried at first when I saw it but my brother came to reassure me and told me I was doing the right thing for both the embryo and myself.

I inquired about this about 8/9 weeks pregnant and he said he needed time and not to feel rushed to share the news.

I stopped working a few weeks ago and I just feel really overwhelmed by my house right now and I always see the ""nesting"" that should be happening while I'm on my maternity leave but it hasn't happened. I definitely had a burst of energy in the 2nd trimester, did some organizing and got the nursery exactly how I wanted but that energy is long gone now.

Most days I wake up still tired because I don't sleep well throughout the night. I get back spasms pretty often, swollen feet and ankles, all the normal stuff.. especially the more time I spend up doing things. Bending over can be very uncomfortable and I fell a few weeks ago so I have a lot of anxiety about tripping and falling again.

I know my husband is doing everything he can, we own businesses together so me not being there means he hasn't had a day off in weeks. My father in law will be in town around time of our due date to be able to relieve him but for now, he's just a bit bogged down and I can tell it's definitely impacting him although he never complains. He's wants me to rest, not overdo it too much but I'm genuinely getting anxious about the house. 

Clothing is piling up, I mean to fold and put it away but keep either falling asleep or just generally can't be bothered most of the time. I get the dishwasher ran as much as possible too, but I have 3 dogs and have been having a hard time keeping up with everything.

At the same Time through, most of abortion issues originate from the ethicality of It, which can't be completely objective because good and evil are overall subjective. Considering this, i think that the best overall ""objective"" solution to abortion issues would be a solution that wouldn't overall discriminately attack the fetus and/or the mother. The question is if It can actually be resolved in a way that would be found by the most amount possible of people as acceptable. We could try, like It Is done in many other ethical issues, to make a conclusion based on whenever or not human rights are respected in the situation. If we theorically consider fetuses as human lives(this statement Is found by overall most biologists as true based on multiple surveys such as the biomed One or others), then the killing of the human being would be considered as Murder as long as It Is premediated and unjustificate. In the law, with some excemption, Murder Is usually Only justificate if It Is done in self defense. Based on It, It can be found that if the fetus can potentially put the Life of the mother at risk, abortion would be a self defense of her Life. At the same Time through, this solution, even if It follow something objective such as the law, It probably wouldn't content a large amount of people.

3/14/2025,1741991016,"My husband wants more kids, are my conditions unreasonable?","When I met my husband I was a fence sitter. Over time I warmed up the idea and decided Id be okay with one baby. Husband wanted three, but was glad I was open to one. We got married and after a year of trying I got pregnant with my little girl who is due in June.

Now tell me why this man is watching me suffer and is already talking about a second baby??
We had discussed right before I got pregnant that I MIGHT do two, but we dont know what pregnancy and parenthood will be like and Im not rushing to make that decision before we see what life is like with a baby.

He keeps saying the baby needs a sibling and he really wants a boy and a girl. I thought on it and decided under certain conditions I could be open to one more, definitely not three.

My conditions: 
1. We must be comfortable with the political and economical climate at the time specifically in regard to womens rights and maternal rights.

2. After breast feeding husband pays for a breast lift and tummy tuck if needed.

3. He must be okay with stopping at 2 even if we have another daughter. By stopping at 2 I mean he will get a vasectomy.

Husband is willing to accept 1-2 and says even if its another girl hed gladly stop at 2 babies so she can have a sibling. 

However, he says he will not get a vasectomy. I explained in detail how its reversible and much safer than me getting my tubes tied. He insists we can continue to use condoms and plan B as needed. I told him currently in the USA they are working to ban birth control, abortion, and plan b and we will have no fall back if I get pregnant at 40 which we both agree we wouldnt want another kid at that age.

Is this unreasonable? He says he doesnt want to mess with his downstairs and I rolled my eyes and reminded him what Im doing to my body for us to have a child.

My husband has been kind and taken good care of me through this, but I feel Ive compromised a lot and met him half way on our ideals with what our family will be like. Is a vasectomy really asking too much??

Edit: Id like to point out as there seems to be some confusion. Id never force my husband to have a vasectomy. Its simply a condition if he wants a second child which is something he wants. ",pregnant,Irrelevant

3/14/2025,1741963333,Positive MA experience - 10w 0d,"Using a throwaway for this one just in case. Although every MA is different, I want to share my story in hopes it will help others in a similar situation.

I discovered I was pregnant on Feb 26th; I'd had what I thought was a light period on January 29th-30th-31st, but it turns out that must have been implantation bleeding. I thought I was only 10 days late for my period based on the timing of that bleed, but it turns out I was much further along. I hadn't had many symptoms except for very sore breasts, some tiredness and loss of appetite, all of which I tend to get before my cycle anyway, so I didn't clue in right away.

I'm in a solid, loving relationship, but we just aren't currently in a situation to add to our family. I have a young child from my previous relationship, and we live in a fairly modest apartment, and for many other reasons it just wouldn't be right to add to the family right now. 

I was a bit panicked when I found out I was pregnant, but my partner was incredibly supportive and understanding. I called my doctor the same day and was referred to our local hospital which has a program for women seeking termination. My partner brought me to the appointment, which was on Wednesday of this week. I'm based in Canada and so it was a very calm and non-judgmental environment; I'm grateful to the doctor and nurse who walked me through my options and explained everything to me.

I was given an ultrasound and blood test the same day and they determined I was at exactly 10 weeks and 0 days, the cutoff for using medical termination in my province. They mentioned I could either schedule a surgical termination for the following week, or do the medical termination as long as I was willing to take the first pill that day. I decided on the medical because I wanted to end the pregnancy as soon as possible - my last pregnancy and birth process were extremely traumatic, and being pregnant again was giving me nightmares and flashbacks, so I couldn't handle the thought of waiting any longer.

Timeline:

6:00 pm Wednesday: took the mifepristone dose as directed. Had some very mild cramping starting about two hours later, which continued the following day.

1:00 pm Thursday: developed a headache, had some additional cramping and mildly upset stomach through the rest of the afternoon.

6:00 pm: took 10 mg ketorolac with a small amount of food.

6:45 pm: took 4 Misoprostol tablets in the cheek for 30 minutes as directed, washed down with water afterwards.

9:00 pm: started having some mild cramping which came in waves, slight chills. Very mild nausea which didn't last. Watched TV with partner and just tried to relax.

10:00 pm: started having some light spotting, cramps continuing. Cramps felt like my worst period day, nothing too major. Chills and started to have diarrhea.

10:45 pm: listened to an audiobook and went to sleep.

11:30 pm: woke up to a strange sensation, felt almost like my hands weren't attached to my body. Felt something shift in my lower abdomen, then a rush of fluid. Fortunately I was wearing heavy duty period undies in addition to a pad already and had no leakage. Went to the bathroom expecting pure blood but discovered it was pink tinted fluid which I assume was water breaking. Pad completely saturated. Pain very minimal.

As soon as I sat down on the toilet I felt something drop out. Had the sensation of needing to push, did so and a much larger clump came rushing out, along with quite a bit of blood. Peeked into the toilet and could see a ring shaped clot, and noticed a light pink thing partially submerged in the blood. It was not pleasant to see and I could tell it was part of a leg/lower torso of the embryo, extremely small but unmistakable.

Had a bit of a cry. Said I was sorry. Remembered what some of the other women have said on here about their babies becoming part of the water. I did not want to be pregnant, but I couldn't help but have feelings about it. I stayed for a while before saying goodbye and flushing.

1:30 am: woke up again, mild cramping and passed some more clots. Took a second ketorolac. Came back to bed and fell asleep easily.

6:00 am: woke up at my normal time, immediately felt different than I'd been feeling for the last few weeks. Breasts still a little sore but pain noticeably reduced from how they had been feeling prior. Did not have the morning upset stomach, and was able to enjoy a coffee (I'd been having aversion to it for about three weeks). Actually had energy as opposed to feeling extremely fatigued. Had moderate amount of blood on the pad and a few tiny clots when going to the bathroom, similar to a day 2 period.

10:30 am (present): cramps have almost completely subsided, have not needed more ketorolac. Ate some breakfast. Still have what is similar to a day 2 period. Energy is much higher than it normally is at this time of the morning.

I will still need to monitor for unusual bleeding, signs of infection, or increasing pain, and will need a follow up to confirm everything has passed, but ultimately the process was not what I expected. I originally worried that 4 Misoprostol wouldn't be sufficient, given that I was 10 weeks along and I've seen stories on here of women needing double the dose. I was worried it wasn't working initially as it took quite some time for the bleeding to start.

For anyone facing this situation right now: just know that you aren't alone. You are doing what is best for your body, and if you aren't ready to give up everything for a baby it means you're doing the right thing for your baby too. Sending healing thoughts and wishes to all of you who are reading this and feeling scared - you can do this if you need to.",abortion,Favor

Hello, im 33 ( my partner too) and have had 2 recurrent miscarriages in the last 8 months. The first one was at around 6 week and i miscarried at home. Second one was MMC and found through ultrasound at 8.5 weeks. Opted for D&amp;C as I couldnt go through the pain of miscarrying at home. OB sent the tissue for lab testing and turned out it was trisomy 16. My husband and i did all kind of testing suggested by our OB APS, karyotyping, TSH, genetic testing. Everything came back normal and OB says its just bad luck. 

I took 3 months break and tried again. We get pregnant each time in the first cycle itself while TTC. Im now pregnant again 5w 3d. 1st hcg at 5w 3040 and 2nd hcg after 48hrs 6622. Unfortunately my provider moved out of insurance network and the new provider is not ready to see me for ultrasound untill 9 weeks coz im a new patient.

3/16/2025,1742103467,Healthy eating vs junk!! Im getting pissed!,"Okay I need to vent!!! Ive ate a pretty clean diet before pregnancy, cooking myself every meal 5 days a week. Now that Im pregnant I really want to stick to that. My only indulgence before pregnancy was drinking coffee and coke, but I completely quit. I would only drink soda on the weekends anyways and eat out with my boyfriend for 1 meal (and it normally comes from a restaurant, so 2 meals a week not from home). 

I have a friend whos pregnant right now too and her whole pregnancy she follows no restrictions at all and I dont judge her for that. They drink coffee and soda every single day, eat fast food whenever they want. Sugar and sweets. I never said anything to her about it, because its her pregnancy and her life! Now that Im pregnant she is being sooo weird about how I eat?! I dont know if its making her feel guilty for the way she eats on a daily. Because it feels like Im being shunned by her for the way that I eat. God forbid I cook myself healthy meals !?! She says just drink soda and coffee, its a myth that caffeine does anything to a baby, just drink water to balance it out. Then she sends me a tiktok of a pregnant girl saying  when youre pregnant youll never want to eat a homecooked meal only fast food or takeout or anything trashy and quotes it saying facts. Like what the hell! Get over the fact that I told you Im not doing that and quit pushing it on me! Im so pissed! Im eating healthy for my baby and I and I dont care!

I have a history of bleeding suddenly during sex but it has been gone since a few months and during pregnancy its been gone altogether. 

Obviously Im scared, but also trying to downplay it to myself since I've had this issue before pregnancy, but then the final conclusion was that I probably have weak uterus lining. However shouldnt then the mucus plug not keep that stuff inside?
Or could the tissue-like pieces have been my mucus plug, which came out because of the sex and releasing the blood? I'm so scared!

I obviously called my midwife right away when this happened, but she couldnt really tell me anything other than having to wait for whether the bleeding will continue and have certainty during the planned ultrasound on Tuesday.

It only lasted 3 days and blood looks like blood post SA, I also had some mild cramps. Now mid march still no period. Whats bothering me a lot is that im cramping so bad and my stomach is very bloated since the last few days. I also noticed my breasts became sore again and I have many montgomery glands (similar to bumps ) on my nipple area. I used to have them when I found out I was pregnant.
All of the symptoms I had during the pregnancy disappeared but now I just feel so disturbed because I have no period and have the same symptoms again. I have been wondering if anyone experienced this? I dont feel ready to go back to the doctor again as im traumatized from that place and I live in a country where its illegal.
I really fear that my SA failed or the doctor messed up when he said my uterus is empty on the ultrasound. Could it be possible? Im freaking out. Could I possibly be still pregnant or is this the normal process?

3/13/2025,1741908477,PH to BKK Experience (Klongtun Hospital),"Hello everyone! I just wanted to share my experience getting an MVA (Manual Vacuum Aspiration) from Klongtun Hospital in Thailand. 


So on February 2024, I found out I was around 4-5 weeks pregnant. At that time I was thinking about ordering pills from WOW and doing the Pill Method instead, but since reading reviews that shipping could take quite a while, my boyfriend and I decided to go to Thailand instead. 


Before the trip and procedure, I talked to Jenny from Klongtun on Line. She gave me the options they had and the price list for all the procedure and the room rates, she also explained what to expect before the procedure (all the lab test and etc). So eventually I booked a slot for March 14 and she gave me an appoinment card. 


Fast forward to March 14, my boyfriend and I took an early morning flight from Manila to Bangkok after everything we checked in our hotel first and had late lunch, eventually we arrived at Klongtun Hospital at around 3:50 PM. 


This was how the process went for me:
- I showed them my appointment card then they quickly asked for my passport and 500thb (cash) for the ultrasound. 

- After the ultrasound, I found out I was already 8 weeks pregnant. 

- I had a consultation and the doctor recommended I do the MVA method, since the whole procedure would only take 5 minutes and I just had to rest for 2-3 hours after. She quoted me 11,000thb for everything (all the tests, MVA procedure, and room fee). She also disclosed that the doctor who will be doing my procedure is male. Afterwards, I paid the 11k using my debit card. 

- After paying, I waited for a bit to do the physical exam (they measured my height, weight, blood pressure, and they cleaned my V and did a pap smear, tbh the pap smear was kind of painful, more painful than the ones I've had in Manila). 

- After the physical exam, they asked my boyfriend to wait in another building then they accompanied me to leave my stuff on the 2nd floor and then accompanied me to the 3rd floor to change to a hospital gown and remove my undies. 

- After changing to a hospital gown, they asked me to lie down first. At this point, there was another girl sleeping in the same room so I assumed I would also be resting there too. 

- After a few minutes they asked me to go to the operating room. It was quite hectic because as soon as I got there they asked me to lie down with my legs up, the nurse to my left stuck a needle on my left hand to sedate me to sleep, while the nurse to my right was measuring my blood pressure, then the nurse in front of me was cleaning my V for the procedure. I saw the male doctor walk in as well, all the nurses were female BTW. At this point, I was feeling very anxious and I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to sleep but yes I did fall asleep immediately after they sedated me. 

- After the procedure, I woke up in a different room with lots of beds but I was the only one there, and at this point the nurse in charge wouldn't let me go up to use the bathroom she just told me to rest and sleep. After a while, she did allow me to use the toilet and she said it was ok for me to use a bidet. At this time she showed me my new ultrasound and the baby was no longer there. She told me the don'ts after the procedure such as: don't drink or eat food that's too hot, don't use a hot compress but warm compress is ok, etc). She also told me that I was asleep for about an hour and a half. She also gave the medicine (ibuprofen, antibiotics, iron pills) and instructions post abortion. After that, I just changed to my clothes and used the sanitary pad they provided. 

- After I was done, I just chatted with some of the nurses they told me it was ok to eat spicy food and raw food. Just not to consume alcohol. 


*Some tips I think that would help:
- go on a weekday as the hospital is not crowded at all. 
- don't be shy to ask the hospital and doctors all your questions before and after the procedure. Based on my experience, they were very patient and answered everything for me. 
- the first few hours were painful for me (felt like really bad dysmenorrhea), but what really helped eased my cramps was doing a warm compress, emphasis on warm. I brought my own hot/cold pack and used it in the hotel. 
- be prepared for the Bangkok traffic, I thought Manila traffic was already crazy but Bangkok is on another level. Although in my opinion, the price of Grab here is better than in Manila. 
- I highly suggest doing this with someone you can trust, as the whole process is very overwhelming and honestly you will need help and assistance esp during the first few hours after the procedure.


I just wanted to share my experience for those who feel anxious about their situation now. For me, the whole experience was very comfortable and I'm glad I got the procedure and healthcare I needed without any prejudice. If you have any questions about the price of the procedure, or if you just have any questions I highly suggest messaging them directly. 

Will try to update again about the post abortion experience. So far it's been about 12 hours since and I don't feel any pain at all.

3/15/2025,1742079370,Leg/Back Pain 5 Weeks,"So this is my second pregnancy, and my first was mostly easy. I had a subchorionic hemorrhage but it resolved itself by the end of my first trimester. Even though my son was born healthy, I didnt relax at any point in the pregnancy. I was constantly afraid something was going to go wrong. I was on medicine for my anxiety, and it helped some, but I would still have breakthrough panic attacks.

I dont want to be the same way this time around. I need to be there for my son, and I know it was hard on my husband, and hes already under enough stress.

Anyway, Ive had some serious aches in my upper legs and lower back ever since I found out I was pregnant, and that plus the sensation of increased discharge makes me think something is wrong. Is back and leg pain this early in pregnancy normal? I dont remember having issues like this with my back and legs hurting until further into my pregnancy last time.

I havent been to my OB yet and I wont get a chance to even see my baby until the beginning of next month, so please, help a second-time mama keep her cool while she waits for the confirmation appointment.",pregnant,Irrelevant

Its sadistic...Who would want to do that? It makes me angry seeing a 10 year old in my state get raped then she gets an abortion and the sadistic pro lifers have no sympathy for her. They just scream BABY KILLER! They dont care about what that child went through. They only care about you when your not born yet



. I listened to a song that is soooo good. Its called Kids only matter when their not born yet. SO TRUE! I decided to rant this because a friend of mine found out I am for abortions. HE TURNED ON ME! Wants nothing to do with me anymore. I tried explaining how I dont think its right to force children to give birth he just says ABORTIONS = MURDER And then blocked me.

Im at 32 weeks, and friends have been giving gifts and signing them Aunt. For example, they sign their name as Aunt Jane in cards to me, or with a note to baby on the inside of a book. 

No one has asked me how I feel about it, and tbh it feels weird!! I love these people, but many of them live far away, and I would call them FRIENDS, not family. Im so excited for them to meet this baby and vice versa, but I dont think they will be the babys family. 

Obviously family isnt just blood or marriage. But not every friend is family. Some friends are just friends, even if they are very good friends!

I think it bugs me because while I know they are really writing this because they feel close to me, my baby is a separate person. I want this baby to be able to have clear boundaries and expectations with adults. I want them to understand what it means to have familywhat you should be able to expect from family, and what they should be able to expect from you. Friends and family might blur together sometimes, but if someone says theyre your family, kids should be able to form ideas of what that means. And if they decide one of my friends feels like an aunt to them, or we become so interdependent with someone that they become family, then great! But thats not where we are with these folks. 

I know were some time away from these things actually becoming an issue, and that likely it will never be an issue. But some of these folks I see once every 1-3 years. I dont want to show up at their house for a visit one day and have to explain to them then that no, Im not going to tell my child to call them aunt, and they shouldnt ask for that, either. 

My husband assures me this is very far from a big deal, and I know hes right, but it just feels very intrusive. Its like the emotional equivalent of someone touching your belly without asking. I know people already love this baby, and I love that, but they are their own little person, not just an extension of me. 

I know others will likely have their own opinions here. Please feel free to share, but Id also just ask up front that you dont feel the need to say there is a right vs wrong here or try to put down the feeling that Im having.

3/16/2025,1742136839,Abortion is Absolutely Justified,"Premises:

1. Moral worth is based on current capacity for sentience, as **only sentient beings can experience harm**.

2. A pre-sentient fetus **lacks the ability to experience harm** and has no present interests.

3. Forcing a sentient person to remain pregnant **imposes significant physical, psychological, and emotional harm**.

4. Future potential does not create present moral worth; moral status depends on actual characteristics, **not hypothetical ones**.

5. When a **moral conflict** arises, the entity capable of experiencing harm (the pregnant person) has **greater moral weight** than a non-sentient fetus.

Conclusion:

Before fetal sentience, abortion is morally justified because **there is no meaningful harm to the fetus**, while forcing pregnancy **significantly harms a sentient person**.

Here is how it will work: Nano-bots are placed inside the female reproductive system. They work by monitoring the reproductive system for new, unique human DNA. If fertilization occurs, and such unique DNA is detected, the cell containing it is destroyed by the nano-bot. 

Not only does this stop 100% of unintended pregnancies when used, they are perfectly safe for the AFAB person as they only attack unknown, unique human DNA. And, it's completely reversible, simply through remote control.

3/15/2025,1742042496,Husband keeps putting his phone on airplane mode,"Im 36 weeks pregnant and I live at home with my husband who has a difficult time sleeping. He often goes to sleep in the guest bedroom down the hall.

I dont mind typically, since I know he struggles with sleeping. However now that Im deep in the third trimester, I need him to be available. And often during the night&he isnt.

2 weeks ago, I had very bad pains for an hour that stopped me from being able to switch sides or even get out of bed. I felt like a beached whale. I tried calling him and texting him, but his phone was on do not disturb and he didnt add me as a person to get through to him when I needed to. After about 20 mins, I was able to get up and crouch my way over to the room down the hall where I angrily woke him up. Bc hes such a disturbed sleeper, he anxiously started yelling what what what! At the top of his lungs at me. I was really upset, bc I felt when I needed him around for our baby, he wasnt there. He was angry for about ten minutes that I woke him up and was grumbling about how I get to nap during the day and he doesnt, but I wasnt having any of it. Respectfully I told him to shut his mouth and do/say nothing unless its about being there for me. Im Puerto Rican and I dont play that . Turns out the baby dropped 2 centimeters!

A couple days later, Im up in the am and hes still sleeping in. My 2 40 pound dogs are on me and Im so big I cant get them off. I try calling him, since I made myself a do not disturb contact and wouldnt you know, he put on his airplane mode! So I couldnt reach him regardless. His excuse was well I went to the other room at 6 am and I figured you were up and youd be fine. Suffice it to say, I was NOT happy. I told him he cant do this, that he needs to be reachable at all times, even if Im just downstairs. 
What if I fall? What if Im in pain again and cant move? What if the dogs wont let me get up? I said if he did it again, there would be big problems.

Now today, same thing. This time, he slept in the other room all night and the dogs are crying to be walked and Im texting/calling him..his phone is off. Im trying to yell for him..but he isnt hearing me. He also planned on waking up this am to go for a quick shake out run since hes running a half marathon tmrw. His mother is landing from Minnesota in a half hour and hes not up. I made it clear that we need to turn over the guest room for her, and need to sweep downstairs. I cleaned pretty much the whole house in prep for her yesterday. Went to Costco to do my final prep run for freezer meal prep for us, so he doesnt lose his mind cooking meals and making a mess bc I wont be able to help much, AND went to his race expo with him to pick up his bib and help him navigate it. Its his first big formal race and Ive ran multiple halfs and a marathon. So wanted to show my support for him.

Why is she coming? Bc he needs to go to a work conference for a week in Utah and the only way Id let him go is if he made sure someone was with me. Bc Im always tired and always need some help.

Am I being a brat or unreasonable to want my husband to not put his need for sleep over making himself available to me in my last month of pregnancy? He is other wise a wonderful husband during the day for the most part. Helps me clean the kitchen after I cook, will do some laundry, help clean the bathroom when I ask, walk the dogs when he can etc. He can be a little selfish from time to time with his day, but who cant? 

Im just getting so annoyed that I have to keep having this convo with him and Im debating telling his mother. Although I dont know what that will do..she tends to coddle him lol. Ive done a lot of work to get him to be less coddled lol. Ive also done a lot of work to get myself to a point where I dont just pop off on him. Being a New Yorker and Latina, thats my instinct. But he doesnt respond well to that and says Im being disrespectful and wont engage with me.

Sorry for the rant everyone. Any advice? Am I being nuts? Thanks!

Update: I popped off on him via text and told him Im telling both of our parents he keeps doing this. He said sorry and that his phone gets put on airplane mode automatically and its just habit. Well it wasnt a habit when he had it on do not disturb and we got into a fight over that right? Now that I can reach him through DND, now its a years long habit lol. I just told him that the fact that he didnt make it a priority to be cognizant of before bed shows how careless and selfish hes being.  I def got tough and rude with him and he told me to stop a few times, which promptly got met with a stfu >7<ý@. Now hes up and trying to check and see if Im ok.

3/15/2025,1742030442,We both want abortion but my wife can't get over the fears from her beliefs. How can i help her?,"Hi guys,

I seriously need your help on this, and this is a long one.

We just got married, and we f'd up. We know this is our mistake and we are blaming ourselves for letting this happen.

My wife and I just found out she's pregnant a few days ago, just a month after our wedding. The scan we did yesterday didn't even show the embryo inside the uterus, so we still have time to decide what to do. It's very early. It's too early even to do a MA. Now our initial reaction and up to even now after a few days is that we are not ready to have kids. We still want to enjoy our lives and no matter how we go through the scenarios in our head and together, we can not imagine and cannot accept the reality that there will be a children in our life, at least at this time. We fully believe having a kid will more likely leave us with more suffering, and unhappiness. We've talked to great lengths about this and agree that we will be most happy and content with just each other.

But my wife is a firm believer in Buddhist teachings, and she believes that we'd be committing a major sin, akin to murder and she seems to be unable to overcome this to get the courage to make the final decision. And i don't know how to help her get through this. I believe that the decision we want to make will lead to less sufferings, and better for all parties involved. But I fear that if we decide to have an abortion, she will also not be happy and will be in tremendous mental pain and I don't know if she will even be able to heal from it.

We are also super torn due to the fact that other than our own selfish needs and the vision that we have for our life together, there's no other reason to have this abortion. We are happily in love, both our families are well off, incredibly kind, helpful to us and will be over the moon if we reveal to them about the pregnancy. There's no real financial strain to speak of to take care of the baby if we let this happen. In our culture people believe that having children is a blessing, so there's no chance of talking to anyone else in our families about this, because we will face massive judgements that will make it impossible to even speak about an abortion, so that leaves us alone to work this out.

I've tried to convince my wife that this is not a crime, and we are making this decision believing it will be best for our life together, that what ever is inside her right now is not yet a living human being, and if we make this decision with kindness in our hearts, there is no need to fear of guilt, karma or anything like that. But she is dismissing me everytime I mention it and doesnt want or unable to let go of her strong beliefs. I can see that she's in the middle of a crossroads and cannot find a way out that she can accept. She's in great pain, and I'm feeling it too.

I spoke with my partner about this and we spent a while looking at other name ideas. We kept disagreeing on every name that we found, but we did eventually find one that we both like.

ER detected no intrauterine pregnancy with an HCG in the 200s. Also detected 3.6cm cyst on left ovary. They diagnosed me with a miscarriage.

Cut to calling the nurse to let her know the diagnosis and schedule a follow up. I had my follow up yesterday on 3/12. They gave me an ultrasound and again, no signs of intrauterine pregnancy. Cyst had shrunk slightly to 3.2cm. They took my blood again and I got the results today.

HCG is now 513. Completely baffled by this, I call the OB and speak with the nurse. She says she suspects that I am still pregnant just very early and thats why nothing is showing on US.

I am so confused. I was pregnant, not pregnant and pregnant again within 6 days. I had already started grieving the loss. Now Im in a state of depressive shock until I know for sure.

3/16/2025,1742127558,Post MA and I feel hopeless,"(Throwaway account! Sorry, english is not my first language, pardon my grammar lapses)

Had a successful MA yesterday. Process only took me 4 hours to pass my precious angel. The procedure didnt go very well and heres the context.

March 14,2025
- I asked my live-in partner if he can take a day off this weekend to help me with my MA. I explained and said sorry in advance if I ever sound demanding as this procedure is mentally and emotionally draining for me. He said yes, assured me that he would be there. I already took mifepristone at 11:30am. 
- Later that afternoon, he asked permission if he can report work to fulfill his duties as it was critical for him to decline (hes an engineer and I cant really understand how does his workload looks like on a daily basis) that he also needs to work on Sunday for rotational work. I also told him that I may not understand his workload, but I understand that he needs to focus at work, but the stress hes giving me is just unnecessary.
- As a response, I lashed out on him, voicing out my frustrations and he took it negatively and broke up with me as I was affecting his career.
- At that time, I was really disappointed that he cant fulfill his words.
- ADDITIONAL CONTEXT: 2024 I was at the hospital cause Im about to give birth to our first born, he left me at the hospital for the same reason.. WORK.. that they are understaffed and no one will shoulder his workload. My doctors and midwife even spoke to him to straighten up his priorities as Im in active labor, that they cant proceed with anything unless theres a guardian that can accommodate them if something happens to me, but ofc, as usual, he was really firm with his decision to prioritize his work over his partner. Im new in town and I barely even have friends to ask help with.

March 15 
- at 11:30am already took the first dose of misoprostol and it all came back to me, the abandonment, the neglect from the day I gave birth, and after childbirth, the paternity leave I gave him was just useless, later on I figure out that he didnt disclosed that I was pregnant to his company. And yes, he left me with child care after birth with minimal help as he told me, as he ALWAYS told me that I need to be self-sufficient. And yesterday, it all crashed down on me. The same reason I had to deal with from the times I asked him for help. So I decided to handle things on my own. I went through the process scared, anxious, paranoid and alone.
- He went to work in the morning and went home around 12pm to offer help but my mind is already dysregulated and already disconnected that I refused to receive any help from him. Then he got angry and started shouting and even throwing things inside our room while im actively going through the abortion. Even threatened to hit me but shouted in front of my face instead.
- I was still firm that Im not gonna accept any help from him, the amount of stress that hes giving me is just not helping. So I was left with my 1 year old, crying, doing tantrums while my body is shaking, painfully going through the process. He didnt even bother with child care so I can focus with my process. Idk, hes trying to help but not really helping, shit made me really confused at this point, but oh well, what can I do? I just continued the process with all the emotions that Im feeling. No one to talk to, just trying to seek comfort while watching tiktok clips. 
- 3pm, I was able to finish the procedure and was crying and breaking down for couple of hours after seeing my angel. 
- The next few hours I started bleeding heavily, passing big clots after and cramping so bad that ibuprofen didnt even help to minimize the pain. Fell asleep but woke up around 3am with severe cramping, passed another big clots until dawn. 
- I woke at 3am and I thought It was already done but he even messaged my only friend whos been there for me but was not pro-abortion, telling her that she should check on me as I was doing the abortion. Now my only friend already FOd me as it was against her ethics to tolerate this. I felt betrayed for what he did and disappointed with everything that I just want to die. My grief was beyond comprehension, I just dont understand anything anymore at this point.

March 16
- Post MA today, Im still somewhat heavily bleeding 1 1/2 pads within 2 hours, but I decided to go to the mall as if nothing happened, hoping I can pass out there and die, I was just nauseous and dizzy but still able to walk and even bought groceries for me and my 1 year old baby. 
- I broke down after eating, almost had a panic attack while lining up to the cashier cause I saw a pregnant woman being held by her husband/partner

I just got home and I broke down again. I cant do this anymore, this is just too much for me. My body is trembling and I feel cold. I just dont know how to push forward from here.

3/16/2025,1742124188,"My sister wants to plan the baby shower, but is totally dropping the ball. She is now hurt that my mother in law has been planning the whole thing. And she is taking it out on *me*.","My sister and I don't have the best relationship to begin with, which makes this a lot harder. She has narcissistic tendencies and there was a period of time where we didn't speak for almost 6 months. But she is always very insistent on us being family and that she wants to do things for me, and has been absolutely *adamant* about planning my baby shower for me. It just always needs to be on her terms, or she likes having something to threaten me with or dangle over my head (i.e. baby shower). Like, if I upset her in any way, she says ""well I just won't throw your baby shower then."" It's a control thing. This leads to her procrastinating, not getting things done in time, dropping the ball, or just not doing things at all. It's a lifelong pattern.

That being said, I was given advice about this situation in the AITAH subreddit to have someone else help her along or watch her. Hold her accountable essentially. My mother in law is an absolute angel. She and I are very alike, meaning she has been on top of everything. She volunteered to do the whole thing and was very happy to join with my sister when I suggested it. My sister seemed happy with it too. Until my sister just didn't do anything for it.

Fast forward a little bit, at 20 weeks pregnant my MIL said she didn't hear from my sister so she booked the venue and did all the phone calls to actually find a place. My sister did not help.

At 21 weeks pregnant, MIL and I are finding addresses and making spreadsheets to make RSVPs easier. My sister didn't add a single address.

At 21+3 weeks pregnant, my MIL sent my sister and I a message updating about addresses, and she specifically mentioned my sister's name and asked her if she wanted to do the invitations. I didn't hear back from my sister in days and, unsure of she reached out to MIL directly, I texted her myself asking if she said anything. She said she didn't because she's been so busy. Her never-ending excuse for everything she doesn't feel like doing. I said fine whatever. I texted MIL to let her know (kindly) about my sister procrastinating and to let me know if she doesn't hear back.

At 22 weeks pregnant, we see MIL in person, and she is excitedly showing DH and I shower invites she created! They're beautiful and so cute, and she took so much stress off of me in that moment. But fearing my narcissistic sister, I asked if MIL ever heard back from my sister. She said she did not. Of course!! Ugh.

Fast forward to last night 22+2, I talked to my sister to let her know that MIL was planning on moving full speed ahead of she didn't hear back. My sister attempted to give me every excuse in the book, and started saying ""well why didn't she follow up with me then??"" She completely ignored the fact that she did in fact receive MIL's message, AND mine following up. I told her she needs to communicate and that's why MIL is moving forward, because it needs to be done. The shower is still 3 months away but MIL wants to order invites and have family from out of state come, so about 2 months beforehand they will go out. My sister said she was planning on ordering the invitations at the end of April when she finally would have time. I said that is over a month from now! She became very aggressive toward me and said ""Your mother in law just wanted to help and now she's doing the whole thing!""

What she doesn't know is that I've learned to hold my ground.

I told her yes, my MIL is doing the whole thing right now, because you cannot communicate with anyone, you procrastinate, and this has to be done. You can do games or themes or decorations when you ""have time"" later, but I am not doing this with you. There is a baby on the way and he will come on the due date, not when you ""have time."" The shower will be done on the date it is scheduled. Not when you ""have time.""

My husband is aware and is very supportive. I reached out to my MIL to let her know that I spoke with my sister about everything (again leaving out details of arguments and feelings). I told her if she doesn't hear back from my sister before the end of the weekend to move forward with the invitation order.

I'm done sparing feelings for my sister because she doesn't seem to prioritize mine in any way. She hasn't lifted a finger for this shower and lets things go too far before she even starts. Not to mention she is completely broke and can't afford anything. My MIL is an absolute hero and I love her. It just sucks that my sister can't get her shit together long enough to even plan a party. A very important one to shower her first nephew to be.

Thanks for listening. This has been an utter nightmare but I feel a lot better not sparing feelings for someone who doesn't give a crap about mine. I am happy to grow a backbone and stand up for myself and my husband and my baby, and I am thankful to have my amazing MIL on my side.",pregnant,Irrelevant

Hi everyone,  

This is my first post, and I really need some opinions and support. In my community, theres a lot of stigma around elective C-sections, and its making me feel even more anxious about my decision.  

I am 32 years old from India currently living in Australia. Im currently 37 weeks pregnant with gestational diabetes but no other complications. I have a strong fear of vaginal delivery and have been leaning towards an elective C-section. My husband was initially supportive, but after our last appointment, where the doctor discussed the risks, he became a bit hesitant and asked me to rethink it. However, he reassured me that he would support my final decision.  

I also have my mom coming to help for three months postpartum, so I know Ill have support during recovery. Despite that, I cant shake the guilt and pressure from the stigma surrounding elective C-sections.  

Id love to hear from others whove been in a similar situation. How did you handle the decision? How was your recovery? And if youve faced judgment for choosing a C-section, how did you deal with it?

My husband and I decided to TTC last year this month and we got pregnant in July, only for it to end with an ectopic pregnancy rupturing and I lost my right fallopian tube. I was diagnosed with stage 3 endometriosis during this surgery (which I never knew I had) and it had eaten through my entire fallopian tube, causing the ectopic. It was covering my ovaries and all over my insides. After my ectopic, we continued TTC with times sex and using LH strips and BBT monitoring. 

After my ectopic, I started having really short luteal phases (7-8 days) several months in a row. After pushing my OBGYN, they finally decided to run CD21 progesterone labs and discovered that my progesterone was too low to confirm ovulation each month. They tested me three months in a row and confirmed I had stopped ovulating on my own. That combined with my stage 3 endo diagnosis, I was diagnosed with infertility. 

In January, they did an endometriosis excision surgery and found that my other tube was completely clear (yay!). They ran progesterone labs again the following month and I still was not ovulating. They decided to put me on Letrozole 5mg. 

I hit one year TTC this month and my husband and I took a trip to France. I didnt have my hopes high because Im so used to disappointment and seeing negatives, but the night I got home, on 10DPO, I got a positive. 

I immediately took a digital and it came back positive too. I cant believe my first cycle on 5mg Letrozole actually worked!! I am cautiously excited because the protocol following an ectopic is to get bloodwork every 48 hours until I can get a 6 week placement scan to ensure it is not ectopic again. I have started my bloodwork and my 6 week appointment is scheduled. 

I am terrified of losing this baby that we have tried for for so long. I am waiting for the other shoe to drop and I cant help but feel terrified that this baby wont make it, despite really healthy first bloodwork. ",pregnant,Irrelevant
3/13/2025,1741900417,Partner tried to convince me not to go to the hospital.,"Hi everyone just have something on my mind that I want to share.

I am 38 1/2 weeks and this past weekend I got extremely sick to the point where I could barely move. The next day I was having some very weird, heavy,  and sometimes painful feeling in my uterus so I decided to go to the hospital to get checked out. I am a black woman and also big and more so on the obese side of the BMI scale and both of those things have statistically been known to cause problems for pregnant women.

Anyways while getting ready to go my partner said how can I convince you to wait longer to go? Meaning to not go at all and today told me she asked her step mom as well during that time how to convince me not to go. She said she didnt want me to take a trip to the hospital when I didnt need to. She thought, that I thought I was in labor, she said she didnt know that I felt like something was wrong, and knew that you werent in labor. =- Like what? 

Either way how could someone want to convince their partner not go get checked out if they feel they need to. Im in disbelief that she would even go out of her way to try and find a way to convince me not to go. Ive had multiple near death experiences throughout my life and already dont have a good track record with doctors listening to me in the first place leading to almost catastrophic consequences.

3/15/2025,1742030442,We both want abortion but my wife can't get over the fears from her beliefs. How can i help her?,"Hi guys,

I seriously need your help on this, and this is a long one.

We just got married, and we f'd up. We know this is our mistake and we are blaming ourselves for letting this happen.

My wife and I just found out she's pregnant a few days ago, just a month after our wedding. The scan we did yesterday didn't even show the embryo inside the uterus, so we still have time to decide what to do. It's very early. It's too early even to do a MA. Now our initial reaction and up to even now after a few days is that we are not ready to have kids. We still want to enjoy our lives and no matter how we go through the scenarios in our head and together, we can not imagine and cannot accept the reality that there will be a children in our life, at least at this time. We fully believe having a kid will more likely leave us with more suffering, and unhappiness. We've talked to great lengths about this and agree that we will be most happy and content with just each other.

But my wife is a firm believer in Buddhist teachings, and she believes that we'd be committing a major sin, akin to murder and she seems to be unable to overcome this to get the courage to make the final decision. And i don't know how to help her get through this. I believe that the decision we want to make will lead to less sufferings, and better for all parties involved. But I fear that if we decide to have an abortion, she will also not be happy and will be in tremendous mental pain and I don't know if she will even be able to heal from it.

We are also super torn due to the fact that other than our own selfish needs and the vision that we have for our life together, there's no other reason to have this abortion. We are happily in love, both our families are well off, incredibly kind, helpful to us and will be over the moon if we reveal to them about the pregnancy. There's no real financial strain to speak of to take care of the baby if we let this happen. In our culture people believe that having children is a blessing, so there's no chance of talking to anyone else in our families about this, because we will face massive judgements that will make it impossible to even speak about an abortion, so that leaves us alone to work this out.

I've tried to convince my wife that this is not a crime, and we are making this decision believing it will be best for our life together, that what ever is inside her right now is not yet a living human being, and if we make this decision with kindness in our hearts, there is no need to fear of guilt, karma or anything like that. But she is dismissing me everytime I mention it and doesnt want or unable to let go of her strong beliefs. I can see that she's in the middle of a crossroads and cannot find a way out that she can accept. She's in great pain, and I'm feeling it too.

3/15/2025,1741998336,C-section rescheduled day of,"Today was supposed to have been my scheduled C-section. I (32 female 39 weeks and 5 days pregnant) had everything, literally everything, I could think of done, cleaned, prepped and figured out. So of course the day prior my fiancé comes down with an illness. Mind you I've been extremely hyper vigilant on avoiding any illnesses this entire pregnancy. I wear disposable gloves and use Lysol wipes at the grocery store, avoid crowded events and stay away from people who are experiencing any symptoms. 

Yesterday morning my fiancé woke me up to tell me he was ill so I had him take a 3 panel at home test for COVID19 and flu A&amp;B. Everything came back negative. I noticed that my throat was starting to feel sore as well so I called the labor&amp;delivery department where my csection was scheduled as well as my obgyn. They both said to just come regardless and even though my fiancé is sick with fever, chills, head/body aches, congestion and runny nose he could still come too. Of course we would need to take proper precautions though. 

I continued to finish my preparations last night with the hope that this was just the RSV, that I'm vaccinated from, currently going around but still i woke up this morning with extreme anxiety. Looking at my s.o. hardly able to stand I asked him to take another test. He did and tested positive for flu A. Mind you my fiancé isn't the greatest at self awareness. He has been constantly coughing into his hands and touching everything. The pets, grabbing silverware, light switches, door knobs and cabinets. I'm trying to stay as calm as possible repeatedly disinfecting things behind him and kindly suggesting that he frequently washes his hands, coughs into his shirt and avoids touching everything. 

I felt like my fate had already been sealed and I was about to have a C-section then come down with the flu with a newborn and have no one to help with the baby and C-section recovery. My fiancé is like the typical manly man that gets taken out by illnesses. Nothing against him but I know I wouldn't be able to rely on him to safely take care of the baby while avoiding transmission. So I called labor/delivery and they said they'd have my obgyn call me. He never did so I prepared to go in anyway and once I got there they had him on the phone and he said let's just go ahead and reschedule.

I was initially at first relieved because I can't handle the thought of doing all of this alone while sick. The thought of a newborn with the flu feels like a nightmare. Now I'm reading that pregnancy with the flu can cause still births. I am just so torn because my only concern is our baby and I worry if I made the wrong choice. I'm not sure exactly what I'm asking for on here. Maybe some shared experiences and advice. I wouldn't be able to live with myself if anything happened to my baby girl. My anxiety has been dragging me all over the place. Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read and respond to this.

EDIT: Anywhere I said Advil, Im not taking advil, its off brand Acetaminophen, I got my name brand drugs mixed up,

FTM (22) here, first knowledge of the pregnancy was an at home test, and we are super excited! Id been trying to find an ob/gyn to get scheduled into, but everyone's booked out till April. Cons of being in a town with no other hospitals for 3+ hours.

For a few weeks, id been having terrible right side cramping, enough to bring me to tears in the middle of the night, and overall soreness in my abdomen. After about two weeks, my husband finally forced me to go to the ER to make sure it wasn't ectopic, my appendix, or some other thing. After an ultra sound, the tech looking confused, and two much more in depth ones, they determined I have two endometrial horns? The doc wasn't too entirely sure, but she said that I have a yolk sack w/ no fetal pole in my right horn, and ""small nonspecific fluid or hemorrhage within the left endometrial horn"", along with my right ovary being 2.6x1.9x2.6, and my left one being 4.1x2.1x3.2.

The docs seemed a little concerned, and gave my pregnancy a 50% viability, and wanted me to come back for a repeat quantitative HCG in 48-72 hours, and wanted another ultrasound in 1 week. I was also put on strict pelvic precautions, with no heavy lifting. They referred me to an OB/GYN in branch and sent me on my way.

We came back 3 days later to do the repeat test, and they didn't put in a lab, no one there knew anything about it, they said that was something for my OB to schedule. The only scheduling I can get anywhere close to the ob is with a nurse practitioner New Patient appointment in two weeks. They'll only check my vitals and get me into the system as a patient, a 15 min appointment. I wont even be able to see a doctor. The one they referred me to was on maternity leave, and the only doctor with any slots open was available for mid April, but I cant be scheduled for that at all until my new patient. I cant get in for an ultrasound unless I go back to the ER and check myself in again, or I wait till April to get myself seen by an ob and assessed.

I'm still in a lot of pain, its been about a week calling all over town and even to other towns, and no one can seem to squeeze me in. I cant really sit comfortably, and I don't know if this is normal cramping and I'm being dramatic or what, but work isn't helping me out either. The ER nurse wrote my precautions on my discharge papers, and gave me a note for work, but they ""don't take doctors notes"" and are trying to argue that pushing and pulling carts is ""not lifting because its PUSHING, duh"". I feel like I'm about to pass out on my shifts, but I don't want to go back to the ER just to be told the exact same thing.

Is first trimester usually this rough? I know the vomiting and the tiredness are normal, I can hardly keep anything down and I sleep for 20 hours a day on my days off, but I just cant shake the feeling that somethings fundamentally wrong. I'm taking Advil, but I'm afraid of taking too much, I've always been an anti drugs (for me) kinda person, and its always been ibuprofen that's worked better for me anyways. Independent practices are just as booked up, and I cant de-stress when I'm hurting this much and worried about the baby being okay. Am I doing something wrong, am I missing something? I feel like no one ever had this much issue so early on,  and complications are either obvious, or happen later and they already have a doctor support system. I don't even know what I need, or what would help me.",pregnant,Irrelevant
