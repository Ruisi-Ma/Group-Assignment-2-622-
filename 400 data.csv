2025-03-16,1742135836.0,My husband and I are considering a late abortion-Help.,"This is a bit of a long story, but please bear with me.

Im a 31-year-old woman and have been with my husband for 13 years. Together, we have a beautiful 3-year-old son. My first birth was nothing short of traumatizinghe was diagnosed with a kidney condition at 20 weeks, which led to an induction and ultimately an emergency C-section. After his birth, he had to undergo a series of nuclear tests, adding to the trauma. It took me two years and a lot of therapy to begin healing from that experience.

A little over a year ago, we decided to try for a second baby. It took us a year to conceivea year filled with heartbreak and hurdlesbut finally, we had our miracle. Then, at 20 weeks, we received devastating news: our baby was diagnosed with a congenital heart condition, including moderate aortic stenosis and a ventricular septal defect. The uncertainty is crushing.

Although weve been told that our son will most likely live a normal life, we cant help but consider the possibility of termination. The stress, the mental load, and the potential trauma feel overwhelming, and I dont know if I have the strength to go through it again.

Im now 21 weeks. Time feels like its slipping away. I feel him moving, my belly is growing, and yet I find myself questioning everything. My whole life, all Ive ever wanted was to be a mother, and now I cant help but feel like Ive failed.",abortion,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jcmugs/my_husband_and_i_are_considering_a_late/

Ive just hit 32 weeks and Ive had excruciating headaches all week. Saw my midwife and my bp was 133/82 so she said its not high enough to be a concern and to ring the gp for stronger pain meds. Paracetamol wont touch the headaches and no protein in urine either.

2025-03-16,1742101915.0,I think Im having a miscarriage. Help please,"Hello,

Im going to give a detailed account of my experience. I may share unnecessary information, but thats because I dont know much about pregnancy or miscarriages.

Im 35. This is my first pregnancy. I removed my IUD 6 months ago but only last month my partner and I checked when was my fertile period and then had sex multiple times around that time.

We were very surprised I got pregnant. It felt easy, since it was the first time we really tried.  It felt very unexpected.

I discovered the pregnancy 5 days ago, and that should have been when it was a little less than 4 weeks long.

The miscarriage:
Day 1: 2 days ago I had some very brown discharge, what look exactly like what I get a day before my period. Later that day I got a little more and what looked like some very dark blood. The quantities seem small, not enough to fill a pad, but also seem a bit more than what I read that was normal to happen. I was supposed to be in the implantation phase.

Together with that I felt constant but very mild cramps. No other pains. I tested again to make sure I was pregnant. I had 3 positive tests already.

Day 2: I had very mild cramps also most of the day, and some very brown discharge in the morning. Maybe enough to cover half of a panty protector type of pad, those small ones.

Day 3: I woke up early this morning feeling still really mild cramps. When I went to pee I noticed very little drops of very dark or brown blood, like spotting, on the toilet paper. A couple drops in the toilet water. 

This is the entire situation. This doesnt look good at all, but I also didnt had any red, or mid period like blood coming out. The tiny cramps feel like something is cooking in my uterus, in a bad way. 

I honestly still dont feel like I had a miscarriage, but all the facts point towards the high chance that its already on the way. Mostly because I seem to have had 4x a higher volume of spotting than the usual, and these damn constant, often hard to notice cramps. Sometimes I feel like Im imagining them because I focus so much at that part of my back.

I am okay (as much as one can be) with the possibility of having a first miscarriage. I know how common these are, they happened so much around me already. And Im honestly already so relieved that my partner and I can conceive. My struggle now is not knowing for sure that the pregnancy is gone. Between the first spotting and then several hours without any spotting yesterday, I went from being almost sure it was going to be a loss to hopeful that maybe that was just the implantation symptoms. Maybe I was spotting more than usual because I do get very heavy period the first 2 days of a period.

Anyway, I of course tried to reach out to a doctor on Friday, when this first started, but couldnt get a hold of one. If anyone here lives in the Netherlands, youll know the struggle.

And I know nobody - other than doctors - can really tell me what is happening for sure, but I would still like to kindly ask for anyone who has similar experiences to share any information that you believe may help me.

And to anyone going through a miscarriage, I hope you have the support of people you love. For what I can tell so far, thats the most important. 

Thank you,
Aline",pregnant,14.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jcebbw/i_think_im_having_a_miscarriage_help_please/
2025-03-16,1742135406.0,Baby name help,"Hi all. I need some advice on the name for our baby. We are keeping the sex of the baby a surprise but wanted to have plans for the names in either situation. My husband and I always been on the same page for the names but recently thats come into question. We originally agreed on Thomas Ike and Margaret (Maggie) May. There wasnt an inspiration behind either we just liked the names. 

So what changed? In January my grandfather died and while it was something we were expecting, it really rocked me. It made me think about how present he was in my life and how missed he is. Ive cried nearly every week since his death and it still hits me at random times and places. It really is such a strange thing to be grieving life while growing new life inside you. 

Due to this impact, I recently started thinking about changing our boy name to Thomas Lawrence Lawrence was my grandfathers middle name. I spoke to my husband about this thought and he said ultimately he would be on board if thats the route I want to move in but he feels like the recent grief is heavy on my heart and thats whats inspiring the name change. He is correct. But since the convo I really have no idea anymore. Ive sat on the question independently for about a month and still cant make up my mind. 

Im also worried because since Ive started telling people the names we have, that Ike is an atypical name. It normally makes people stop and question if we said Mike or just flat out misheard me. It makes me worry if we have a boy and I go with the original name that Im setting him up for a life of having to correct people.  

Should we change our boy name to Thomas Lawrence or keep the name as Thomas Ike?

2025-03-14,1741963333.0,Positive MA experience - 10w 0d,"Using a throwaway for this one just in case. Although every MA is different, I want to share my story in hopes it will help others in a similar situation.

I discovered I was pregnant on Feb 26th; I'd had what I thought was a light period on January 29th-30th-31st, but it turns out that must have been implantation bleeding. I thought I was only 10 days late for my period based on the timing of that bleed, but it turns out I was much further along. I hadn't had many symptoms except for very sore breasts, some tiredness and loss of appetite, all of which I tend to get before my cycle anyway, so I didn't clue in right away.

I'm in a solid, loving relationship, but we just aren't currently in a situation to add to our family. I have a young child from my previous relationship, and we live in a fairly modest apartment, and for many other reasons it just wouldn't be right to add to the family right now. 

I was a bit panicked when I found out I was pregnant, but my partner was incredibly supportive and understanding. I called my doctor the same day and was referred to our local hospital which has a program for women seeking termination. My partner brought me to the appointment, which was on Wednesday of this week. I'm based in Canada and so it was a very calm and non-judgmental environment; I'm grateful to the doctor and nurse who walked me through my options and explained everything to me.

I was given an ultrasound and blood test the same day and they determined I was at exactly 10 weeks and 0 days, the cutoff for using medical termination in my province. They mentioned I could either schedule a surgical termination for the following week, or do the medical termination as long as I was willing to take the first pill that day. I decided on the medical because I wanted to end the pregnancy as soon as possible - my last pregnancy and birth process were extremely traumatic, and being pregnant again was giving me nightmares and flashbacks, so I couldn't handle the thought of waiting any longer.

Timeline:

6:00 pm Wednesday: took the mifepristone dose as directed. Had some very mild cramping starting about two hours later, which continued the following day.

1:00 pm Thursday: developed a headache, had some additional cramping and mildly upset stomach through the rest of the afternoon.

6:00 pm: took 10 mg ketorolac with a small amount of food.

6:45 pm: took 4 Misoprostol tablets in the cheek for 30 minutes as directed, washed down with water afterwards.

9:00 pm: started having some mild cramping which came in waves, slight chills. Very mild nausea which didn't last. Watched TV with partner and just tried to relax.

10:00 pm: started having some light spotting, cramps continuing. Cramps felt like my worst period day, nothing too major. Chills and started to have diarrhea.

10:45 pm: listened to an audiobook and went to sleep.

11:30 pm: woke up to a strange sensation, felt almost like my hands weren't attached to my body. Felt something shift in my lower abdomen, then a rush of fluid. Fortunately I was wearing heavy duty period undies in addition to a pad already and had no leakage. Went to the bathroom expecting pure blood but discovered it was pink tinted fluid which I assume was water breaking. Pad completely saturated. Pain very minimal.

As soon as I sat down on the toilet I felt something drop out. Had the sensation of needing to push, did so and a much larger clump came rushing out, along with quite a bit of blood. Peeked into the toilet and could see a ring shaped clot, and noticed a light pink thing partially submerged in the blood. It was not pleasant to see and I could tell it was part of a leg/lower torso of the embryo, extremely small but unmistakable.

Had a bit of a cry. Said I was sorry. Remembered what some of the other women have said on here about their babies becoming part of the water. I did not want to be pregnant, but I couldn't help but have feelings about it. I stayed for a while before saying goodbye and flushing.

1:30 am: woke up again, mild cramping and passed some more clots. Took a second ketorolac. Came back to bed and fell asleep easily.

6:00 am: woke up at my normal time, immediately felt different than I'd been feeling for the last few weeks. Breasts still a little sore but pain noticeably reduced from how they had been feeling prior. Did not have the morning upset stomach, and was able to enjoy a coffee (I'd been having aversion to it for about three weeks). Actually had energy as opposed to feeling extremely fatigued. Had moderate amount of blood on the pad and a few tiny clots when going to the bathroom, similar to a day 2 period.

10:30 am (present): cramps have almost completely subsided, have not needed more ketorolac. Ate some breakfast. Still have what is similar to a day 2 period. Energy is much higher than it normally is at this time of the morning.

I will still need to monitor for unusual bleeding, signs of infection, or increasing pain, and will need a follow up to confirm everything has passed, but ultimately the process was not what I expected. I originally worried that 4 Misoprostol wouldn't be sufficient, given that I was 10 weeks along and I've seen stories on here of women needing double the dose. I was worried it wasn't working initially as it took quite some time for the bleeding to start.

For anyone facing this situation right now: just know that you aren't alone. You are doing what is best for your body, and if you aren't ready to give up everything for a baby it means you're doing the right thing for your baby too. Sending healing thoughts and wishes to all of you who are reading this and feeling scared - you can do this if you need to.",abortion,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jb5i23/positive_ma_experience_10w_0d/

Ill get straight to the point, me and my gf are expecting our little girl in May and I could not be anymore excited to be a girl dad! She is currently 7 months so its getting closer. 

Tonight we had a bad argument. My gf has been sooooo clingy to the point its suffocating me. I dont understand and never will understand pregnancy, all I could do is research but Ill never understand what it feels like. I applause all you women who sacrifice your bodies for our children.

Shes been so clingy up the point where if I wanna go to the gym, take care of errands, or go with my family, she gets upset. I tell her to go with me but the days she doesnt feel like doing anything, she stays and complains. Ive been going to the gym and dropping weight and feeling better and I work pretty much everyday because Im trying to save up for a new house for all three of us. Its non stop with me, Im always working just to save money and grind for us. 

Tonight, she started ranting to me that Im never there for her or she feels alone. Ive heard it before and I step up and when she asks me to massage her feet, back, shoulders, etc I do it with no complaints. I always check on her when Im at work and always asks if she needs anything before I get home. She once again, said that she feels like Im not affectionate when all I do is care for her. She literally thanked me the other day and said she appreciates me everyday because Im so good to her but tonight I hit a boiling point..

I regret it and said some ugly things because she started saying ugly things to me and absolutely HATE yelling especially since our little girl can hear now. But I feel soooo unappreciated when she complains about me daily and when Im doing the best I can for her.. and for us.. we never really fight but its just built up and built up to the point where I got mad tonight. She left and went to go stay with her sister. Another thing i talked to her about was keeping our business private. The last fight we had she went and told her mom& like we have these arguments but I never go and run and tell my parents.. its so frustrating. I love her and thank her everyday for carrying our little girl but I feel like she doesnt see how HARD Im trying for us. I come home from work and I cuddle with her and spend time with her and its not good enough.. still saying Im not affectionate. She began crying saying that Im not affectionate and everything Im literally trying my best here.. but anything I do isnt good enough. 

I admit it, theres times Im exhausted from a 13-15 hour shift and im not as affectionate.. but Im tired. Then I still massage her with NO COMPLAINING.

2025-03-13,1741906245.0,Deciding between MA or SA. Keeping the abortion a secret. Help?,"Hi there. I am currently deciding between an MA or SA. I do not know how far along I am ( I am about to make an appointment at PP for next week) but Im guessing I am around 8-9 weeks. Unfortunately, I have to lie and say that I am having a miscarriage. There is more info below on that. 

A couple of things - I had a MA about a year ago. The process was long and extremely painful for me. I was bleeding heavily for about 24 hours, and kept bleeding for several days with pain. It was an extremely difficult process and I still felt completely drained at my follow up appointment.

I have a few reasons why I am not sure if a SA or MA is better.

1. I will not have an informed support system this time around. I dont want to get into too many details, but I have to lie and say that I had a miscarriage and not an abortion (I know some will think this is wrong. I am sorry but it is my situation. I will be leaving this situation once the abortion is done). This is the main reason why I think a MA might be better, unfortunately.

2. The pain. I understand SA is also painful, but from what I have read, it is much quicker. And I like the idea of having a medical team with me during the whole process. 

3. I am nervous about having to sneak to two separate appointments for an MA. 

I also have a few questions, if anyone is willing to share. 

1. How long do you bleed after the SA procedure? 

2. Can a doctor tell that I have had a surgical abortion if I go to the ER? I believe they cant tell if I have had an MA.

3. When I go to my appointment, will they do the SA on that day?

2025-03-16,1742140819.0,Boyfriend forced me to have an abortion &amp; dumped me 2 days later,"I feel so lost, and I dont know how to move forward. My (now) ex-boyfriend pressured me into having an abortion, making me feel like I had no choice. The concerns over the extent of his forcefulness &amp; controlling behaviour were also logged at the time by the medical professionals at the abortion clinic. Two days later, he dumped me over text, told me he never wants to have children with me completely cut me off, and within two weeks, he was posting date night pictures with someone new, as I lay in bed still recovering physically &amp; mentally. He has a narcissistic mother that also blocked me on the day of my surgery and never even acknowledged that I was pregnant. Its just them two, his father is not around &amp; has a completely new family. Its like they both erased me and my baby overnight.

The worst part isI regret it. I didnt want to go through with it, but I was made to feel like I had no choice. I would cancel consultations until he noticed I was doing that so he would start driving me there, I couldnt take the preparation pill for hours but the amount of force I had received, it made me feel like I would be in serious danger if I kept my baby. Now, Im left with this overwhelming grief that I dont know how to process. I feel like a part of me is missing, and I dont know if Ill ever forgive myself. Its hard to function normally when the pain is this heavy. Its been 3 weeks now and I havent eaten a full meal since the day before the surgery, Im signed off work due to my mental health, I dont have any friends as he completely isolated me, and I get no more than 3 hours sleep a night. 

What makes this even harder is that just 10 days before I conceived, I was told I was infertile. Because of my PCOS, one of my ovaries no longer works, and I was led to believe that getting pregnant naturally would be nearly impossible for me. So when I found out I was pregnant, it felt like a miraclesomething I never thought Id get the chance to experience. And now, knowing that I was forced into giving that up, without knowing if Ill ever get another chance, makes the grief even more unbearable.

Long story short, I somehow managed to pull a rib muscle? Im very grateful everything was okay. All tests came back clear, and they said it sounded like I was nervous on the phone which led to a high BP. 

My partner is genuinely so angry that we spent 2 hours getting checked. I dont even know how to handle this.

For my first 2 children we found out the sex of our babies at birth, so I think I was just too focussed on actual labour and birth to be thinking about the sex! We decided to find out this time now but my husband loves making the calls when theyre born to tell everyone so were keeping it a secret just the 2 of us which is really exciting, also why I cant speak to anyone about it! 

We have 2 perfect boys, for my first I didnt really care for my second I so wanted another boy, I have a sister so I wanted the same sex bond I grew up with and I was so happy for my son that we had a boy. We always knew wed have a third. This time I dont really know how I feel, I love having boys and I know Ill adore having another one, my youngest wants a boy. It occurred to me this week that this is our last ever baby, so if it is another boy I will never experience having a daughter and everything that comes with that, my eldest really wants a girl. 

Id never thought about it too deeply before but it hit me a bit today that one way or another that tomorrow we will know for sure what our family will be and thats a bit overwhelming. Having never found out in pregnancy before I didnt realise how utterly nerve wrecking it is! I cant think about anything else, please tell me Im not the only one! I dont even have a real gut instinct, I think it will be a boy because I think thats all my husband makes but at every scan so far we come away thinking maybe its a girl.

I ordered the pills online, it's my second abortion so I didn't go to a doctor, also just for the simple fact that I have state insurance and it's very hard to find a provider around me that covers the cost of an abortion.

It feels just a tad bit more intense than my normal period cramps but nothing crazy. My bleeding has started lightening up over the past day or 2, but this cramping has just been so consistent over the past 2 days that I'm starting to worry. Last night I decided to take a pregnancy test just to make sure that my hcg levels were going down, but it still came back very positive.

I can say that I did see the sac come out when I had my abortion, so I know that my body dispelled SOMETHING. All of my bleeding was normal and everything had passed. I guess I'm just concerned about a potential ectopic pregnancy? I've never experienced one so I'm not sure what that pain would feel like. The cramping just feels very odd, especially for how directed it is in my left side and it's not just a general cramping feeling in my uterus.

2025-03-14,1741941564.0,Abortion Is Okay Because Its Their Choice,"At the end of the day, abortion is a personal decision, and no one should be forced to stay pregnant against their will. Pregnancy is a major medical event that affects a persons body, health, future, and life in ways that only they can fully understand. No one else has to experience the physical pain, the risks, the emotional toll, or the lifelong consequences of giving birthso why should anyone else get to decide?

Some argue that a fetus has a right to life, but even if we grant that, no one has the right to use another persons body without consent. We dont force people to donate organs, even if it would save a life. If bodily autonomy applies to everyone else, why should it suddenly stop applying to pregnant people?

People get abortions for all kinds of reasonsfinancial instability, medical risks, being too young, not wanting to be a parent, or simply not wanting to be pregnant. And they shouldnt have to justify it. No one is obligated to give up their body for someone else, and pregnancy should be no exception.

2025-03-15,1742027301.0,Nervous! Question (and ramble) regarding GP,"So Im currently 7 weeks pregnant, if my workings out are correct.
Ive decided on an abortion as my partner and I just arent ready at this time - were looking for a bigger house as we are in a tiny house with no space for anything and we are trying to improve our quality of life.
I am an anxious person and I understand that having a baby is going to be stressful and an anxious time, and If we are going to do it at some point, I want to remove as much of that anxiety as possible. I feel having a bigger house and being in a space where we can do it at least removes some of that anxiety. I genuinely cannot see us with a baby in this space currently. 
I did come off the pill about a year ago as I didnt want to be on it anymore and at that point we sort of said just see what happens, but have been careful and used condoms where we could. Since then my anxiety/OCD has gotten worse and now its actually happened I just cant go through with it, for our sake and a childs sake.
I did go to my GP last week as I had some bleeding and cramps (which he said were normal) and the pregnancy was confirmed there and documented on my record.
I told him I was no longer on the pill and he asked me if I was keeping the pregnancy. I panicked and said yes as I was scared hed judge me when Id just said I came off the pill.
Now I have my consultation next week and Im worried that when the GP surgery finds out Ive had a termination that I will get in trouble.
I know you dont have to tell your doctor but as its on my record that Im pregnant, I dont want to turn up at a next appointment (whenever that may be) and they think Im still pregnant.

My (now) ex-boyfriend pressured me into having an abortion, making me feel like I had no choice. The concerns over the extent of his forcefulness &amp; controlling behaviour were also logged at the time by the medical professionals at the abortion clinic. Two days later, he dumped me over text, told me he never wants to have children with me completely cut me off, and within two weeks, he was posting date night pictures with someone new, as I lay in bed still recovering physically &amp; mentally. He has a narcissistic mother that also blocked me on the day of my surgery and never even acknowledged that I was pregnant. Its just them two, his father is not around &amp; has a completely new family. Its like they both erased me and my baby overnight.

The worst part isI regret it. I didnt want to go through with it, but I was made to feel like I had no choice.

Its hard to function normally when the pain is this heavy. Its been 3 weeks now and I havent eaten a full meal since the day before the surgery, Im signed off work due to my mental health, I dont have any friends as he completely isolated me, and I get no more than 3 hours sleep a night. 

What makes this even harder is that just 10 days before I conceived, I was told I was infertile. Because of my PCOS, one of my ovaries no longer works, and I was led to believe that getting pregnant naturally would be nearly impossible for me. So when I found out I was pregnant, it felt like a miraclesomething I never thought Id get the chance to experience. And now, knowing that I was forced into giving that up, without knowing if Ill ever get another chance, makes the grief even more unbearable.

Has anyone been through something similar? How do you cope when you regret your decision but cant change it? How do you grieve when no one around you acknowledges your loss?",abortion,9.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jconvm/boyfriend_forced_me_to_have_an_abortion_dumped_me/

17 days ago I had a suction abortion, I was 6 weeks so early to handle what I had to do. 

Im 31 year old and I have a son who is 10 years old. 

I have a stable and supportive relationship with my boyfriend of almost 2 years and we live together in my houseboat. 

I had the abortion because my boyfriend wasnt ready yet (he is 23) and also the thought of having a baby on board is possible but not at all ideal. 
I did what I knew was best even tho I got warm fuzzy feelings towards the idea of being pregnant and having a love baby together. 

Since Im not on birthcontrol (I tried several times but I have a lot of side effects wich I dont want to have) I asked if he would want a vesectomy (excuse my English as it isnt my language) but he doesnt want that so we agreed on condoms. 

I made him clear that I want him to take the lead and the responsibility in this since he is the one that isnt ready to have kids, pointed out where I put the new package of condoms etc (within reach) 

Today (17 days after the abortion) we had sex for the first time, you probably hear it coming already; as he started cuddling and slides it in unprotected.. even tho I did warn him several times AND told him I dont want to have had this abortion for nothing as we have the risk of getting pregnant directly. 

I did push him out eventually and he is a very supportive and good lovely guy but this action of him gave me a lot of emotions so I wanted to talk about it in this group. 
Afterwards I did confront him as well about if he did think when he just pushed it in and he said he did but couldnt resist. 

Anyway, I had to get it off my chest, I really do like the idea of having one, but here I am trying to defend his decision after all i went through with the abortion 17 days ago wich I didnt took lightly& ",abortion,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jb6o8s/sharing_thoughts/

2025-03-15,1742062747.0,Confused on logic and rights,"I recently did a deep dive and it left me confused. My issue is that I still don't have a genuine grasp on the logistics behind PL. I understand that PL views every fetus as a full-blown person with rights. However, rights come with the clause of not being able to take away someone else's rights no matter how small they seem in comparison. This should extend to the fetus if they are a full-blown human. That is where my logic leads me. Even if we take away the status of human with rights leaving them with just human life, the PP can still use their bodily autonomy to remove it. 


Furthermore, it's not the fetuses fighting against abortion it is born people. It's people with peens and uterus. By taking away one uterus owner's bodily autonomy you take away all bodily autonomy for current and future uterus owners. That is what having equal rights is about no matter how big or small the person is their rights are equal. If you give yourself the right to decide on someone else's behalf the same can be said in reverse. You cause a car accident and you're the perfect match for the person who got hurt you can and will be forced to save them. I understand being morally against something but you can't turn it into legislation that takes away rights from people currently alive and future generations. Jehovah's Witnesses don't believe in blood transfusions but they don't turn it into legislation because not everyone believes what they do and they would be taking away people's RTL. This is where my logic leads.  


In contrast, the PC logic seems streamlined to me. You have the right to bodily autonomy meaning you control what happens to or inside your body. If you end up pregnant and don't want to be you have the right to end that pregnancy. You end up pregnant and you want it congratulations hope you enjoy the journey. When applying the fetus has rights, not much changes. You end up pregnant and don't want to be, it's in your body and it can't take away your right to keep itself alive nor can any born person. You end up pregnant and you want it congrats on the pregnancy. It's beginning to feel more and more like your rights matter as long as there isn't a fetus involved.

2025-03-15,1742070086.0,"Do Women Have a Moral Duty to Keep Their Bodies ""Ready"" for Reproduction at All Times?","Late last year, Dr. Rebecca Gomperts (Aid Access, Women on Waves) announced results of a large clinical trial in Moldova, testing the use of a weekly low dose of mifepristone (50 mg) as a contraceptive. The results were promising, with only one pregnancy occurring within 2000 cycles. Furthermore, negative side effects were minimal, with only 4% of the participants experiencing any negative side effects (compared to a 40% negative side effect rate for conventional hormonal contraceptives). Additionally, the low-dose mifepristone was easier to use, requiring only one dose a week, and being more ""forgiving"" of variations in the time the pill is taken. And 89% of the study participants reported that they stopped menstruating while taking mifepristone as a contraceptive. (Probably most women would consider this a positive side effect.)

Because of the positive results, the trials have been expanded to the Netherlands this year. If the results continue to be positive, the plan is to apply to the European Medicines Agency for registration and market authorization to allow this weekly, low-dose mifepristone regimen as a contraceptive throughout the EU.

The method of action for mifepristone as birth control is two-fold: it reduces the rate of ovulation and it thins the endometrial lining of the uterus, making it impossible for a fertilized egg to implant.

([Source](https://msmagazine.com/2025/01/07/mifepristone-weekly-contraceptive-clinical-trials-abortion-pill-birth-control/).)

My primary question for PL supporters is this: 

* Would you have any moral or legal objections to women's use of such a contraceptive? If so, on what grounds?

Here are some secondary questions if you believe that the use of this contraceptive would be immoral:

* If a woman was taking mifepristone as described here *as a contraceptive* and informed her partner that she was doing this before they had sex, and if her partner, knowing this, decided to go ahead and have PIV sex with her, and if one of his sperm fertilized an egg but it failed to implant, whose would be the primary responsibility for the ""death"" of the fertilized egg? (Realistically, neither of them would ever know if this happened, so this is a hypothetical question.)
* *Men's* use of tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, red meat, and food high in trans fats during the months before their partners' conception is associated with higher miscarriage rates, because of these substances' impacts on sperm. ([Source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/a-mans-unhealthy-lifestyle-too-can-lead-to-his-partners-pregnancy-loss/articleshow/64072130.cms?from=mdr).)  If men engage in such unhealthy lifestyles, they are not maintaining their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction, and their choices could result in the ""death"" of a fertilized egg or even an embryo or fetus.

2025-03-13,1741895127.0,Symptoms literally ALL. OVER. THE. PLACE.,"Alright, y'all -- I'm pregnant for the third time (7 weeks 1 day today) and let me tell you, my symptoms are ALL. OVER. THE. PLACE. 

My previous two pregnancies were both so textbook-like: nausea and super crazy exhaustion starting in 1st trimester, both symptoms pretty much gone near the end of 1st trimester. Not much craziness for symptoms besides that. Both pregnancies previously were boys (now 3 &amp; 5 years old). The only main difference is that with my first pregnancy, my morning sickness wore off each day around dinner time (what a blessing!), but with my second pregnancy, I was pretty much just nauseous 24/7. =.=¨

But this pregnancy?? This pregnancy... I'm sometimes tired, sometimes EXHAUSTED, sometimes nauseous, random times of day it comes and goes, also random pains and cramps at different parts of my abdomen (mostly on the right but occasionally on the left) that also come and go...just...!? And earlier on it was lots of bloating and constipation and gas and sometimes also heartburn and now I also get bursts of mom rage but really I just feel SO all over the place. =

People I've talked to are like ""oh, it's a girl"" = which maybe it is since my boy pregnancies were both so similar and predictable but this one is so all over the place and unpredictable so far. I know you can't really predict that, but I can't help but laugh at how many people have said that to me?! Like, what?? Haha.

Also my sister had fraternal twins during her 3rd pregnancy and I'm 34 and in my 3rd pregnancy so I can't help but wonder if I'm having twins?! I'll find out next week at my first checkup (just 6 more days!) but it's definitely been on my mind.

Not looking for predictions or anything, mostly just wondering there are any other mamas out there who have had similar situations, with crazy symptoms all over the place? Even if you haven't been pregnant before your current pregnancy. Maybe this can just be a safe place for us to rant about symptoms being so random, unpredictable, and all over the place. >à

In your experience, is it worth it, does it increase stress and costs unnecessarily, and does it push for interventions that aren't needed/scans that end up getting false positives? 

I'm labeled high risk at 39 as a FTM who conceived through IVF (unexplained, but very likely cervical issues). I agreed to MFM care in my first trimester because I was struggling with anxiety and happy for any additional assuring appointments. But at 22 weeks, anxiety is gone and everything is going perfectly with me and baby. I have a baby echocardiogram scheduled for 3 weeks from now, and apparently I'd start to see MFM every 2 weeks (!!) not long after that, in addition to all my OB appointments. 

I spoke with my normal GP today, who specializes in women's reproductive health, and she strongly recommended I consider bowing out of MFM care. This is given my zero indicated risk and the high likelihood that they would induce me (they told me they'd induce me before my due date) and overall push for scans and tests that often give false positives. 

She said MFM really pushes for babies to be born alive and early (pushing induction) vs. thinking about the baby's overall start in life (being able to nurse, breathe well, fight infection, etc). She sees the difference in newborn response and overall health whereas MFM and OB don't treat babies after birth, and the differences she sees between babies born 36-39 weeks vs. 40-41 weeks (especially for healthy women who eat, move, and have supportive communities) is huge. 

It's got me thinking! Anyone else avoid MFM or even extra OB intervention to avoid induction or being pressured toward induction (or just lots of expensive appointments/scans that aren't needed)?

Resembling the effects of eugenics, it reflects a societal bias against disabilities, effectively ""weeding out"" a specific genetic trait.

Eugenics per wikipedia: is a set of beliefs and practices that aim to improve the genetic quality of a human population -&gt;This in itself seems a good ""improving genetic quality of the human population""

Eugenics is stigmatized due to the racist evils of Nazi Germany, but it's goal of improving a populations health and other desirable characteristics is not evil in it's self.

It will obviously need to be controlled but once we can select and screen fetuses and embryos for positive characteristics such as good health (e.g. not having mental or physical illnesses), long life, physical strength, intelligence that will improve society we should and it can be argued it would be immoral to the next generation not to do so e.g. we are treating them poorly

Once genetic selection becomes  a societal norm similar to  how immunizing a child is expected today, It will be seem negligent to opt out, much like skipping vaccines is viewed now.

  
TLDR:  
Downs syndrome screening is eugenics "" a set of beliefs and practices that aim to improve the genetic quality of a human population"".  
This itself is a good and is tainted by a history of racism and discrimination which doesn't need to apply to eugenics in future. Though obvious caution and safeguards should be applied

However, should l be worried? l do have the typical symptons (no vomiting though) and l think my ovultion might have been very late.

2025-03-13,1741893655.0,PL for religious reasons - why are your churchs teachings on reproductive rights the 100% absolute truth?,"One of the biggest arguments that I see PL make is that the Bible says abortion is wrong &amp; it goes against Christian values. Faith is not something I particularly relate to, but I do think it can be comforting and deeply personal. In fact, I think its admirable that people can so strongly believe in something that there is not necessarily physical evidence of - I am truly happy for all who find comfort in it.

My question is: why do you feel that your denominations abortion beliefs is correct and above all others?

There are 6 main branches of Christianity &amp; all of them have varying beliefs on abortion. Many protestant denominations are not only pro-choice, but actively advocate for womens reproductive rights. About 60% of Catholics are pro-choice, despite the churchs view on it. 40% of Evangelical Protestants support abortion in cases of rape &amp; 51% are in support for medical reasons. The Mormon, Episcopal, Methodist &amp; Southern Baptist churches support abortion in cases of rape &amp; medical reasons. 

Of course we also need to recognize that many Christian denominations are against it. I am not denying that. But even the churchs messaging is more empathetic &amp; does not include the typical you opened your legs, deal with it sentiment I see from a lot of PL Christians. For example, Pope Francis, who is against abortion, recognizes and advocates for more support for women seeking an abortion, such as grace, community and love. The Baptist Churchs stance preaches the need for access to contraception, community support &amp; financial help. They also acknowledge the complexity of abortion, and even stated this: We acknowledge that we often lack compassion, insight &amp; the necessary commitment to serve our Christian community. We affirm our commitment to &. maintain fellowship with those whose opinions differ from ours and extend the compassion of Christ to all. 

So PL Christians, why are you so adamant that your denominations teachings are correct? Why is whatever your pastor says the 100% absolute truth? Are those who take a more liberal stance not a true Christian and if so, why do you think you or your church has the right to decide what makes someone a real Christian?

How do you justify the contradictions in the Bible? There is not a soul on earth who can never sin, even the Bible says so. Why is abortion one of the worst sins, if all sins are equal? Why do you choose that abortion is wrong, but ignore the part about loving thy neighbor and not judging? Why are you a better Christian than your neighbor who attends a more liberal church down the street?

Thank you in advance - I see a lot of points on the PL side, but this is one that I just really dont comprehend so I appreciate all of the insight! ",Abortiondebate,40.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jak9lk/pl_for_religious_reasons_why_are_your_churchs/

My (now) ex-boyfriend pressured me into having an abortion, making me feel like I had no choice. The concerns over the extent of his forcefulness &amp; controlling behaviour were also logged at the time by the medical professionals at the abortion clinic. Two days later, he dumped me over text, told me he never wants to have children with me completely cut me off, and within two weeks, he was posting date night pictures with someone new, as I lay in bed still recovering physically &amp; mentally. He has a narcissistic mother that also blocked me on the day of my surgery and never even acknowledged that I was pregnant. Its just them two, his father is not around &amp; has a completely new family. Its like they both erased me and my baby overnight.

The worst part isI regret it. I didnt want to go through with it, but I was made to feel like I had no choice. I would cancel consultations until he noticed I was doing that so he would start driving me there, I couldnt take the preparation pill for hours but the amount of force I had received, it made me feel like I would be in serious danger if I kept my baby. Now, Im left with this overwhelming grief that I dont know how to process. I feel like a part of me is missing, and I dont know if Ill ever forgive myself. Its hard to function normally when the pain is this heavy. Its been 3 weeks now and I havent eaten a full meal since the day before the surgery, Im signed off work due to my mental health, I dont have any friends as he completely isolated me, and I get no more than 3 hours sleep a night. 

What makes this even harder is that just 10 days before I conceived, I was told I was infertile. Because of my PCOS, one of my ovaries no longer works, and I was led to believe that getting pregnant naturally would be nearly impossible for me. So when I found out I was pregnant, it felt like a miraclesomething I never thought Id get the chance to experience. And now, knowing that I was forced into giving that up, without knowing if Ill ever get another chance, makes the grief even more unbearable.

I think I am 4 weeks along after checking a few calculators online (first day of last period was Feb 10).  The symptoms I noticed about a week ago was sore boobs which only seem to be getting worse, and some tiredness here and there. Yesterday though, an hour after I ate my lunch, I got a sudden bout of nausea and thought I was going to vomit immediately. It came out of nowhere and honestly scared me and my body went into a flight/fight reaction, where suddenly I felt sick all over and thankfully didn't puke but I had to poop a few times and felt nauseous for many hours.  I also felt lightheaded the majority of the day but I assume it's because I didn't eat nearly as much as I normally would and I expelled everything out the other end lol.

I eventually got hungry again, about 5 hours later, and ate a handful of walnuts which made my stomach hurt.  Then about 2 hours after that I had a quesadilla and fiesta potatoes from Taco Bell which went down well, but I got a slight tummy ache again and just felt ""bleh"" and lethargic.  Woke up today feeling much better but had another bathroom trip which was rather unpleasant.

I do have IBS and have always had issues here and there with my stomach. I of course always worried that I would be absolutely terrible when pregnant and now I'm freaking out a bit because it's SO early in the pregnancy that I shouldn't be nauseous from it already...

I know these are similar to regular pregnancy symptoms, but theyre mainly concerning to me since I didnt have it with my first and its new to me. Thankfully I havent had much swelling, and my blood pressure is normal (so far). I ordered an at-home blood pressure monitor for peace of mind, but I know sometimes blood pressure doesnt always spike for those with pre-eclampsia. 

For those of you who had it, what symptoms did you experience (if any) that made you realize you had it, and how early into your pregnancy did you figure it out? Thanks much in advance! :) ",pregnant,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jbegqu/what_were_your_first_signs_of_preeclampsia/

2025-03-14,1741988561.0,"""Pretending"" to be PL, do I pass?","I almost wanted to make this post from an anonymous account to really make this a more authentic thought experiment but felt like that would be a pushing if not trampling sub rules so doing it like this instead. I'm tagging it as ""question for PL"" as its mostly aimed there, but there are a couple things for PC as well.

**What I want to do:** 

I will present a stance and arguments as if I am PL. I will do so to the best of my ability, providing multiple of the most reasonable arguments I know of. I won't go ham on ALL details, but enough as to get the gist of the reasons behind my pretend stance. It will still be in my own ""voice"" as a debatee though, and will not use arguments that I find completely bogus (religious, consent to sex is consent to pregnancy, appeal to nature, etc). So don't hold that against me. After I will ask a few questions. Keep in mind that that the idea of the post is not necessarily in the arguments I'm presenting themselves but more in my (and by extension other PC with similar view points) ability to understand the PL view. So here goes:

**The argument:**

During fertilization, a unique entity with human DNA is created. The exact point as to when this entity should legally become a person is hard to pin point as it can change due to technology and is subject to a lot of semantic and philosophical ideas regarding personhood and law. So, my go to is to err on the side of caution and say that it should be treated as a legal person from the moment its existence is known, i.e. fertilization. This seems as the more morally sensible choice as it is better to err on the side of giving the entity more rights, that of a legal person, rather than less and risk being in the moral wrong later.

From there, since we are talking about a person with the same rights as others. This includes the right to life, which should ensure that a person is not deprived of their life, or any other right, for that matter without due process. When abortions are legal, a female person is able for any reason kill the fetus, and thus taking away their right to life without due process. Although we allow killing in self defense, even after the incident is done there would be an investigation to determine if the lethal measure was justified. This happens whenever any person is killed. Without banning abortion, this investigation would never happen, and since I think there are times in which an abortion is an unjustified use of lethal force, it should in fact occur.

So, abortion should be banned with exceptions so that it is only used in certain cases where lethal force is justified. Specifically, when there is a particular medical reason that can be named by a doctor for having the abortion outside of that from ""normal pregnancy symptoms"". This is also in part because the fetus it self has done nothing wrong, as it is incapable of having intent and acting on it. As such, it would be a moral and legal wrong for them to be killed when they have not committed a crime. Although having the female person carry the pregnancy to term may have adverse affects for them, it is a greater wrong for the law to allow a person to be killed when they could have otherwise lived.

Although forcing female people to gestate against their will may be unfortunate as a side effect, the law should err on the side of keeping persons alive in this case. Especially since unlike organ donation they are forcing inaction, rather than forcing a procedure. The female could be compensated and their struggles alleviated, weather they be social, financial or otherwise, using other government programs instead of allowing them to kill the person causing them.

It is not ideal, but it is the better status quo than persons being killed for unjustifiable reasons without due process. As a society, we should strive for the over all well being of everybody, and killing a person who has done nothing wrong goes against that. Everybody deserves a chance at life unless there are severe extenuating circumstances and in vast majority of cases, a pregnancy by it self does not constitute those.

**The questions, geared toward PL:**

1. If you are PL, if you read this without knowing I am PC, would you believe I am PL? As in, do you believe I represented  your views and arguments, or at least ones close to your stance justifiably? If no, what did I miss or what gives me away?

2. If you answered yes to 1, then lets go back to the fact that I AM vehemently, no restrictions PC. Considering I, supposedly, understand and know your arguments enough to present them in a way you find acceptable, why do you think that is?

3. Are you in response, regardless of how ""accurate"" you think my ""post"" is able to provide a counter argument as if you are PC? If you do so, do you feel like you would be able to ""pass"" as a PC? Feel free to attempt to do so as answer to this question as well.

**More questions, geared towards PC:**

1. Do you think I ""pass"" as PL? If not could you do better and where?

2. If a PL person demonstrated the same amount of understanding of the PC stance as I have demonstrated about PL, why do you think they are still PL? (This is meant to be a mirror of question 2 for the PL, sorry for the weird wording)

**Both can answer:**

If you were to guess, who do you think would do better at this ""pretend to be the other side"" exercise, PL or PC? And I don't mean by completely lying and using arguments one completely doesn't see the reasoning behind or imitating some voice or other but genuinely trying to make the argument for the other side like a devils advocate?",Abortiondebate,28.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jbf6um/pretending_to_be_pl_do_i_pass/

2025-03-14,1741960587.0,Kind of traumatizing doctors visit,"Is this normal?

I went in for my regular 4 week visit yesterday at 22w4d. This was only my second visit at this office, since I moved mid-pregnancy. The nurse took my blood pressure and it was slightly elevated. I let them know that I do get nervous for visits (on top of that they rush you into the back, have you pee, weigh you, then try to have a full conversation with you and then take your blood pressure). My first visit at the office, 4 weeks ago, my blood pressure was elevated the first time they took it, I think like 150/80. After sitting there for about a minute, they retook it and it dropped to 132/82. I told them my normal blood pressure, before pregnancy was about 120/80. Yesterday, the first time they took it my BP was 153/87 and then they retook it about a minute later and it was 147/83. I know these are elevated blood pressures, but I did not expect what happened next. The midwife comes into the room, we've never met her before and met with a different midwife 4 weeks ago. The first thing she says to us is ""we're sending you to triage"". My husband and I had no idea what she meant, this is our first pregnancy. I honestly thought she was joking because of how cut and dry she said it. She then told me that my BP is so concerning and saying all of these things to me that are instantly terrifying me. We have had a completely healthy pregnancy so far, with zero complications, so this came as such a shock. She was so harsh about the way she was saying things. We had previously expressed that we wanted a natural birth in their birthing center, she starts telling us that this is all at risk and that we need to make sacrifices and ""that's just how parenthood is"". We were completely shocked and scared with the way that she was talking. She didn't even ask us if we have any questions or anything, just told us the directions to OB triage at the hospital. When we got to the hospital they took my blood and had me pee in a cup and explained that they would take my blood pressure every 15 minutes for 2 hours. They wanted to check for early markers of preeclampsia. We met the triage midwife who was much nicer and well spoken. When the 2 hours was up, they prescribed me a low dose of labetalol. All of my blood tests came back negative for preeclampsia. I have no protein in my pee. The only thing going on is an elevated blood pressure. 

I guess I just want to hear from others if this is a normal thing to be sent to triage for or if it seems like an over reaction from the midwife? Also am I completely screwed from having a natural birth? Am I going to get preeclampsia no matter what?? I feel like I left with so many questions and overall just so nervous and scared. What would've been a 30 minute doctors office turned into us at the doctors/ hospital for over 3 hours.

Currently 12+4 with our < post IVF loss at 12+5 March of last year. As you can imagine Im struggling mentally and emotionally as the sense of loss never really goes away but of course grateful for this spontaneous pregnancy after TTC for 4yrs.

Starting Monday this week my nausea has essentially disappeared, breasts tender but not near as sore as they have consistently been. Im tired, and feel more bloated than normal.

2025-03-13,1741908318.0,Is It even possible to find the overall Better objective solution to abortion issues?,"A thing that i notice in so many abortion discussions Is that, usually, the best solution to abortion issues end up being Just subjective to the individual view on the matter. At the same Time through, most of abortion issues originate from the ethicality of It, which can't be completely objective because good and evil are overall subjective. Considering this, i think that the best overall ""objective"" solution to abortion issues would be a solution that wouldn't overall discriminately attack the fetus and/or the mother. The question is if It can actually be resolved in a way that would be found by the most amount possible of people as acceptable. We could try, like It Is done in many other ethical issues, to make a conclusion based on whenever or not human rights are respected in the situation. If we theorically consider fetuses as human lives(this statement Is found by overall most biologists as true based on multiple surveys such as the biomed One or others), then the killing of the human being would be considered as Murder as long as It Is premediated and unjustificate. In the law, with some excemption, Murder Is usually Only justificate if It Is done in self defense.

2025-03-14,1741991016.0,"My husband wants more kids, are my conditions unreasonable?","When I met my husband I was a fence sitter. Over time I warmed up the idea and decided Id be okay with one baby. Husband wanted three, but was glad I was open to one. We got married and after a year of trying I got pregnant with my little girl who is due in June.

Now tell me why this man is watching me suffer and is already talking about a second baby??
We had discussed right before I got pregnant that I MIGHT do two, but we dont know what pregnancy and parenthood will be like and Im not rushing to make that decision before we see what life is like with a baby.

He keeps saying the baby needs a sibling and he really wants a boy and a girl. I thought on it and decided under certain conditions I could be open to one more, definitely not three.

My conditions: 
1. We must be comfortable with the political and economical climate at the time specifically in regard to womens rights and maternal rights.

2. After breast feeding husband pays for a breast lift and tummy tuck if needed.

3. He must be okay with stopping at 2 even if we have another daughter. By stopping at 2 I mean he will get a vasectomy.

Husband is willing to accept 1-2 and says even if its another girl hed gladly stop at 2 babies so she can have a sibling. 

However, he says he will not get a vasectomy. I explained in detail how its reversible and much safer than me getting my tubes tied. He insists we can continue to use condoms and plan B as needed. I told him currently in the USA they are working to ban birth control, abortion, and plan b and we will have no fall back if I get pregnant at 40 which we both agree we wouldnt want another kid at that age.

Is this unreasonable? He says he doesnt want to mess with his downstairs and I rolled my eyes and reminded him what Im doing to my body for us to have a child.

My husband has been kind and taken good care of me through this, but I feel Ive compromised a lot and met him half way on our ideals with what our family will be like. Is a vasectomy really asking too much??

Edit: Id like to point out as there seems to be some confusion. Id never force my husband to have a vasectomy. Its simply a condition if he wants a second child which is something he wants.

2025-03-15,1742042389.0,Anyone else have found ligament pain like this?,hi im 21(f) 24w pregnant today! and around 10:30pm last night i started to have some sharp pain in the lower left side of my belly while wandering target. It wasnt too bad but quickly progressed and by the time i got home i was bent over in pain and could barely walk. I got a warm compress and laid down as i wasnt bleeding and didnt need to use the restroom per se. It helped for a bit but around 4am it had gotten bad again to where i could barely get out of bed and if i even dared lay on my left side i was in teeth grinding pain. So my S.O. took me to the E.R and they took me to labor and delivery (this wasnt my usual doctor bc shes on maternity leave currently). They said its too early for a stress test which is fine took a urine sample and put some monitors on for a bit. Monitors all looked great and no contractions or protein in urine (not sure if they tested for any UTI or not) and sent me on my way saying its probably just baby growing. This is my first time so i was just wondering if this is normal or has been the same experience for anyone else? Should i get a second opinion? Does this seem like round ligament pain?

(advice please),"Ill start this by saying I know Ill get the judgement so harshly, but do know that everyone isnt just going into the activity everyday with the same mood and feeling (aka. sex). At this point in time, Ive had two abortions. The first time was simply my first time ever getting pregnant and i wasnt even sure if I was able to. Plus the events around the first time made the choice easier. The second time, it was more so realizing this full situation Im in and Id possibly be in if I had the child. I was still stressing and this time the choice was a little bit more difficult than before because I felt that maybe it wouldnt be that bad, but then again this shouldnt have happened twice. I had more feelings the second time as well. I went outside and just let loose. The way I was reacting had me questioning myself, but I was told those feeling were normal when I went the first time. Difference was I didnt feel anything the first time. Now Im pregnant again, but I have different feelings. I know I dont want my baby in a bad environment, especially school. I dont even want to be here when I have children. But Im not sure if I can do this a third time&.

Thank god I am not someone who gets super anxious when kiddo cries (17mo) but I can tell it definitely irritates some doctors or makes them uncomfortable at least.

I use a convertible push bike (imagine stroller.. but mini bike) because its way more lightweight and so much easier than taking and putting away a stroller, I bring drinks and snacks, occasionally a toy but I will also give screen time on my phone if it's an emergency - on top of all of that I have a super chill kid, and I mean he only fusses when he's hungry, needs a diaper change, or we have been somewhere for entirely WAY too long.. yet I am still so burnt out by the end of these appointments..

I cannot even imagine what things are gonna be like with two when my husband goes back to work (luckily we have a big backyard, as well as a mini playground back there, an actual playground only a block away - so I won't have to actually take them places for awhile) but I am so envious of those cool, chill moms who have everything under control =-=-",pregnant,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jc7sl7/how_are_we_doing_high_risk_pregnancies_with_a/

2025-03-14,1741963333.0,Positive MA experience - 10w 0d,"Using a throwaway for this one just in case. Although every MA is different, I want to share my story in hopes it will help others in a similar situation.

I discovered I was pregnant on Feb 26th; I'd had what I thought was a light period on January 29th-30th-31st, but it turns out that must have been implantation bleeding. I thought I was only 10 days late for my period based on the timing of that bleed, but it turns out I was much further along. I hadn't had many symptoms except for very sore breasts, some tiredness and loss of appetite, all of which I tend to get before my cycle anyway, so I didn't clue in right away.

I'm in a solid, loving relationship, but we just aren't currently in a situation to add to our family. I have a young child from my previous relationship, and we live in a fairly modest apartment, and for many other reasons it just wouldn't be right to add to the family right now. 

I was a bit panicked when I found out I was pregnant, but my partner was incredibly supportive and understanding. I called my doctor the same day and was referred to our local hospital which has a program for women seeking termination. My partner brought me to the appointment, which was on Wednesday of this week. I'm based in Canada and so it was a very calm and non-judgmental environment; I'm grateful to the doctor and nurse who walked me through my options and explained everything to me.

I was given an ultrasound and blood test the same day and they determined I was at exactly 10 weeks and 0 days, the cutoff for using medical termination in my province. They mentioned I could either schedule a surgical termination for the following week, or do the medical termination as long as I was willing to take the first pill that day. I decided on the medical because I wanted to end the pregnancy as soon as possible - my last pregnancy and birth process were extremely traumatic, and being pregnant again was giving me nightmares and flashbacks, so I couldn't handle the thought of waiting any longer.

Timeline:

6:00 pm Wednesday: took the mifepristone dose as directed. Had some very mild cramping starting about two hours later, which continued the following day.

1:00 pm Thursday: developed a headache, had some additional cramping and mildly upset stomach through the rest of the afternoon.

6:00 pm: took 10 mg ketorolac with a small amount of food.

6:45 pm: took 4 Misoprostol tablets in the cheek for 30 minutes as directed, washed down with water afterwards.

9:00 pm: started having some mild cramping which came in waves, slight chills. Very mild nausea which didn't last. Watched TV with partner and just tried to relax.

10:00 pm: started having some light spotting, cramps continuing. Cramps felt like my worst period day, nothing too major. Chills and started to have diarrhea.

10:45 pm: listened to an audiobook and went to sleep.

11:30 pm: woke up to a strange sensation, felt almost like my hands weren't attached to my body. Felt something shift in my lower abdomen, then a rush of fluid. Fortunately I was wearing heavy duty period undies in addition to a pad already and had no leakage. Went to the bathroom expecting pure blood but discovered it was pink tinted fluid which I assume was water breaking. Pad completely saturated. Pain very minimal.

As soon as I sat down on the toilet I felt something drop out. Had the sensation of needing to push, did so and a much larger clump came rushing out, along with quite a bit of blood. Peeked into the toilet and could see a ring shaped clot, and noticed a light pink thing partially submerged in the blood. It was not pleasant to see and I could tell it was part of a leg/lower torso of the embryo, extremely small but unmistakable.

Had a bit of a cry. Said I was sorry. Remembered what some of the other women have said on here about their babies becoming part of the water. I did not want to be pregnant, but I couldn't help but have feelings about it. I stayed for a while before saying goodbye and flushing.

1:30 am: woke up again, mild cramping and passed some more clots. Took a second ketorolac. Came back to bed and fell asleep easily.

6:00 am: woke up at my normal time, immediately felt different than I'd been feeling for the last few weeks. Breasts still a little sore but pain noticeably reduced from how they had been feeling prior. Did not have the morning upset stomach, and was able to enjoy a coffee (I'd been having aversion to it for about three weeks). Actually had energy as opposed to feeling extremely fatigued. Had moderate amount of blood on the pad and a few tiny clots when going to the bathroom, similar to a day 2 period.

10:30 am (present): cramps have almost completely subsided, have not needed more ketorolac. Ate some breakfast. Still have what is similar to a day 2 period. Energy is much higher than it normally is at this time of the morning.

I will still need to monitor for unusual bleeding, signs of infection, or increasing pain, and will need a follow up to confirm everything has passed, but ultimately the process was not what I expected. I originally worried that 4 Misoprostol wouldn't be sufficient, given that I was 10 weeks along and I've seen stories on here of women needing double the dose. I was worried it wasn't working initially as it took quite some time for the bleeding to start.

For anyone facing this situation right now: just know that you aren't alone. You are doing what is best for your body, and if you aren't ready to give up everything for a baby it means you're doing the right thing for your baby too.

Second one was MMC and found through ultrasound at 8.5 weeks. Opted for D&amp;C as I couldnt go through the pain of miscarrying at home.

Unfortunately my provider moved out of insurance network and the new provider is not ready to see me for ultrasound untill 9 weeks coz im a new patient.

Now that Im pregnant I really want to stick to that. My only indulgence before pregnancy was drinking coffee and coke, but I completely quit. I would only drink soda on the weekends anyways and eat out with my boyfriend for 1 meal (and it normally comes from a restaurant, so 2 meals a week not from home). 

I have a friend whos pregnant right now too and her whole pregnancy she follows no restrictions at all and I dont judge her for that. They drink coffee and soda every single day, eat fast food whenever they want. Sugar and sweets. I never said anything to her about it, because its her pregnancy and her life! Now that Im pregnant she is being sooo weird about how I eat?! I dont know if its making her feel guilty for the way she eats on a daily. Because it feels like Im being shunned by her for the way that I eat. God forbid I cook myself healthy meals !?! She says just drink soda and coffee, its a myth that caffeine does anything to a baby, just drink water to balance it out. Then she sends me a tiktok of a pregnant girl saying  when youre pregnant youll never want to eat a homecooked meal only fast food or takeout or anything trashy and quotes it saying facts.

I have a history of bleeding suddenly during sex but it has been gone since a few months and during pregnancy its been gone altogether. 

Obviously Im scared, but also trying to downplay it to myself since I've had this issue before pregnancy, but then the final conclusion was that I probably have weak uterus lining. However shouldnt then the mucus plug not keep that stuff inside?
Or could the tissue-like pieces have been my mucus plug, which came out because of the sex and releasing the blood? I'm so scared!

I obviously called my midwife right away when this happened, but she couldnt really tell me anything other than having to wait for whether the bleeding will continue and have certainty during the planned ultrasound on Tuesday.

I'm cautiously excited to be potentially having a baby either way, I've just become sort of fixated on the numbers of it all since I won't be going for my first appointment for another few weeks.

2025-03-13,1741908477.0,PH to BKK Experience (Klongtun Hospital),"Hello everyone! I just wanted to share my experience getting an MVA (Manual Vacuum Aspiration) from Klongtun Hospital in Thailand. 


So on February 2024, I found out I was around 4-5 weeks pregnant. At that time I was thinking about ordering pills from WOW and doing the Pill Method instead, but since reading reviews that shipping could take quite a while, my boyfriend and I decided to go to Thailand instead. 


Before the trip and procedure, I talked to Jenny from Klongtun on Line. She gave me the options they had and the price list for all the procedure and the room rates, she also explained what to expect before the procedure (all the lab test and etc). So eventually I booked a slot for March 14 and she gave me an appoinment card. 


Fast forward to March 14, my boyfriend and I took an early morning flight from Manila to Bangkok after everything we checked in our hotel first and had late lunch, eventually we arrived at Klongtun Hospital at around 3:50 PM. 


This was how the process went for me:
- I showed them my appointment card then they quickly asked for my passport and 500thb (cash) for the ultrasound. 

- After the ultrasound, I found out I was already 8 weeks pregnant. 

- I had a consultation and the doctor recommended I do the MVA method, since the whole procedure would only take 5 minutes and I just had to rest for 2-3 hours after. She quoted me 11,000thb for everything (all the tests, MVA procedure, and room fee). She also disclosed that the doctor who will be doing my procedure is male. Afterwards, I paid the 11k using my debit card. 

- After paying, I waited for a bit to do the physical exam (they measured my height, weight, blood pressure, and they cleaned my V and did a pap smear, tbh the pap smear was kind of painful, more painful than the ones I've had in Manila). 

- After the physical exam, they asked my boyfriend to wait in another building then they accompanied me to leave my stuff on the 2nd floor and then accompanied me to the 3rd floor to change to a hospital gown and remove my undies. 

- After changing to a hospital gown, they asked me to lie down first. At this point, there was another girl sleeping in the same room so I assumed I would also be resting there too. 

- After a few minutes they asked me to go to the operating room. It was quite hectic because as soon as I got there they asked me to lie down with my legs up, the nurse to my left stuck a needle on my left hand to sedate me to sleep, while the nurse to my right was measuring my blood pressure, then the nurse in front of me was cleaning my V for the procedure. I saw the male doctor walk in as well, all the nurses were female BTW. At this point, I was feeling very anxious and I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to sleep but yes I did fall asleep immediately after they sedated me. 

- After the procedure, I woke up in a different room with lots of beds but I was the only one there, and at this point the nurse in charge wouldn't let me go up to use the bathroom she just told me to rest and sleep. After a while, she did allow me to use the toilet and she said it was ok for me to use a bidet. At this time she showed me my new ultrasound and the baby was no longer there. She told me the don'ts after the procedure such as: don't drink or eat food that's too hot, don't use a hot compress but warm compress is ok, etc). She also told me that I was asleep for about an hour and a half. She also gave the medicine (ibuprofen, antibiotics, iron pills) and instructions post abortion. After that, I just changed to my clothes and used the sanitary pad they provided. 

- After I was done, I just chatted with some of the nurses they told me it was ok to eat spicy food and raw food. Just not to consume alcohol. 


*Some tips I think that would help:
- go on a weekday as the hospital is not crowded at all. 
- don't be shy to ask the hospital and doctors all your questions before and after the procedure. Based on my experience, they were very patient and answered everything for me. 
- the first few hours were painful for me (felt like really bad dysmenorrhea), but what really helped eased my cramps was doing a warm compress, emphasis on warm. I brought my own hot/cold pack and used it in the hotel. 
- be prepared for the Bangkok traffic, I thought Manila traffic was already crazy but Bangkok is on another level. Although in my opinion, the price of Grab here is better than in Manila. 
- I highly suggest doing this with someone you can trust, as the whole process is very overwhelming and honestly you will need help and assistance esp during the first few hours after the procedure.


I just wanted to share my experience for those who feel anxious about their situation now. For me, the whole experience was very comfortable and I'm glad I got the procedure and healthcare I needed without any prejudice. If you have any questions about the price of the procedure, or if you just have any questions I highly suggest messaging them directly. 

Will try to update again about the post abortion experience. So far it's been about 12 hours since and I don't feel any pain at all.

Regardless, we had been extremely careful. We used condoms every single time except LITERALLY ONCE. This was back in December. I took a pregnancy test today because I have been abnormally bloated recently and thought I should to be safe. It was positive. I have had basically no other symptoms which is wild because I now am at around 3.5 months. Obviously I am freaking out. I have always been pro choice but anti abortion if that makes sense. However I am not in a situation (life or financial) where I am ready to be a single parent, and I believe that is what would happen if I went through with this. It is crazy to me that some people try for years that want a baby and some people get pregnant by a one time fluke. Life is cruel sometimes.

. I listened to a song that is soooo good. Its called Kids only matter when their not born yet. SO TRUE! I decided to rant this because a friend of mine found out I am for abortions. HE TURNED ON ME! Wants nothing to do with me anymore. I tried explaining how I dont think its right to force children to give birth he just says ABORTIONS = MURDER And then blocked me.

Im at 32 weeks, and friends have been giving gifts and signing them Aunt. For example, they sign their name as Aunt Jane in cards to me, or with a note to baby on the inside of a book. 

No one has asked me how I feel about it, and tbh it feels weird!! I love these people, but many of them live far away, and I would call them FRIENDS, not family. Im so excited for them to meet this baby and vice versa, but I dont think they will be the babys family. 

Obviously family isnt just blood or marriage. But not every friend is family. Some friends are just friends, even if they are very good friends!

I think it bugs me because while I know they are really writing this because they feel close to me, my baby is a separate person. I want this baby to be able to have clear boundaries and expectations with adults. I want them to understand what it means to have familywhat you should be able to expect from family, and what they should be able to expect from you. Friends and family might blur together sometimes, but if someone says theyre your family, kids should be able to form ideas of what that means. And if they decide one of my friends feels like an aunt to them, or we become so interdependent with someone that they become family, then great! But thats not where we are with these folks. 

I know were some time away from these things actually becoming an issue, and that likely it will never be an issue. But some of these folks I see once every 1-3 years. I dont want to show up at their house for a visit one day and have to explain to them then that no, Im not going to tell my child to call them aunt, and they shouldnt ask for that, either. 

My husband assures me this is very far from a big deal, and I know hes right, but it just feels very intrusive. Its like the emotional equivalent of someone touching your belly without asking. I know people already love this baby, and I love that, but they are their own little person, not just an extension of me. 

I know others will likely have their own opinions here. Please feel free to share, but Id also just ask up front that you dont feel the need to say there is a right vs wrong here or try to put down the feeling that Im having.

2025-03-16,1742136839.0,Abortion is Absolutely Justified,"Premises:

1. Moral worth is based on current capacity for sentience, as **only sentient beings can experience harm**.

2. A pre-sentient fetus **lacks the ability to experience harm** and has no present interests.

3. Forcing a sentient person to remain pregnant **imposes significant physical, psychological, and emotional harm**.

4. Future potential does not create present moral worth; moral status depends on actual characteristics, **not hypothetical ones**.

5. When a **moral conflict** arises, the entity capable of experiencing harm (the pregnant person) has **greater moral weight** than a non-sentient fetus.

Conclusion:

Before fetal sentience, abortion is morally justified because **there is no meaningful harm to the fetus**, while forcing pregnancy **significantly harms a sentient person**.

Not only does this stop 100% of unintended pregnancies when used, they are perfectly safe for the AFAB person as they only attack unknown, unique human DNA. And, it's completely reversible, simply through remote control.

I dont mind typically, since I know he struggles with sleeping. However now that Im deep in the third trimester, I need him to be available. And often during the night&he isnt.

2 weeks ago, I had very bad pains for an hour that stopped me from being able to switch sides or even get out of bed. I felt like a beached whale. I tried calling him and texting him, but his phone was on do not disturb and he didnt add me as a person to get through to him when I needed to. After about 20 mins, I was able to get up and crouch my way over to the room down the hall where I angrily woke him up. Bc hes such a disturbed sleeper, he anxiously started yelling what what what! At the top of his lungs at me. I was really upset, bc I felt when I needed him around for our baby, he wasnt there. He was angry for about ten minutes that I woke him up and was grumbling about how I get to nap during the day and he doesnt, but I wasnt having any of it. Respectfully I told him to shut his mouth and do/say nothing unless its about being there for me. Im Puerto Rican and I dont play that . Turns out the baby dropped 2 centimeters!

A couple days later, Im up in the am and hes still sleeping in. My 2 40 pound dogs are on me and Im so big I cant get them off. I try calling him, since I made myself a do not disturb contact and wouldnt you know, he put on his airplane mode! So I couldnt reach him regardless. His excuse was well I went to the other room at 6 am and I figured you were up and youd be fine. Suffice it to say, I was NOT happy. I told him he cant do this, that he needs to be reachable at all times, even if Im just downstairs. 
What if I fall? What if Im in pain again and cant move? What if the dogs wont let me get up? I said if he did it again, there would be big problems.

Now today, same thing. This time, he slept in the other room all night and the dogs are crying to be walked and Im texting/calling him..his phone is off. Im trying to yell for him..but he isnt hearing me. He also planned on waking up this am to go for a quick shake out run since hes running a half marathon tmrw. His mother is landing from Minnesota in a half hour and hes not up. I made it clear that we need to turn over the guest room for her, and need to sweep downstairs. I cleaned pretty much the whole house in prep for her yesterday. Went to Costco to do my final prep run for freezer meal prep for us, so he doesnt lose his mind cooking meals and making a mess bc I wont be able to help much, AND went to his race expo with him to pick up his bib and help him navigate it. Its his first big formal race and Ive ran multiple halfs and a marathon. So wanted to show my support for him.

Why is she coming? Bc he needs to go to a work conference for a week in Utah and the only way Id let him go is if he made sure someone was with me. Bc Im always tired and always need some help.

Am I being a brat or unreasonable to want my husband to not put his need for sleep over making himself available to me in my last month of pregnancy? He is other wise a wonderful husband during the day for the most part. Helps me clean the kitchen after I cook, will do some laundry, help clean the bathroom when I ask, walk the dogs when he can etc. He can be a little selfish from time to time with his day, but who cant? 

Im just getting so annoyed that I have to keep having this convo with him and Im debating telling his mother. Although I dont know what that will do..she tends to coddle him lol. Ive done a lot of work to get him to be less coddled lol. Ive also done a lot of work to get myself to a point where I dont just pop off on him. Being a New Yorker and Latina, thats my instinct. But he doesnt respond well to that and says Im being disrespectful and wont engage with me.

Sorry for the rant everyone. Any advice? Am I being nuts? Thanks!

Update: I popped off on him via text and told him Im telling both of our parents he keeps doing this. He said sorry and that his phone gets put on airplane mode automatically and its just habit. Well it wasnt a habit when he had it on do not disturb and we got into a fight over that right? Now that I can reach him through DND, now its a years long habit lol. I just told him that the fact that he didnt make it a priority to be cognizant of before bed shows how careless and selfish hes being.  I def got tough and rude with him and he told me to stop a few times, which promptly got met with a stfu >7<ý@. Now hes up and trying to check and see if Im ok.

2025-03-15,1742030442.0,We both want abortion but my wife can't get over the fears from her beliefs. How can i help her?,"Hi guys,

I seriously need your help on this, and this is a long one.

We just got married, and we f'd up. We know this is our mistake and we are blaming ourselves for letting this happen.

My wife and I just found out she's pregnant a few days ago, just a month after our wedding. The scan we did yesterday didn't even show the embryo inside the uterus, so we still have time to decide what to do. It's very early. It's too early even to do a MA. Now our initial reaction and up to even now after a few days is that we are not ready to have kids. We still want to enjoy our lives and no matter how we go through the scenarios in our head and together, we can not imagine and cannot accept the reality that there will be a children in our life, at least at this time. We fully believe having a kid will more likely leave us with more suffering, and unhappiness. We've talked to great lengths about this and agree that we will be most happy and content with just each other.

But my wife is a firm believer in Buddhist teachings, and she believes that we'd be committing a major sin, akin to murder and she seems to be unable to overcome this to get the courage to make the final decision. And i don't know how to help her get through this. I believe that the decision we want to make will lead to less sufferings, and better for all parties involved. But I fear that if we decide to have an abortion, she will also not be happy and will be in tremendous mental pain and I don't know if she will even be able to heal from it.

We are also super torn due to the fact that other than our own selfish needs and the vision that we have for our life together, there's no other reason to have this abortion. We are happily in love, both our families are well off, incredibly kind, helpful to us and will be over the moon if we reveal to them about the pregnancy. There's no real financial strain to speak of to take care of the baby if we let this happen. In our culture people believe that having children is a blessing, so there's no chance of talking to anyone else in our families about this, because we will face massive judgements that will make it impossible to even speak about an abortion, so that leaves us alone to work this out.

I've tried to convince my wife that this is not a crime, and we are making this decision believing it will be best for our life together, that what ever is inside her right now is not yet a living human being, and if we make this decision with kindness in our hearts, there is no need to fear of guilt, karma or anything like that. But she is dismissing me everytime I mention it and doesnt want or unable to let go of her strong beliefs. I can see that she's in the middle of a crossroads and cannot find a way out that she can accept. She's in great pain, and I'm feeling it too.

We made the mistake of telling family our name idea for our son (due in July). No one likes the name and a few of my family members have sort of ruined the name for me - they think it's ""old fashioned"" and ""stupid"" and my mum has even said it reminds her of a celebrity with the same name who is a major asshole which further ruined the name for me!. I spoke with my partner about this and we spent a while looking at other name ideas. We kept disagreeing on every name that we found, but we did eventually find one that we both like. The issue is my partner still prefers the original name we had chosen and thinks it's special because we've been calling him that name the whole time.

2025-03-14,1741989280.0,Im losing my mind,"This past week has been a nightmare. First day of LMP was 1/8, I have PCOS so I may have missed a cycle. Got a positive digital on Saturday 3/8. For a few days prior and after I was having light spotting. Some light pink but mostly light brown with very dark brown thick, stringy, bouncy clots occasionally. Called OB, nurse said to go the ER. ER detected no intrauterine pregnancy with an HCG in the 200s. Also detected 3.6cm cyst on left ovary. They diagnosed me with a miscarriage.

Cut to calling the nurse to let her know the diagnosis and schedule a follow up. I had my follow up yesterday on 3/12. They gave me an ultrasound and again, no signs of intrauterine pregnancy. Cyst had shrunk slightly to 3.2cm. They took my blood again and I got the results today.

HCG is now 513. Completely baffled by this, I call the OB and speak with the nurse. She says she suspects that I am still pregnant just very early and thats why nothing is showing on US.

I am so confused. I was pregnant, not pregnant and pregnant again within 6 days. I had already started grieving the loss. Now Im in a state of depressive shock until I know for sure. They scheduled me for another US on 3/31. I cant wait that long. I need to know. Something doesnt feel right. I have symptoms, breast tenderness, heartburn when lying down. But there is this emptiness in my uterus but also feels tight with little bubbles. Almost exactly the feeling right before a period floods.

We love eachother but weve only been together 1.5yrs and dont even live together yet. Weve talked about kids in vague terms as something we could possibly both see for ourselves if our relationship continues as it has been (maybe in the next 3 years kinda thing). Cut to yesterday, when Im peeing into a cup after what turns out to have been days of implantation cramps. Ive been on the pill for over half my life, so it was a total shock when I saw a positive result yesterday.

Although Weve both expressed there are a lot of things we would prefer to have happened before this step, my bf is supportive of my choice no matter what, and will rise to the occasion if I decide to continue the pregnancy.

We both have good jobs, we make good money in volatile albeit hot industries. My bf is new in his role, has some debt and has far less savings and security than me. I know people make it work with far less than us, but I dont necessarily feel like that means we should rush into this. 

Having kids has always been a well see thing, at the back of my mind, because Ive prioritized career stuff until now. I thought that Id eventually go off the pill and see what happens when I felt ready. Ive prepared myself for a future where its too late or not in the cards. But I never prepared myself for jumping right to the getting pregnant part. On one hand, I dont know if Im ready for my life to completely change.

2025-03-16,1742127558.0,Post MA and I feel hopeless,"(Throwaway account! Sorry, english is not my first language, pardon my grammar lapses)

Had a successful MA yesterday. Process only took me 4 hours to pass my precious angel. The procedure didnt go very well and heres the context.

March 14,2025
- I asked my live-in partner if he can take a day off this weekend to help me with my MA. I explained and said sorry in advance if I ever sound demanding as this procedure is mentally and emotionally draining for me. He said yes, assured me that he would be there. I already took mifepristone at 11:30am. 
- Later that afternoon, he asked permission if he can report work to fulfill his duties as it was critical for him to decline (hes an engineer and I cant really understand how does his workload looks like on a daily basis) that he also needs to work on Sunday for rotational work. I also told him that I may not understand his workload, but I understand that he needs to focus at work, but the stress hes giving me is just unnecessary.
- As a response, I lashed out on him, voicing out my frustrations and he took it negatively and broke up with me as I was affecting his career.
- At that time, I was really disappointed that he cant fulfill his words.
- ADDITIONAL CONTEXT: 2024 I was at the hospital cause Im about to give birth to our first born, he left me at the hospital for the same reason.. WORK.. that they are understaffed and no one will shoulder his workload. My doctors and midwife even spoke to him to straighten up his priorities as Im in active labor, that they cant proceed with anything unless theres a guardian that can accommodate them if something happens to me, but ofc, as usual, he was really firm with his decision to prioritize his work over his partner. Im new in town and I barely even have friends to ask help with.

March 15 
- at 11:30am already took the first dose of misoprostol and it all came back to me, the abandonment, the neglect from the day I gave birth, and after childbirth, the paternity leave I gave him was just useless, later on I figure out that he didnt disclosed that I was pregnant to his company. And yes, he left me with child care after birth with minimal help as he told me, as he ALWAYS told me that I need to be self-sufficient. And yesterday, it all crashed down on me. The same reason I had to deal with from the times I asked him for help. So I decided to handle things on my own. I went through the process scared, anxious, paranoid and alone.
- He went to work in the morning and went home around 12pm to offer help but my mind is already dysregulated and already disconnected that I refused to receive any help from him. Then he got angry and started shouting and even throwing things inside our room while im actively going through the abortion. Even threatened to hit me but shouted in front of my face instead.
- I was still firm that Im not gonna accept any help from him, the amount of stress that hes giving me is just not helping. So I was left with my 1 year old, crying, doing tantrums while my body is shaking, painfully going through the process. He didnt even bother with child care so I can focus with my process. Idk, hes trying to help but not really helping, shit made me really confused at this point, but oh well, what can I do? I just continued the process with all the emotions that Im feeling. No one to talk to, just trying to seek comfort while watching tiktok clips. 
- 3pm, I was able to finish the procedure and was crying and breaking down for couple of hours after seeing my angel. 
- The next few hours I started bleeding heavily, passing big clots after and cramping so bad that ibuprofen didnt even help to minimize the pain. Fell asleep but woke up around 3am with severe cramping, passed another big clots until dawn. 
- I woke at 3am and I thought It was already done but he even messaged my only friend whos been there for me but was not pro-abortion, telling her that she should check on me as I was doing the abortion. Now my only friend already FOd me as it was against her ethics to tolerate this. I felt betrayed for what he did and disappointed with everything that I just want to die. My grief was beyond comprehension, I just dont understand anything anymore at this point.

March 16
- Post MA today, Im still somewhat heavily bleeding 1 1/2 pads within 2 hours, but I decided to go to the mall as if nothing happened, hoping I can pass out there and die, I was just nauseous and dizzy but still able to walk and even bought groceries for me and my 1 year old baby. 
- I broke down after eating, almost had a panic attack while lining up to the cashier cause I saw a pregnant woman being held by her husband/partner

I just got home and I broke down again. I cant do this anymore, this is just too much for me. My body is trembling and I feel cold. I just dont know how to push forward from here.

2025-03-16,1742124188.0,"My sister wants to plan the baby shower, but is totally dropping the ball. She is now hurt that my mother in law has been planning the whole thing. And she is taking it out on *me*.","My sister and I don't have the best relationship to begin with, which makes this a lot harder. She has narcissistic tendencies and there was a period of time where we didn't speak for almost 6 months. But she is always very insistent on us being family and that she wants to do things for me, and has been absolutely *adamant* about planning my baby shower for me. It just always needs to be on her terms, or she likes having something to threaten me with or dangle over my head (i.e. baby shower). Like, if I upset her in any way, she says ""well I just won't throw your baby shower then."" It's a control thing. This leads to her procrastinating, not getting things done in time, dropping the ball, or just not doing things at all. It's a lifelong pattern.

That being said, I was given advice about this situation in the AITAH subreddit to have someone else help her along or watch her. Hold her accountable essentially. My mother in law is an absolute angel. She and I are very alike, meaning she has been on top of everything. She volunteered to do the whole thing and was very happy to join with my sister when I suggested it. My sister seemed happy with it too. Until my sister just didn't do anything for it.

Fast forward a little bit, at 20 weeks pregnant my MIL said she didn't hear from my sister so she booked the venue and did all the phone calls to actually find a place. My sister did not help.

At 21 weeks pregnant, MIL and I are finding addresses and making spreadsheets to make RSVPs easier. My sister didn't add a single address.

At 21+3 weeks pregnant, my MIL sent my sister and I a message updating about addresses, and she specifically mentioned my sister's name and asked her if she wanted to do the invitations. I didn't hear back from my sister in days and, unsure of she reached out to MIL directly, I texted her myself asking if she said anything. She said she didn't because she's been so busy. Her never-ending excuse for everything she doesn't feel like doing. I said fine whatever. I texted MIL to let her know (kindly) about my sister procrastinating and to let me know if she doesn't hear back.

At 22 weeks pregnant, we see MIL in person, and she is excitedly showing DH and I shower invites she created! They're beautiful and so cute, and she took so much stress off of me in that moment. But fearing my narcissistic sister, I asked if MIL ever heard back from my sister. She said she did not. Of course!! Ugh.

Fast forward to last night 22+2, I talked to my sister to let her know that MIL was planning on moving full speed ahead of she didn't hear back. My sister attempted to give me every excuse in the book, and started saying ""well why didn't she follow up with me then??"" She completely ignored the fact that she did in fact receive MIL's message, AND mine following up. I told her she needs to communicate and that's why MIL is moving forward, because it needs to be done. The shower is still 3 months away but MIL wants to order invites and have family from out of state come, so about 2 months beforehand they will go out. My sister said she was planning on ordering the invitations at the end of April when she finally would have time. I said that is over a month from now! She became very aggressive toward me and said ""Your mother in law just wanted to help and now she's doing the whole thing!""

What she doesn't know is that I've learned to hold my ground.

I told her yes, my MIL is doing the whole thing right now, because you cannot communicate with anyone, you procrastinate, and this has to be done. You can do games or themes or decorations when you ""have time"" later, but I am not doing this with you. There is a baby on the way and he will come on the due date, not when you ""have time."" The shower will be done on the date it is scheduled. Not when you ""have time.""

My husband is aware and is very supportive. I reached out to my MIL to let her know that I spoke with my sister about everything (again leaving out details of arguments and feelings). I told her if she doesn't hear back from my sister before the end of the weekend to move forward with the invitation order.

I'm done sparing feelings for my sister because she doesn't seem to prioritize mine in any way. She hasn't lifted a finger for this shower and lets things go too far before she even starts. Not to mention she is completely broke and can't afford anything. My MIL is an absolute hero and I love her. It just sucks that my sister can't get her shit together long enough to even plan a party. A very important one to shower her first nephew to be.

Thanks for listening. This has been an utter nightmare but I feel a lot better not sparing feelings for someone who doesn't give a crap about mine.

Hi everyone,  

This is my first post, and I really need some opinions and support. In my community, theres a lot of stigma around elective C-sections, and its making me feel even more anxious about my decision.  

I am 32 years old from India currently living in Australia. Im currently 37 weeks pregnant with gestational diabetes but no other complications. I have a strong fear of vaginal delivery and have been leaning towards an elective C-section. My husband was initially supportive, but after our last appointment, where the doctor discussed the risks, he became a bit hesitant and asked me to rethink it. However, he reassured me that he would support my final decision.  

I also have my mom coming to help for three months postpartum, so I know Ill have support during recovery. Despite that, I cant shake the guilt and pressure from the stigma surrounding elective C-sections.  

Id love to hear from others whove been in a similar situation. How did you handle the decision? How was your recovery? And if youve faced judgment for choosing a C-section, how did you deal with it?  

Thanks in advance for your thoughts!  ",pregnant,9.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jbfl3b/what_should_i_go_for_c_section_or_vaginal_delivery/

2025-03-13,1741899475.0,"Newly pregnant after TTC for a year, an ectopic, and diagnosed infertility","I guess I need somewhere to spill my news of excitement and anxiety. 

My husband and I decided to TTC last year this month and we got pregnant in July, only for it to end with an ectopic pregnancy rupturing and I lost my right fallopian tube. I was diagnosed with stage 3 endometriosis during this surgery (which I never knew I had) and it had eaten through my entire fallopian tube, causing the ectopic. It was covering my ovaries and all over my insides. After my ectopic, we continued TTC with times sex and using LH strips and BBT monitoring. 

After my ectopic, I started having really short luteal phases (7-8 days) several months in a row. After pushing my OBGYN, they finally decided to run CD21 progesterone labs and discovered that my progesterone was too low to confirm ovulation each month. They tested me three months in a row and confirmed I had stopped ovulating on my own. That combined with my stage 3 endo diagnosis, I was diagnosed with infertility. 

In January, they did an endometriosis excision surgery and found that my other tube was completely clear (yay!). They ran progesterone labs again the following month and I still was not ovulating. They decided to put me on Letrozole 5mg. 

I hit one year TTC this month and my husband and I took a trip to France. I didnt have my hopes high because Im so used to disappointment and seeing negatives, but the night I got home, on 10DPO, I got a positive. 

I immediately took a digital and it came back positive too. I cant believe my first cycle on 5mg Letrozole actually worked!! I am cautiously excited because the protocol following an ectopic is to get bloodwork every 48 hours until I can get a 6 week placement scan to ensure it is not ectopic again. I have started my bloodwork and my 6 week appointment is scheduled. 

I am terrified of losing this baby that we have tried for for so long. I am waiting for the other shoe to drop and I cant help but feel terrified that this baby wont make it, despite really healthy first bloodwork.

2025-03-13,1741900417.0,Partner tried to convince me not to go to the hospital.,"Hi everyone just have something on my mind that I want to share.

I am 38 1/2 weeks and this past weekend I got extremely sick to the point where I could barely move. The next day I was having some very weird, heavy,  and sometimes painful feeling in my uterus so I decided to go to the hospital to get checked out. I am a black woman and also big and more so on the obese side of the BMI scale and both of those things have statistically been known to cause problems for pregnant women.

Anyways while getting ready to go my partner said how can I convince you to wait longer to go? Meaning to not go at all and today told me she asked her step mom as well during that time how to convince me not to go. She said she didnt want me to take a trip to the hospital when I didnt need to. She thought, that I thought I was in labor, she said she didnt know that I felt like something was wrong, and knew that you werent in labor. =- Like what? 

Either way how could someone want to convince their partner not go get checked out if they feel they need to. Im in disbelief that she would even go out of her way to try and find a way to convince me not to go. Ive had multiple near death experiences throughout my life and already dont have a good track record with doctors listening to me in the first place leading to almost catastrophic consequences.

2025-03-15,1742030442.0,We both want abortion but my wife can't get over the fears from her beliefs. How can i help her?,"Hi guys,

I seriously need your help on this, and this is a long one.

We just got married, and we f'd up. We know this is our mistake and we are blaming ourselves for letting this happen.

My wife and I just found out she's pregnant a few days ago, just a month after our wedding. The scan we did yesterday didn't even show the embryo inside the uterus, so we still have time to decide what to do. It's very early. It's too early even to do a MA. Now our initial reaction and up to even now after a few days is that we are not ready to have kids. We still want to enjoy our lives and no matter how we go through the scenarios in our head and together, we can not imagine and cannot accept the reality that there will be a children in our life, at least at this time. We fully believe having a kid will more likely leave us with more suffering, and unhappiness. We've talked to great lengths about this and agree that we will be most happy and content with just each other.

But my wife is a firm believer in Buddhist teachings, and she believes that we'd be committing a major sin, akin to murder and she seems to be unable to overcome this to get the courage to make the final decision. And i don't know how to help her get through this. I believe that the decision we want to make will lead to less sufferings, and better for all parties involved. But I fear that if we decide to have an abortion, she will also not be happy and will be in tremendous mental pain and I don't know if she will even be able to heal from it.

We are also super torn due to the fact that other than our own selfish needs and the vision that we have for our life together, there's no other reason to have this abortion. We are happily in love, both our families are well off, incredibly kind, helpful to us and will be over the moon if we reveal to them about the pregnancy. There's no real financial strain to speak of to take care of the baby if we let this happen. In our culture people believe that having children is a blessing, so there's no chance of talking to anyone else in our families about this, because we will face massive judgements that will make it impossible to even speak about an abortion, so that leaves us alone to work this out.

I've tried to convince my wife that this is not a crime, and we are making this decision believing it will be best for our life together, that what ever is inside her right now is not yet a living human being, and if we make this decision with kindness in our hearts, there is no need to fear of guilt, karma or anything like that. But she is dismissing me everytime I mention it and doesnt want or unable to let go of her strong beliefs. I can see that she's in the middle of a crossroads and cannot find a way out that she can accept. She's in great pain, and I'm feeling it too.

2025-03-15,1741998336.0,C-section rescheduled day of,"Today was supposed to have been my scheduled C-section. I (32 female 39 weeks and 5 days pregnant) had everything, literally everything, I could think of done, cleaned, prepped and figured out. So of course the day prior my fiancé comes down with an illness. Mind you I've been extremely hyper vigilant on avoiding any illnesses this entire pregnancy. I wear disposable gloves and use Lysol wipes at the grocery store, avoid crowded events and stay away from people who are experiencing any symptoms. 

Yesterday morning my fiancé woke me up to tell me he was ill so I had him take a 3 panel at home test for COVID19 and flu A&amp;B. Everything came back negative. I noticed that my throat was starting to feel sore as well so I called the labor&amp;delivery department where my csection was scheduled as well as my obgyn. They both said to just come regardless and even though my fiancé is sick with fever, chills, head/body aches, congestion and runny nose he could still come too. Of course we would need to take proper precautions though. 

I continued to finish my preparations last night with the hope that this was just the RSV, that I'm vaccinated from, currently going around but still i woke up this morning with extreme anxiety. Looking at my s.o. hardly able to stand I asked him to take another test. He did and tested positive for flu A. Mind you my fiancé isn't the greatest at self awareness. He has been constantly coughing into his hands and touching everything. The pets, grabbing silverware, light switches, door knobs and cabinets. I'm trying to stay as calm as possible repeatedly disinfecting things behind him and kindly suggesting that he frequently washes his hands, coughs into his shirt and avoids touching everything. 

I felt like my fate had already been sealed and I was about to have a C-section then come down with the flu with a newborn and have no one to help with the baby and C-section recovery. My fiancé is like the typical manly man that gets taken out by illnesses. Nothing against him but I know I wouldn't be able to rely on him to safely take care of the baby while avoiding transmission. So I called labor/delivery and they said they'd have my obgyn call me. He never did so I prepared to go in anyway and once I got there they had him on the phone and he said let's just go ahead and reschedule.

I was initially at first relieved because I can't handle the thought of doing all of this alone while sick. The thought of a newborn with the flu feels like a nightmare. Now I'm reading that pregnancy with the flu can cause still births. I am just so torn because my only concern is our baby and I worry if I made the wrong choice. I'm not sure exactly what I'm asking for on here. Maybe some shared experiences and advice. I wouldn't be able to live with myself if anything happened to my baby girl. My anxiety has been dragging me all over the place. Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read and respond to this.

EDIT: Anywhere I said Advil, Im not taking advil, its off brand Acetaminophen, I got my name brand drugs mixed up,

FTM (22) here, first knowledge of the pregnancy was an at home test, and we are super excited! Id been trying to find an ob/gyn to get scheduled into, but everyone's booked out till April. Cons of being in a town with no other hospitals for 3+ hours.

For a few weeks, id been having terrible right side cramping, enough to bring me to tears in the middle of the night, and overall soreness in my abdomen. After about two weeks, my husband finally forced me to go to the ER to make sure it wasn't ectopic, my appendix, or some other thing. After an ultra sound, the tech looking confused, and two much more in depth ones, they determined I have two endometrial horns? The doc wasn't too entirely sure, but she said that I have a yolk sack w/ no fetal pole in my right horn, and ""small nonspecific fluid or hemorrhage within the left endometrial horn"", along with my right ovary being 2.6x1.9x2.6, and my left one being 4.1x2.1x3.2.

The docs seemed a little concerned, and gave my pregnancy a 50% viability, and wanted me to come back for a repeat quantitative HCG in 48-72 hours, and wanted another ultrasound in 1 week. I was also put on strict pelvic precautions, with no heavy lifting. They referred me to an OB/GYN in branch and sent me on my way.

We came back 3 days later to do the repeat test, and they didn't put in a lab, no one there knew anything about it, they said that was something for my OB to schedule. The only scheduling I can get anywhere close to the ob is with a nurse practitioner New Patient appointment in two weeks. They'll only check my vitals and get me into the system as a patient, a 15 min appointment. I wont even be able to see a doctor. The one they referred me to was on maternity leave, and the only doctor with any slots open was available for mid April, but I cant be scheduled for that at all until my new patient. I cant get in for an ultrasound unless I go back to the ER and check myself in again, or I wait till April to get myself seen by an ob and assessed.

I'm still in a lot of pain, its been about a week calling all over town and even to other towns, and no one can seem to squeeze me in. I cant really sit comfortably, and I don't know if this is normal cramping and I'm being dramatic or what, but work isn't helping me out either. The ER nurse wrote my precautions on my discharge papers, and gave me a note for work, but they ""don't take doctors notes"" and are trying to argue that pushing and pulling carts is ""not lifting because its PUSHING, duh"". I feel like I'm about to pass out on my shifts, but I don't want to go back to the ER just to be told the exact same thing.

Is first trimester usually this rough? I know the vomiting and the tiredness are normal, I can hardly keep anything down and I sleep for 20 hours a day on my days off, but I just cant shake the feeling that somethings fundamentally wrong. I'm taking Advil, but I'm afraid of taking too much, I've always been an anti drugs (for me) kinda person, and its always been ibuprofen that's worked better for me anyways. Independent practices are just as booked up, and I cant de-stress when I'm hurting this much and worried about the baby being okay. Am I doing something wrong, am I missing something? I feel like no one ever had this much issue so early on,  and complications are either obvious, or happen later and they already have a doctor support system.

Backstory: My boyfriend was 13 years younger than me, I have 2 kids from a previous marriage, this was really the first time I was in love with someone again after my divorce which was a couple years out at this point. We got pregnant after seeing each other for about 3 months. At the time, it felt like an relatively easy answer. Never totally easy, especially as a mom, I know what it's like to go through pregnancy and give birth and love my babies, but I went ahead and opted for a MA right away. It ended up being fairly traumatic though, because it didn't work. I had to go in and get an ultrasound to confirm, and then went on to get a D&amp;C as soon as I could after that. So yeah, totally sucked, definitely left a mark on me more so than I would have expected. 

Fast-forward a few months later: I was on birth control pills now, and end up getting pregnant AGAIN anyways. This time, I'm feeling the effects of the previous experience, my boyfriend and I are much more stable and in love as a couple. I'm not really too spiritual but the chances of all this happening really floored me. I felt so much more protective of this pregnancy, big mama bear energy. Like I wanted to meet this person. I even started looking into open adoptions and contemplated what it would be like to raise a baby on my own, which honestly I felt pretty confident about. My boyfriend was freaked out, and basically gave me an ultimatum saying that if I went and kept the pregnancy he doesn't know if he could stay with me romantically at that point. I felt SO in love with this person that as soon as he said that, that was it, I felt so committed to our relationship and was like, I can't blame him for feeling this way, I get he was young and freaking out, but I choose him and our relationship. Had a harder time getting over this abortion, got depressed, the holidays were really rough for me. I was having a ton of depression and anxiety during this time. Then in January, about 3 months after the abortion, he broke up with me. 

It's been a couple months later, and I'm just SO angry and hurt. I'm such a loyal partner and I'm just so confused. I also hate the fact that this is causing me pain and I think about this all the time and I'm sure he hasn't even realized or given it a second thought. I usually have a lot of compassion for people, like if he needed to leave the relationship, I get it, but the timing still feels so awful, it still feels like I made a huge sacrifice for nothing.

My OB wanted to induce because while I do not have GD or diabetes, I do have a strong family history of diabetes and gained 6 pounds in between the 3 weeks of my last appointments. OB wanted to be safe rather than sorry and scheduled me for 39 weeks, which I agreed with.

This was my second pregnancy. My first came at 38 weeks, water breaking but no contractions so I was given pitocin and other meds to help me along. My epidural never really worked the way it was supposed to and by the time my 26 hour labor (1 hour pushing) was over I could transfer myself to my own gurney. I also felt a lot of pain while pushing. 

For this baby my OB said she'd give me the epidural whenever i was ready. I opted when I was around 3-4cms. They didn't give me pitocin until the epidural was working, which was such a game changer. She did break my water before but the cervix check hurt more than that. We got the epidural placed and all was well. I started feeling my right leg though, as well as contractions on that side of my stomach, and had to tell a nurse three times before she got the anesthesiologist to come back and look at it. 

Once it was pulled back and adjusted my pain was gone. They said I could probably push if I was ready and 5 minutes later, my baby was born.

2025-03-13,1741899931.0,Severe food anxiety?? ED symptoms coming back with pregnancy,"I'm almost through my second trimester and have thankfully had a healthy pregnancy so far. I've tried to be relatively vigilant about the things I'm eating and avoid highly processed food or fast foods, and balance my diet in general so I'm not getting too much of one thing. Of course, sometimes it doesn't always work out, but I like to think I'm doing alright. The issue is, it seems like my desire to eat healthy has verged into overreactive anxiety. It's gotten really bad, where I'm starting to actually count grams of each ingredient and overthink even healthy things, like peanut butter or yogurt or too much fruit. A few years ago I battled anorexia, and it occurred to me today that a lot of the thoughts I've had the past couple weeks seem almost identical to the ones I struggled with back thenthe only difference is that I'm not starving myself. However, if I wasn't pregnant, I probably would. It doesn't help that my mom keeps sending me posts all the time about potential dangers, like chemicals in foods or mattresses or toys, etc. She's trying to be helpful but it just makes me feel worse. I had two brownies yesterday and cried about it because I felt so ashamed. Now I'm avoiding my salad because I think the lettuce tastes weird and I worry there's pesticides on it.

2025-03-15,1742042496.0,Husband keeps putting his phone on airplane mode,"Im 36 weeks pregnant and I live at home with my husband who has a difficult time sleeping. He often goes to sleep in the guest bedroom down the hall.

I dont mind typically, since I know he struggles with sleeping. However now that Im deep in the third trimester, I need him to be available. And often during the night&he isnt.

2 weeks ago, I had very bad pains for an hour that stopped me from being able to switch sides or even get out of bed. I felt like a beached whale. I tried calling him and texting him, but his phone was on do not disturb and he didnt add me as a person to get through to him when I needed to. After about 20 mins, I was able to get up and crouch my way over to the room down the hall where I angrily woke him up. Bc hes such a disturbed sleeper, he anxiously started yelling what what what! At the top of his lungs at me. I was really upset, bc I felt when I needed him around for our baby, he wasnt there. He was angry for about ten minutes that I woke him up and was grumbling about how I get to nap during the day and he doesnt, but I wasnt having any of it. Respectfully I told him to shut his mouth and do/say nothing unless its about being there for me. Im Puerto Rican and I dont play that . Turns out the baby dropped 2 centimeters!

A couple days later, Im up in the am and hes still sleeping in. My 2 40 pound dogs are on me and Im so big I cant get them off. I try calling him, since I made myself a do not disturb contact and wouldnt you know, he put on his airplane mode! So I couldnt reach him regardless. His excuse was well I went to the other room at 6 am and I figured you were up and youd be fine. Suffice it to say, I was NOT happy. I told him he cant do this, that he needs to be reachable at all times, even if Im just downstairs. 
What if I fall? What if Im in pain again and cant move? What if the dogs wont let me get up? I said if he did it again, there would be big problems.

Now today, same thing. This time, he slept in the other room all night and the dogs are crying to be walked and Im texting/calling him..his phone is off. Im trying to yell for him..but he isnt hearing me. He also planned on waking up this am to go for a quick shake out run since hes running a half marathon tmrw. His mother is landing from Minnesota in a half hour and hes not up. I made it clear that we need to turn over the guest room for her, and need to sweep downstairs. I cleaned pretty much the whole house in prep for her yesterday. Went to Costco to do my final prep run for freezer meal prep for us, so he doesnt lose his mind cooking meals and making a mess bc I wont be able to help much, AND went to his race expo with him to pick up his bib and help him navigate it. Its his first big formal race and Ive ran multiple halfs and a marathon. So wanted to show my support for him.

Why is she coming? Bc he needs to go to a work conference for a week in Utah and the only way Id let him go is if he made sure someone was with me. Bc Im always tired and always need some help.

Am I being a brat or unreasonable to want my husband to not put his need for sleep over making himself available to me in my last month of pregnancy? He is other wise a wonderful husband during the day for the most part. Helps me clean the kitchen after I cook, will do some laundry, help clean the bathroom when I ask, walk the dogs when he can etc. He can be a little selfish from time to time with his day, but who cant? 

Im just getting so annoyed that I have to keep having this convo with him and Im debating telling his mother. Although I dont know what that will do..she tends to coddle him lol. Ive done a lot of work to get him to be less coddled lol. Ive also done a lot of work to get myself to a point where I dont just pop off on him. Being a New Yorker and Latina, thats my instinct. But he doesnt respond well to that and says Im being disrespectful and wont engage with me.

Sorry for the rant everyone. Any advice? Am I being nuts? Thanks!

Update: I popped off on him via text and told him Im telling both of our parents he keeps doing this. He said sorry and that his phone gets put on airplane mode automatically and its just habit. Well it wasnt a habit when he had it on do not disturb and we got into a fight over that right? Now that I can reach him through DND, now its a years long habit lol. I just told him that the fact that he didnt make it a priority to be cognizant of before bed shows how careless and selfish hes being.  I def got tough and rude with him and he told me to stop a few times, which promptly got met with a stfu >7<ý@. Now hes up and trying to check and see if Im ok.

I'm literally crying my eyes out as I type this. I'm 39+6 today, I will be 40 weeks tomorrow. I have tried *everything* I can do get this baby out since 39 weeks. Now before I get lectured about being patient and letting the baby &amp; my body do what it needs to do, I want to say that unless you're in my situation, I don't want to hear that. 

I wanted to be induced at 40 weeks from the beginning as this as been a very difficult pregnancy and I *have* to work up until I give birth and I work as a housekeeper at a hospital, so I have a physically demanding job. I have accomodations and now I only clean one corridor during my shift but at this point, I'm so exhausted. Everything hurts. I have no stamina or energy anymore.

But at my last appointment with my OB, she didn't want to schedule an induction and wanted to discuss it later (this was at 37 weeks) I missed my 38 week appointment due to oversleeping and I missed my 39 week appointment which was yesterday due to the fact that I was having contractions and believed I was going into labor so I spent the time that should've been my appointment, at the hospital being evaluated for the contractions. The contractions stopped. So, it was false labor I guess. 

My next appointment is on the 19th but my doctor will be out of office and I'm meeting with her nurse instead. 

But I can't take this anymore. I just want relief. I'm sick of working while heavily pregnant. I just want to have my baby and start my leave. 

I'm going to try the miles circuit again tonight but if that doesn't work, I feel like my last resort is to go to L&amp;D and beg for them to induce me tomorrow at 40 weeks. I don't care about pitocin, emergency C-Sections, or anything else. I am literally losing my mind, I'm at my wit's end and I can't stop crying, I can't take this anymore 

If I didn't work or have an office job, then yes I'd be more patient, but with the nature of my job, it's just too much for me

My boyfriend (22) and I (25) always said that if an ""oops"" happened, abortion would be the planbut we also acknowledged that you never truly know how youll feel until you're in that situation. And now, here we are.

I finish my nursing degree in December, have a steady job managing social media (which isnt hard to do and pays well), and were planning to move to Florida next summer. My boyfriend still has at least 3-4 years left of school (he's studying to be a chiropractor or physical therapist), and while he wants to be a dad one day, he admits now is not ideal. That said, he has made it clear that its ultimately my choice, since its my body.

I am pro-choice, but the thought of going through an abortion puts me in such a dark place mentally that I genuinely dont think I could survive it. Its not that I feel ""ready"" to be a mombecause who ever really is?but I just cant see myself going through the process of an abortion. His mom initially said its my decision, but she supports abortion and even called me to basically push for it. My boyfriend, while not pressuring me, also knows keeping the baby isnt what he would have chosen.

I know having a baby right now would make things a lot harder, especially with our move coming up. But I also know I *can* do it. My job is remote, and Ill still be able to work once we move. Plus, Ive always dreamed of being a momliterally forever. I want to be a pediatric or NiCU nurse, and once we move, I plan to find a job in either PEDS or NICU nursing while continuing to work remotely. Having a baby while finishing school wasnt part of the plan, but its not impossible.

Whats weighing on me is knowing that this wouldnt be his choice, and that his mom has already made it clear where she stands. He also told me that if we keep the baby, he probably wouldnt be able to work while studying, and he wants to be able to give the baby everything. I dont want to ruin his future, but I also feel like Id be ruining myself if I went through with an abortion.

Our relationship is so full of love, and the idea of ending this pregnancy when we are happy together *hurts*. It haunts me. I just dont know what to do.

2025-03-15,1742047519.0,"Baby #2 after 3 consecutive losses, cautiously optimistic.","TW: talk of losses.

Hello lovelies. I found out I was pregnant at 3+5 weeks, I'm currently 4+2. So I'm super early. My first pregnancy I had a healthy daughter, the next 3 were all early losses. One natural and 2 MMC. When I did get my BFP this time I got a faint line and a couple days after I still got another faintish line. I'm slightly concerned about the faint lines I got. 

My symptoms are currently strong, intermittent severe nausea, really tender breasts and engorgement, bloating, and headaches. Is there anyway that I'll currently be having a chemical with all of my symptoms? I'm having very slight and intermittent light brown discharge but it is only very slight and definitely only happens a couple times a day when I wipe. Not heavy or filling up a panty liner at all.

2025-03-14,1741917960.0,How do you cope with frustration/ arguments/ high emotional situations?,"9weeks 2days

Its been so frustrating for me to navigate high stress emotions during pregnancy. I've always been a sensitive and emotional person, but I had a good system of taking space, smoking a hot of weed and letting it chill my mind so I could process and work through my emotions. just having the control to be able to change how I was feeling in an instant was so helpful in breaking my emotional spiraling and allowing myself to regulate. now I feel frustrated because I don't know how to cope. I try breathing, I try walking, I even try screaming into a pillow, but nothing helps to reduce the feelings and I feel so helpless now. I also get frustrated because there are so many things I've had to give up while my partner doesn't have to and I can't help but feel childish and resentful that I have to give everything up and feel nauseous and exhausted and extra emotional and then I get frustrated with myself for feeling like that because that's not who I want to be. I feel so trapped and limited and I know it's temporary, but it's so so hard on those moments. 

so I'm wondering, if anyone else feels like this, how do they navigate it? I have worked so hard to be a good communicator and to be present and to work through my emotions, but they've just really been getting the best of me and I don't know how I'm going to get through this.

2025-03-15,1742041015.0,"Just had a surgical abortion, now Im grieving and scared","I live in America, TN. I was 24 weeks but traveled out of state for an abortion.

I genuinely wish I couldve kept the baby, but Im not married just yet, still with the father who helped me through everything.

Its been really hard for me because I didnt want to tell anyone I was pregnant but people at my work found out and it stressed me out because I couldnt let my family find out and I dont want the news getting back to them. Im a strong baptist but Ive always had more relaxed views of abortion because I understood the need for them to be here.

I went to an incredible clinic out of state that took care of my mental needs while handeling the abortion with such great professionalism and humanity. But its killing me not feeling my baby moving inside me anymore, not being able to hold her.

I didnt even think I could be pregnant. I used to be forced into prostitution and had an eating disorder and other medical conditions that doctors told me it would be impossible for me to get pregnant.

When I finally told the father he was so strong and supportive, helping me through everything. But the weight of everything leaves us numb. I hold my babys prints and blanket and just cry. How long does this pain last?! I know I dont deserve sympathy but it kills me.

My question is because people at work know and have been texting me asking if Im ok, and Ive been ignoring getting back with them because I dont want people knowing about it. But I know when I come back to work people are going to ask and its going to kill me.

What do I say?? Especially in the area I live, abortion especially at the time I had it are extremely frowned upon. And I dont want work to become hostile but they will all know when they see me Im no longer pregnant.

Whats a good line to explain even to my boss? That I miscarried?? What could cause such a late miscarriage? Could I get some advice please.",abortion,14.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jbttos/just_had_a_surgical_abortion_now_im_grieving_and/
2025-03-14,1741911316.0,"Today I had the most inappropriate, violating, dismissive, condescending care ever by an MFM who has never met me before."," WARNING  If you are near Long Island, NY and you ever have a pregnancy in which you need a referral to an MFM for possible high-risk factors, DO NOT EVER go to Cecilia Avila, part of Stony Brook Medicine. Every other doctor in this practice is wonderful. I got the bad egg this time due to bad timing and luck. 

Today I received the most inappropriate and VIOLATING care Ive ever received by a doctor (keep in mind this includes the team and surgeons that *misdiagnosed my appendicitis and left my appendix in by accident*, rendering me infertile and needing IVF in the first place. I wish I had looked up her reviews beforehand. Theyre dreadful. 

Today I was supposed to see an MFM one more time as a formality to make sure I can continue under the Midwives care for the remaining 1-4 weeks of my pregnancy and deliver with them. Thats not what happened. 

Would rate negative stars if I could. She came into the room without ever greeting me or introducing herself. Without ever having met me or reviewing my chart, told me she refuses to allow me back into the SBU midwives care although I have *no high-risk factors* at 36 weeks other than my age (45) and this being an IVF pregnancy. (The baby is in perfect health and is growing on schedule. I am in perfect health, BP is fine, no GD.)

She then told me my plan to go to 40 weeks is basically killing my baby, although Id already been cleared by another MFM in the practice to do exactly that with close monitoring. The statistics for placental issues after 39 weeks for IVF/older patients are in 17/1000 births as opposed to 11/1000 births in other pregnancies. Thats still only 1.7% vs 1.1% - yes, its 42% higher than younger natural pregnancies but LOOK AT THE NUMBERS. 

She went on a rant, speaking poorly of all of these IVF patients lately who dont want induction or to go before 40 weeks and want care other than MFM. Her opinion on IVF patients desire for the least invasive options that can *safely* be done was vile and simply& wrong. Im not a monster for wanting to be under the care of midwives that are still connected to the hospital system, particularly when an OB or MFM on call at the hospital can take over at any time if medically necessary. 

The icing on the cake was when she did a RECTAL SWAB INSERTION for Group B Strep with no forewarning of what she was about to do. I understand this can be part of the process, but a decent doctor would tell the patient what she was about to do first. Had I done this at my midwife appointment, the swab wouldve been self-administered and ONLY vaginal. Not even a hello, and she was shoving a Q-tip up my ass. 

Ive never been treated like this by any medical professional  in 45 years of life. She was dismissive, haughty, condescending, rude, and violating. She does not belong seeing patients. She should be a desk doctor only, reviewing paperwork or in a lab somewhere. Her knowledge of IVF pregnancies is outdated and shes not up on the current peer-reviewed science. She bases opinions on old information and is not interested in hearing new statistics. Checking her reviews, she has told patients to TMFR without doing any actual diagnostic testing!

An MFM sees patients who are high-risk and already frightened and anxious about their pregnancies and their babies health. To treat these patients with anything other than kind, gentle, compassionate care is negligent at best, and dangerous and detrimental to both mental and physical health.

Im not a Karen. I have never reported a doctor in all of the years Ive been alive. Ive seen MANY doctors. This is the first time I have ever been treated like this. I am filing a formal complaint with Patient Advocacy as well as the home office. I plan to contact the Board as well. It seems Im not the first patient who has had this experience - but I want to make sure I am the last. No one should ever be told theyre killing their baby or have an invasive test without warning. 

I honestly have no idea who will be handling my pregnancy here on out, and its so jarring. I was almost at the finish line.

I plan on talking to my doctor tomorrow but I am struggling with my anxiety. 

I am currently 20w along with my second pregnancy. 

I first was great till the birth. Had him at 39+4 and he was semi big at 8lb 1oz. He also was sunny side up (nose facing my pelvis vs nose facing tail bone like normal) And for anyone that doesn't know that means that the widest part of the baby head is coming out first instead of the cone part of the head which is made to come out first. 

Him being born in that position caused me to tear in 3 locations all needing stitches and all VERY painful. I had the Epidural for my labor which also was a very long process for me as well but it only semi worked. i could feel contraction pain in my tail bone and my left butt cheek... they of course turned it off for the pushing part which lasted 2 1/2 hours for me. 

During my birth i was crying and saying i couldn't handle it anymore, i was in so much pain i wanted to quit. which i technically did as i stopped pushing myself though my body still naturally pushed and they had to help pull him out of me once his head came out. 

I feel as though I'm sort of traumatized and I'm having so much anxiety about giving birth again. I've told my husband that I am considering a C section as the cons of a c section sound way more worth it to me than going through a 24 hour labor, and 2+ plus hours of pushing and feeling like I'm giving up. 

I am aware a C section has a several month healing process, I'm aware of how the procedure works. What I maybe want is hearing other peoples experience. Did you choose to do a C section after a birth that scared you? what did you do to help with the anxiety of going through that pain again?

I got lucky and my annual exam ended up being my first appointment at 5w. All was looking good. Then I had some spotting so of course I worried. No cramps, no flow so I tried to remain calm. 

My next appt was at 8w and I was convinced Id get bad news, all was good, strong heartbeat and we got to see the little bean>. Then I had more frequent spotting sometimes bleeding so more freaking out. It seemed like the longest two weeks waiting for my next appointment.

Next up, 10w and NIPT. Baby was looking good, strong heartbeat. Then came waiting for the results so more worry. Results came in 2 days ago: low risk baby girl=. I felt brief excitement for 2 days and then last night, more spotting/bleeding and some light cramping. So Im back to worrying.

My next appt is 3/17 for NT screening and I am emotionally exhausted. Part of my worry is my doctor hasnt found a reason for the bleeding.

She couldnt see anything on the first one so she said she would have to do a transvaginal ultrasound. Then nothing she said she saw nothing in my uterus or tubes. No egg sac no anything. I was heartbroken. She told me it could be a few things she said she could have either missed it and that she has missed three peoples babies and another clinic was able to pick them up. This clinic is within my insurance so I know people will say just go to another clinic but I dont have the means at the moment. Or she said it could still be an ectopic pregnancy and she would check hcg hormones and that I might need to go to the er today. It was all really really frighting and I was excited to see my baby today and now she has told me there is nothing on the scan.  Luckily I did not have to go to the er.

2025-03-15,1742070086.0,"Do Women Have a Moral Duty to Keep Their Bodies ""Ready"" for Reproduction at All Times?","Late last year, Dr. Rebecca Gomperts (Aid Access, Women on Waves) announced results of a large clinical trial in Moldova, testing the use of a weekly low dose of mifepristone (50 mg) as a contraceptive. The results were promising, with only one pregnancy occurring within 2000 cycles. Furthermore, negative side effects were minimal, with only 4% of the participants experiencing any negative side effects (compared to a 40% negative side effect rate for conventional hormonal contraceptives). Additionally, the low-dose mifepristone was easier to use, requiring only one dose a week, and being more ""forgiving"" of variations in the time the pill is taken. And 89% of the study participants reported that they stopped menstruating while taking mifepristone as a contraceptive. (Probably most women would consider this a positive side effect.)

Because of the positive results, the trials have been expanded to the Netherlands this year. If the results continue to be positive, the plan is to apply to the European Medicines Agency for registration and market authorization to allow this weekly, low-dose mifepristone regimen as a contraceptive throughout the EU.

The method of action for mifepristone as birth control is two-fold: it reduces the rate of ovulation and it thins the endometrial lining of the uterus, making it impossible for a fertilized egg to implant.

([Source](https://msmagazine.com/2025/01/07/mifepristone-weekly-contraceptive-clinical-trials-abortion-pill-birth-control/).)

My primary question for PL supporters is this: 

* Would you have any moral or legal objections to women's use of such a contraceptive? If so, on what grounds?

Here are some secondary questions if you believe that the use of this contraceptive would be immoral:

* If a woman was taking mifepristone as described here *as a contraceptive* and informed her partner that she was doing this before they had sex, and if her partner, knowing this, decided to go ahead and have PIV sex with her, and if one of his sperm fertilized an egg but it failed to implant, whose would be the primary responsibility for the ""death"" of the fertilized egg? (Realistically, neither of them would ever know if this happened, so this is a hypothetical question.)
* *Men's* use of tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, red meat, and food high in trans fats during the months before their partners' conception is associated with higher miscarriage rates, because of these substances' impacts on sperm. ([Source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/a-mans-unhealthy-lifestyle-too-can-lead-to-his-partners-pregnancy-loss/articleshow/64072130.cms?from=mdr).)  If men engage in such unhealthy lifestyles, they are not maintaining their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction, and their choices could result in the ""death"" of a fertilized egg or even an embryo or fetus. Do they have a moral duty to maintain their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction by refraining from such lifestyle choices?",Abortiondebate,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jc47ep/do_women_have_a_moral_duty_to_keep_their_bodies/

One of them is obviously the media I consume. ""Custody of the eyes"" is easy and obvious when talking about content that is incredibly explicit or gratuitous in nature. It's best not to view it is a pretty easy conclusion to come to.

I find that when dealing with pure fantasy(Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Dragon Ball) of ""elseworlds"" so to speak...that entirely different world with an entirely different set of rules often ""Works"" for my rationalizing mind. A story about Samurai hunting monstrous demons hundreds of years ago, that clicks. Fantasy.

But surprisingly, I'm finding the sci-fi genre to have an inherently atheistic/Non-Christian view about most things. It is always so much about discovering alien life, or alien life being a given reality, presented in ways that feel like they sort of fly in the face of the Christian worldview and our understanding of Biblical history.

Meaning in the sense that they are often very pro Evolution, anti-God/Faith in lieu of putting ""science"" first, and even sometimes want to be filled with ""alternative explanations"" for the origins of life, creation, or deal with God-like beings that supplant the notion of ""God"" in our world and timeline.

I understand all movies are fictional ""what if"" scenarios...but I'm beginning to have annoyed moments when it comes to how some of these things get portrayed or addressed.

I'm not one to be overly prickly when it comes to things like this, but sometimes it just doesn't sit well with me in the genre of heavy sci-fi films, mentally reconciling what's being portrayed, stated, and implied on screen with the Biblical timeline or other Biblical truths of our world.

It ends up pushing my interest either completely into fantasy fiction like the aforementioned Dragon Ball or LOTR...or it makes me have a preference for more plausible, ""real world"" set action films like Mission Impossible and others like it.

2025-03-14,1741941564.0,Abortion Is Okay Because Its Their Choice,"At the end of the day, abortion is a personal decision, and no one should be forced to stay pregnant against their will. Pregnancy is a major medical event that affects a persons body, health, future, and life in ways that only they can fully understand. No one else has to experience the physical pain, the risks, the emotional toll, or the lifelong consequences of giving birthso why should anyone else get to decide?

Some argue that a fetus has a right to life, but even if we grant that, no one has the right to use another persons body without consent. We dont force people to donate organs, even if it would save a life. If bodily autonomy applies to everyone else, why should it suddenly stop applying to pregnant people?

People get abortions for all kinds of reasonsfinancial instability, medical risks, being too young, not wanting to be a parent, or simply not wanting to be pregnant. And they shouldnt have to justify it. No one is obligated to give up their body for someone else, and pregnancy should be no exception.

Backstory: My boyfriend was 13 years younger than me, I have 2 kids from a previous marriage, this was really the first time I was in love with someone again after my divorce which was a couple years out at this point. We got pregnant after seeing each other for about 3 months. At the time, it felt like an relatively easy answer. Never totally easy, especially as a mom, I know what it's like to go through pregnancy and give birth and love my babies, but I went ahead and opted for a MA right away. It ended up being fairly traumatic though, because it didn't work. I had to go in and get an ultrasound to confirm, and then went on to get a D&amp;C as soon as I could after that. So yeah, totally sucked, definitely left a mark on me more so than I would have expected. 

Fast-forward a few months later: I was on birth control pills now, and end up getting pregnant AGAIN anyways. This time, I'm feeling the effects of the previous experience, my boyfriend and I are much more stable and in love as a couple. I'm not really too spiritual but the chances of all this happening really floored me. I felt so much more protective of this pregnancy, big mama bear energy. Like I wanted to meet this person. I even started looking into open adoptions and contemplated what it would be like to raise a baby on my own, which honestly I felt pretty confident about. My boyfriend was freaked out, and basically gave me an ultimatum saying that if I went and kept the pregnancy he doesn't know if he could stay with me romantically at that point. I felt SO in love with this person that as soon as he said that, that was it, I felt so committed to our relationship and was like, I can't blame him for feeling this way, I get he was young and freaking out, but I choose him and our relationship. Had a harder time getting over this abortion, got depressed, the holidays were really rough for me. I was having a ton of depression and anxiety during this time. Then in January, about 3 months after the abortion, he broke up with me. 

It's been a couple months later, and I'm just SO angry and hurt. I'm such a loyal partner and I'm just so confused. I also hate the fact that this is causing me pain and I think about this all the time and I'm sure he hasn't even realized or given it a second thought. I usually have a lot of compassion for people, like if he needed to leave the relationship, I get it, but the timing still feels so awful, it still feels like I made a huge sacrifice for nothing. I feel like I want some kind of justice, but I know the healthy thing is to forgive him and move on.

Long story short my husband is a truck driver and was going back on the road and I had to send him off with a goodbye gift and I didn't think I could get pregnant so soon but I was feeling off and took a test. Before I had my last baby I had 4 miscarriages and of course my last baby is a blessing but I'm really stuck and confused as to what I should do.

2025-03-14,1741955035.0,Nervous to find out sex of baby tomorrow!,"Hi all, Im posting here because I dont have anyone else to talk to about this! 

For my first 2 children we found out the sex of our babies at birth, so I think I was just too focussed on actual labour and birth to be thinking about the sex! We decided to find out this time now but my husband loves making the calls when theyre born to tell everyone so were keeping it a secret just the 2 of us which is really exciting, also why I cant speak to anyone about it! 

We have 2 perfect boys, for my first I didnt really care for my second I so wanted another boy, I have a sister so I wanted the same sex bond I grew up with and I was so happy for my son that we had a boy. We always knew wed have a third. This time I dont really know how I feel, I love having boys and I know Ill adore having another one, my youngest wants a boy. It occurred to me this week that this is our last ever baby, so if it is another boy I will never experience having a daughter and everything that comes with that, my eldest really wants a girl. 

Id never thought about it too deeply before but it hit me a bit today that one way or another that tomorrow we will know for sure what our family will be and thats a bit overwhelming. Having never found out in pregnancy before I didnt realise how utterly nerve wrecking it is! I cant think about anything else, please tell me Im not the only one! I dont even have a real gut instinct, I think it will be a boy because I think thats all my husband makes but at every scan so far we come away thinking maybe its a girl.

2025-03-14,1741922778.0,4 Days (10 Hours) vs. 5 Days (8 Hours) While Pregnant,"Hi everyone,

Im currently 9 weeks and 4 days pregnant with my first baby. After my first prenatal appointment, I received unexpected news from my employer that we need to return to the office after nearly three years of working remotely. I was devastated because I had hoped to work from home during my pregnancy and through my babys first year, but here we are.

I spoke with my doctor about it, and she gave me some great advice to make the transition easier, like treating myself to lunch nearby, listening to my favorite podcast on the commute, and finding small ways to make the experience more pleasant. That helped me mentally prepare, but Im still struggling with first-trimester fatigue, sleepiness, food aversions, and all the fun symptoms that come with early pregnancy. I have been told things get better in the second trimester, so Im hopeful.

Now, I have the option to work either:

* 5 days a week, 8 hours a day
* 4 days a week, 10 hours a day with 3-day weekends

I would love to hear from others who have worked a flex schedule while pregnant. For context, I'm a software developer. My commute would be 45 - 60 minutes. Would working four longer days be worth it for the extra day off, or would the longer shifts be too exhausting? I understand that everyone is different and experiences may vary. I'd still love to learn about others' experiences or any advice especially if you've been in this exact situation.

I'm almost 31 weeks pregnant so the bump is bumping and I found it pretty easy to be confident when I had a hoodie or winter coat on, but now the temperatures are rising to t-shirt levels and I feel so insecure about going outside... Like I'm too exposed...

I know I have a normal pregnant body and I'm happy about my baby but I can't stop stressing about what people will say or think of me. I waited so long for spring to come thinking it would be the end of my struggles but now I'm insecure. 

I know at least 1 person here felt that way at some point so what did you do to feel more confident? Do people often comment on your bump? Do you get stares and such? Are people nicer to you when you're pregnant? Should I just stop caring and enjoy the rest of my pregnancy?
