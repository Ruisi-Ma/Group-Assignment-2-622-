I see why abortions are winning in conservative states. Its not about Liberals or Conservatives Democrats or Republicans. Most people on both parties dont wanna force their child to give birth. Its sadistic...Who would want to do that? It makes me angry seeing a 10 year old in my state get raped then she gets an abortion and the sadistic pro lifers have no sympathy for her. They just scream BABY KILLER! They dont care about what that child went through. They only care about you when your not born yet



. I listened to a song that is soooo good. Its called Kids only matter when their not born yet. SO TRUE! I decided to rant this because a friend of mine found out I am for abortions. HE TURNED ON ME! Wants nothing to do with me anymore. I tried explaining how I dont think its right to force children to give birth he just says ABORTIONS = MURDER And then blocked me. You know I see why this sadistic pro life movement cant change our minds. You cant change minds by going up to us and screaming YOUR A MURDEROR!



 That just pushes us away. With all this said I just wanted to let you all know that abortions are winning on the ballots and its a 100% good thing too. And I am not a liberal but until the republicans get their act togeather on abortions. I am gonna from now on vote for democrat to protect abortions. And one day people will eventually do this.

2025-03-15,1742009542.0,#Saytheirnames: 18-year-old Alexis Lexi Arguello (USA 2025),"18-year-old Alexis Lexi Arguello had just moved into her own apartment and was preparing to start her adult life when Planned Parenthoods negligence killed her.

Shortly after moving out, Lexi suffered a urinary tract infection, went to get medical treatment and found out that she was pregnant. Likely not sure what her next steps should be, Lexi ended up the Fort Collins Planned Parenthood facility. She was told that she was 20 weeks pregnant. Although the facilitys website claimed that they only did abortions before 20 weeks, they scheduled Lexi for one anyway. 

During the abortion, Lexi suffered life-threatening side effects. It was obvious that she needed emergency medical treatment (which Planned Parenthood did not provide and was in no way equipped for), but the staff delayed in calling an ambulance and let her deteriorate. When they finally did call the ambulance, they tried to conceal the damage done by requesting that the ambulance not use sirens. 

This was not unusual for the facility. Witness reports from protesters and numerous dispatch records documented that the facility's frequent emergencies were  mishandled in a similar way. Life-threatening medical complications were downplayed, and time and time again Planned Parenthood tried to hide what they did to their clients. Ambulances were requested to come without sirens and were frequently directed by staff to use convoluted and indirect routes to make it less obvious that they had yet another emergency. They even had paramedics approach the back instead of using the more accessible main entrance. The ""silent siren treatment"" left Lexi suffering without help for even longer, delaying care and decreasing her chances at survival.

On February 6, the day of the abortion, Lexi's grandparents were told that she was in the emergency room. Her family hadn't even known she was pregnant, and now they arrived to find her in the hospital with doctors desperately struggling to keep her alive. She had lost so much blood that a transfusion of seven liters still didn't improve her condition, and the multiple doses of epinephrine were not enough to keep her heart beating. Her oxygen was too low and despite the best attempts of the ER, her grandparents had *seen in [Lexi's] face that it was her end.* Her blood pressure and heart rate dropped again, and she died the same day as her baby.

Lexi's devastated family wanted to find some semblance of justice for her and will take her killers to court with the help of Pro-Life organization Operation Rescue. A report of what happened to Lexi was also given to the  Colorado Committee of Health and Human Services at a hearing.

The hearing was about a bill that would require abortion facilities in Colorado to follow health and safety regulations in a similar way to medical clinics. Expert witness Dr. Keri Kasun gave testimony on what an unrestricted and unregulated Planned Parenthood had done. She confirmed that Planned Parenthood had delayed Lexis emergency treatment and stated that Lexi had been showing obvious symptoms of an amniotic fluid embolism. The risk of this complication is elevated for abortions later in pregnancy, and Lexi was even further along than she had been told at 22 weeks pregnant. (A premature baby born at this age could survive when given care.)

Amniotic fluid in the bloodstream would impair clotting abilities, making any injuries inflicted on Lexi much more dangerous. The further delays by not treating this as the emergency it was made everything worse.

In response to the bill and to the investigation of their egregious actions, the Public Affairs Manager for Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains (which oversees the oversees Fort Collins chain location) argued that they shouldnt be supervised or regulated and called the corporation a beacon of hope that would ""always fight for their patients"". But as Troy Newman from Operation Rescue put it, **This Planned Parenthood did not care if Lexi Arguello survived her complications. If they had, staff would have called an ambulance the minute she exhibited symptoms, and they would have requested lights, sirens, and any other measures that might have saved Lexis life.**

2025-03-15,1742065517.0,"Apparently the possibility that a child would grow up (then die) a non-Christian, then spend eternity in Hell justifies murdering them before birth","Heres the argument: 


I assume most Christians here hold the view that God does not judge a non believing fetus the same as a fully grown non believing adult. No matter what for the fetus, he will send the fetus to heaven for eternity with him because the fetus doesn't have the capacity to have a belief in anything. So by this logic, abortion guarantees the soul of the fetus to spend eternity in the kingdom of heaven with God.... If you let the fetus grow up to be a human, statistically they have a large chance of Rejecting God and spending eternity in Hell.... Is it worth it to gamble on this? If you abort the fetus you ensure that soul is sent to heaven. It's the moral thing to do. Some of you might say ""thou shall not kill"", well even if it is, isn't this the ultimate sacrifice for ensuring eternal bliss of another soul in heaven? By this logic abortion is the absolute most moral thing you can do under the sun according to Christianity.

2025-03-15,1742041015.0,"Just had a surgical abortion, now Im grieving and scared","I live in America, TN. I was 24 weeks but traveled out of state for an abortion.

I genuinely wish I couldve kept the baby, but Im not married just yet, still with the father who helped me through everything.

Its been really hard for me because I didnt want to tell anyone I was pregnant but people at my work found out and it stressed me out because I couldnt let my family find out and I dont want the news getting back to them. Im a strong baptist but Ive always had more relaxed views of abortion because I understood the need for them to be here.

I went to an incredible clinic out of state that took care of my mental needs while handeling the abortion with such great professionalism and humanity. But its killing me not feeling my baby moving inside me anymore, not being able to hold her.

I didnt even think I could be pregnant. I used to be forced into prostitution and had an eating disorder and other medical conditions that doctors told me it would be impossible for me to get pregnant.

When I finally told the father he was so strong and supportive, helping me through everything. But the weight of everything leaves us numb. I hold my babys prints and blanket and just cry. How long does this pain last?! I know I dont deserve sympathy but it kills me.

My question is because people at work know and have been texting me asking if Im ok, and Ive been ignoring getting back with them because I dont want people knowing about it. But I know when I come back to work people are going to ask and its going to kill me.

What do I say?? Especially in the area I live, abortion especially at the time I had it are extremely frowned upon. And I dont want work to become hostile but they will all know when they see me Im no longer pregnant.

2025-03-15,1742021468.0,is it weird that i am traumatised,"hey, me again. i posted before about the abortion when i first had it. its been over a year since i had the abortion and i was recently reminded about it because i accidentally saw the notifications that my boyfriend had told one of his female friends about my abortion and she judged me for not doing well for my exams a month after i had my abortion. i feel like as a woman, shouldnt u at least try to understand how i felt? i also feel that if u arent the one lying on the chair legs up and open on display and secured to the stirrups then u shouldnt judge me for being emotionally nerfed for my exams.

i think its quite safe to say that i am maybe still a bit traumatised from the experience. context: i had a surgical abortion at 3 months. i really wanted to keep the baby but was told not to. 

i know there are people out there dying from bombs everyday and im here, one year later, still thinking about the day i lost everything. 

not sure if ill ever get over this. i feel that if i do, ill be moving on from the one thing i loved most. but at the same time it crushes me every single time i think about it. i still look at my ultrasound scans. i carry them with me everyday because i cant bear to put them away. i hope things will be better.

2025-03-15,1742040148.0,I'm just on my 2nd dose of miso and the cramps have subsided already. But I'm not sure if it's successful.,"Hey, everyone.

I took my miso today at 2PM. After about an hour, the bleeding and cramps began. I passed several clots, and the cramps was also too painful. But, I am not sure if I already passed the fetus.

I am not 100% sure of how far along I am. My last period was last December 19. I took a PT by the end of January and it was negative. But, I experienced the symptoms and spotting around the 2nd week of February. I am aware that it is possible that the PT wasn't able to detect it yet in January because it's still early. And I only took 1 test that time.

So, if you count it based on my last menstruation, it would be around 11 weeks already. But, if I became pregnant in February, it's been only a few weeks. Therefore, it is possible that I won't recognize the fetus, right? =-

The cramps is not painful anymore, and I noticed that my breasts are not sore too. I will take my 3rd dose at 8:30PM. ",abortion,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jbtl8s/im_just_on_my_2nd_dose_of_miso_and_the_cramps/

2025-03-15,1742024357.0,My person is being distant after the abortion,"hi everyone, Im 23 (f) and hes a 27 (m). In the last post I expressed how I had an abortion with the person I was seeing. I am fully recovered physically but mentally and emotionally disoriented. My person was somewhat supportive throughout the process but not exactly how I wanted him to be. He was going out a lot and speaking with other females. Me and him arent fully in a relationship but I wouldve appreciated him investing his time into me during these times. Recently he has been doing things that have been getting on my nerves. He would always plan to see me but cancel on the very last minute. He did this a good 3 times. He would reach out to me and call me to hang out but once I get ready he would flake. I feel like he was doing it on purpose and I called him out on his behaviour and decided to delete him and move on because I dont deal with men like that. He would constantly message/call apologising and would make more plans. I would forgive him naturally because of the soft spot I had for him during the pregnancy. If it wasnt for that, I wouldve disappeared. Just recently Ive seen him partying through other peoples instagram/snapchat stories and I thought it would be funny blowing up his phone. He took this to heart and told me can you stop being so clingy, I came out of a 5 year relationship she was clingy and I dont like it. I fuck with you but stop. He called me clingy in the past to but I never too it as offensive. This hurt my feelings because he said it out of anger.  I was just doing it to be annoying and he took it for a complete different meaning. It wasnt the best idea. I think he thinks I want a relationship with him because of natural loving nature. I am affection and loving to people and love to give. My plan during our time together wasnt to fall in love. However, with the excessive love bombing, he would say things like im falling in love, or when you become my mrs he would talk about marriage a lot in the beginning. Kinda scared me because I know what he was trying to do. I wanted to keep things causal but since I got pregnant I grew an attachment with him as any woman wouldve. He makes me feel bad for it and when I try to express my emotions he shuts down. Theres been loads of times he has annoyed me but I forgave him and moved on. In this case, I deleted him from social media out of hurt and few days later I tried to message on iMessage and hes giving me the silent treatment. Bear in mind we were together a week before the argument, having sex. He hasnt blocked me from iMessage but when I try to request him he ignores the request. When I did this in the past he said you can stay there and learn your lesson. When I was pregnant with him. Im not sure exactly what to do now, I want to leave one last message before I fully move on as I feel like one day sooner or later. Hes going to try to reconnect and Im going to feel emotionally disoriented again. I want to take this time to heal and fully move on without being disturbed. 



This is the message I want to leave 

I have to say I find your actions really selfish. There have been so many times when youve annoyed me, and Ive brushed it off and forgiven you. I did something to annoy you once, it wasnt the best idea, but I did it. I apologised, and Im ready to move on from it. But youre still taking it personally and saying things unprovoked. I never once said I wanted anything serious with you apologies if I gave you the wrong impression, but Im just a loving person, whether Im close to someone or not. Whats really hard to understand is that youre getting angry because I felt attached. Any woman in my position would have felt that way. And to make me feel bad about it, especially after everything Ive been through physically, emotionally, and mentally, feels inconsiderate. I dont understand why this is such a sensitive topic for you when Ive gone through it. This isnt me trying to argue with you but choosing to communicate better. You can continue with the silent treatment if you want, but just know that you wont hear from me again. 

Let me know if its a good idea or just to move on in silent. Any advice would help. ",abortion,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jbpynl/my_person_is_being_distant_after_the_abortion/

I found out I was pregnant beginning of this year and had my abortion a week after finding out. I felt so de attached and empty for the first week then went through a few week where I was so depressed, lost, regretful. Looking back I should have asked for help or spoken about my feeling more with my close ones. 

 Anyways, I thankfully managed to get back to normal weeks after and I kind of stopped thinking about my abortion and baby. Fast forward to now, for the past few days all I think about is my very short pregnancy, my baby and I now again feel a need to have a baby. I really thought I have recovered and moved on but maybe I havent? All I see now is babies and pregnant women. I cant stop thinking and day dreaming about pregnancy and being a mother. 

Has anyone got any advice? To clarify dates I had my abortion in January and my depressive stage lasted about 3 weeks. I was really hoping to be completely okay with it months after. I think I am scared that I could potentially go back to being in such a dark place. I look back and its super scary how unaware I was of how sad I truly was.

I had my ma on Monday, all was fine except I wasnt really bleeding into the pads, but everytime I went and sat on the toilet it came gushing out. Ive had mas before but always bled into the pads so this was a bit strange for me.
Tuesday-Wednesday I was fatigued, mild cramping and mild bleeding which was all to be expected.
Yesterday I felt pretty nauseous, cramping a bit more afternoon onwards and bleeding got a lot heavier in the evening time (7pm onwards).
Realised I had completely blanked taking my antibiotics on Tuesday so started the course last night.
Today I feel like Ive been run over by a truck. I feel so nauseous and sick, cramping above the waistline to the left side. Heavy bleeding has carried on but not enough to soak pads quickly. The blood has the usual after ma smell to it (coppery and slightly old smelling blood but nothing horrific). Im getting dizzy if Im standing up too quick, feeling hot (no temp), and just feel generally awful.
I know bleeding can get heavier on the 4th day, but Im just worried that forgetting the antibiotics for the 2.5 days has done some damage.

2025-03-14,1741986159.0,Strange question at Planned Parenthood abortion appointment - Why?,"I took my girlfriend to her appointment and paid for the service for her and was there throughout as she has never done this before and I havent either. At the beginning of the appointment she said she was questioned about support systems, income, family, STD history, etc. and added that they asked her if she had been with more than one person in the last 12 months. She said they dont ask for a number or anything further about it, just if youve been with more than one person. Why would that be included in the questions prior to getting an abortion and what purpose does it serve? Id assume they would ask about your last 1-3 months of sexual activity but why not that and instead asking about 12 months back?

2025-03-15,1742052802.0,Im terrified. I need help finding funding if possible. USA/PA/MD border kinda.,"Ive been searching for answers for weeks and weeks and the farther along I get, the more terrified I get. I have no friends. I have no family that cares about me. And I just feel like no matter where or who I turn to Im going to get judgement. About everything. I dont have my children at this time (I just got out of rehab and a recovery house a few months ago so still working on getting them back in my full care,) and that makes me feel even worse about getting pregnant. My boyfriend and I took a break, we were fighting A LOT, it was an almost three month break (up), and I stupidly got pregnant because the condom got stuck inside of me. Ive been trying to find funding for an abortion for weeks. I even went to a clinic that said they offered support which I misunderstood completely and I told them I didnt want to see anything. They end up doing an ultrasound, they had the audio on so I heard the heartbeat, and then they printed a photo for me to keep. They then at the end of the appointment told me they dont have the resources to help with abortion. Only prenatal, postpartum and adoption services. And then they kept me there for 30 mins telling me why I should follow through. So for two weeks it ate at me and ate at me.. but, I dont want to follow through. I want to get my own babies back first. They deserve so much better than what Ive given them in their lives. I called the national abortion fund and they told me as a head of household for one which Id technically be with me as a server making $2.33/hr and then $450/week I could not qualify for assistance. I dont see any of my hourly wages it gets garnished directly to child support for my children. So the $450 (if I make that) I have to pay the rest of my CS and get to and from work (i uber mostly as I dont have my own vehicle) I dont know where else to look. I dont want to do a Medication Abortion all alone especially not at 10 weeks+. I feel as if it will be traumatizing and it will make my mental health even worse than it already is and I do not want to relapse either because pain is a big trigger for me, so I would really like to just figure out how I can do it safely, with a professional, who can help manage my pain safely. I just cant justify keeping this baby with the factor of me being a year clean only; not having my kids, not having a car, like theres so many factors. I tried to keep this as short as possible. Im sorry. Does anyone have any other resources that might be able to help me? I filled out a form for a place about 30 mins away from me that does them with Local anesthesia.

My boyfriend is supportive of me terminating the pregnancy and has been kind of there for me in terms of my physical symptoms. He is no where near ready to be a father so I haven't brought up this conversation for him.

2025-03-15,1742030442.0,We both want abortion but my wife can't get over the fears from her beliefs. How can i help her?,"Hi guys,

I seriously need your help on this, and this is a long one.

We just got married, and we f'd up. We know this is our mistake and we are blaming ourselves for letting this happen.

My wife and I just found out she's pregnant a few days ago, just a month after our wedding. The scan we did yesterday didn't even show the embryo inside the uterus, so we still have time to decide what to do. It's very early. It's too early even to do a MA. Now our initial reaction and up to even now after a few days is that we are not ready to have kids. We still want to enjoy our lives and no matter how we go through the scenarios in our head and together, we can not imagine and cannot accept the reality that there will be a children in our life, at least at this time. We fully believe having a kid will more likely leave us with more suffering, and unhappiness. We've talked to great lengths about this and agree that we will be most happy and content with just each other.

But my wife is a firm believer in Buddhist teachings, and she believes that we'd be committing a major sin, akin to murder and she seems to be unable to overcome this to get the courage to make the final decision. And i don't know how to help her get through this. I believe that the decision we want to make will lead to less sufferings, and better for all parties involved. But I fear that if we decide to have an abortion, she will also not be happy and will be in tremendous mental pain and I don't know if she will even be able to heal from it.

We are also super torn due to the fact that other than our own selfish needs and the vision that we have for our life together, there's no other reason to have this abortion. We are happily in love, both our families are well off, incredibly kind, helpful to us and will be over the moon if we reveal to them about the pregnancy. There's no real financial strain to speak of to take care of the baby if we let this happen. In our culture people believe that having children is a blessing, so there's no chance of talking to anyone else in our families about this, because we will face massive judgements that will make it impossible to even speak about an abortion, so that leaves us alone to work this out.

I've tried to convince my wife that this is not a crime, and we are making this decision believing it will be best for our life together, that what ever is inside her right now is not yet a living human being, and if we make this decision with kindness in our hearts, there is no need to fear of guilt, karma or anything like that. But she is dismissing me everytime I mention it and doesnt want or unable to let go of her strong beliefs. I can see that she's in the middle of a crossroads and cannot find a way out that she can accept. She's in great pain, and I'm feeling it too.

2025-03-15,1742027301.0,Nervous! Question (and ramble) regarding GP,"So Im currently 7 weeks pregnant, if my workings out are correct.
Ive decided on an abortion as my partner and I just arent ready at this time - were looking for a bigger house as we are in a tiny house with no space for anything and we are trying to improve our quality of life.
I am an anxious person and I understand that having a baby is going to be stressful and an anxious time, and If we are going to do it at some point, I want to remove as much of that anxiety as possible. I feel having a bigger house and being in a space where we can do it at least removes some of that anxiety. I genuinely cannot see us with a baby in this space currently. 
I did come off the pill about a year ago as I didnt want to be on it anymore and at that point we sort of said just see what happens, but have been careful and used condoms where we could. Since then my anxiety/OCD has gotten worse and now its actually happened I just cant go through with it, for our sake and a childs sake.
I did go to my GP last week as I had some bleeding and cramps (which he said were normal) and the pregnancy was confirmed there and documented on my record.
I told him I was no longer on the pill and he asked me if I was keeping the pregnancy. I panicked and said yes as I was scared hed judge me when Id just said I came off the pill.
Now I have my consultation next week and Im worried that when the GP surgery finds out Ive had a termination that I will get in trouble.
I know you dont have to tell your doctor but as its on my record that Im pregnant, I dont want to turn up at a next appointment (whenever that may be) and they think Im still pregnant.
Any advice please?

2025-03-15,1742000033.0,22 Week Surgical Abortion Story,"I made a couple posts this week about my upcoming abortion and I was petrified so I wanted to share my story to hopefully calm others. For context I was 22 weeks on the dot and in California for the procedure. I also went to a planned parenthood.
I found out I was pregnant a month and a half before my abortion. I have super irregular periods, had no symptoms, no bump, nothing. When I found out I figured I was not far along and had an at home medical abortion that failed. I bled but my pregnancy test was never negative after that. I then decided to tell my boyfriend and my mom and booked an appointment at pp. My first appointment they ultrasound me and I was 21 weeks. I was in shock and soon after I started to feel him kick. They let me know it would be a two day procedure. I was terrified at first. I have extremely bad medical ptsd and am beyond terrified of doctors and needles. I did not sleep at all that week, but soon the fear of needles subsided and I was just sad. I spent a week feeling him kick. I felt like a mother and was so attached. I was two weeks away from the cut off in California and I made my choice for several reasons. Since I was unknowingly pregnant I was drinking for months and months while pregnant. I am also an avid vaper. On top of that I had the medical abortion. I could not live with myself if I brought a child into this world with chronic health issues, as that was what happened to me. I was put up for adoption and had chronic medical issues and hence the medical trauma. I felt I did not have enough time to check for health issues and I did not feel comfortable bringing a child into a world where I am not financially stable. I want to give my child the world and right now I was not capable of that. Me and my partner were adopted and know what the other side of that looks like so that could never be an option for us. I was overcome with grief but I knew what the right choice was, no matter how hard it was and still is. The first day of the procedure was the scariest for me. This was when they did the fetal injection to end the heart beat and did the dilation sticks. I was sick to my stomach over that shot, but I voiced that to my doctor and she could not have handled me better. She talked to me about my life the whole way through the procedure. The injection did not hurt, it was uncomfortable because I could feel how deep the needle was. The dilation sticks also did not hurt as she numbed me. The numbing shot was probably the most uncomfortable of them all but bearable. The next day I went in for the procedure and they knocked me out stone cold. I worked myself up for a lot of nothing. Medically it was not a hard procedure, emotionally it was. For anyone considering only you know the right decision for yourself.

2025-03-15,1742062747.0,Confused on logic and rights,"I recently did a deep dive and it left me confused. My issue is that I still don't have a genuine grasp on the logistics behind PL. I understand that PL views every fetus as a full-blown person with rights. However, rights come with the clause of not being able to take away someone else's rights no matter how small they seem in comparison. This should extend to the fetus if they are a full-blown human. That is where my logic leads me. Even if we take away the status of human with rights leaving them with just human life, the PP can still use their bodily autonomy to remove it. 


Furthermore, it's not the fetuses fighting against abortion it is born people. It's people with peens and uterus. By taking away one uterus owner's bodily autonomy you take away all bodily autonomy for current and future uterus owners. That is what having equal rights is about no matter how big or small the person is their rights are equal. If you give yourself the right to decide on someone else's behalf the same can be said in reverse. You cause a car accident and you're the perfect match for the person who got hurt you can and will be forced to save them. I understand being morally against something but you can't turn it into legislation that takes away rights from people currently alive and future generations. Jehovah's Witnesses don't believe in blood transfusions but they don't turn it into legislation because not everyone believes what they do and they would be taking away people's RTL. This is where my logic leads.  


In contrast, the PC logic seems streamlined to me. You have the right to bodily autonomy meaning you control what happens to or inside your body. If you end up pregnant and don't want to be you have the right to end that pregnancy. You end up pregnant and you want it congratulations hope you enjoy the journey. When applying the fetus has rights, not much changes. You end up pregnant and don't want to be, it's in your body and it can't take away your right to keep itself alive nor can any born person. You end up pregnant and you want it congrats on the pregnancy. It's beginning to feel more and more like your rights matter as long as there isn't a fetus involved.

2025-03-15,1742070086.0,"Do Women Have a Moral Duty to Keep Their Bodies ""Ready"" for Reproduction at All Times?","Late last year, Dr. Rebecca Gomperts (Aid Access, Women on Waves) announced results of a large clinical trial in Moldova, testing the use of a weekly low dose of mifepristone (50 mg) as a contraceptive. The results were promising, with only one pregnancy occurring within 2000 cycles. Furthermore, negative side effects were minimal, with only 4% of the participants experiencing any negative side effects (compared to a 40% negative side effect rate for conventional hormonal contraceptives). Additionally, the low-dose mifepristone was easier to use, requiring only one dose a week, and being more ""forgiving"" of variations in the time the pill is taken. And 89% of the study participants reported that they stopped menstruating while taking mifepristone as a contraceptive. (Probably most women would consider this a positive side effect.)

Because of the positive results, the trials have been expanded to the Netherlands this year. If the results continue to be positive, the plan is to apply to the European Medicines Agency for registration and market authorization to allow this weekly, low-dose mifepristone regimen as a contraceptive throughout the EU.

The method of action for mifepristone as birth control is two-fold: it reduces the rate of ovulation and it thins the endometrial lining of the uterus, making it impossible for a fertilized egg to implant.

([Source](https://msmagazine.com/2025/01/07/mifepristone-weekly-contraceptive-clinical-trials-abortion-pill-birth-control/).)

My primary question for PL supporters is this: 

* Would you have any moral or legal objections to women's use of such a contraceptive? If so, on what grounds?

Here are some secondary questions if you believe that the use of this contraceptive would be immoral:

* If a woman was taking mifepristone as described here *as a contraceptive* and informed her partner that she was doing this before they had sex, and if her partner, knowing this, decided to go ahead and have PIV sex with her, and if one of his sperm fertilized an egg but it failed to implant, whose would be the primary responsibility for the ""death"" of the fertilized egg? (Realistically, neither of them would ever know if this happened, so this is a hypothetical question.)
* *Men's* use of tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, red meat, and food high in trans fats during the months before their partners' conception is associated with higher miscarriage rates, because of these substances' impacts on sperm. ([Source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/a-mans-unhealthy-lifestyle-too-can-lead-to-his-partners-pregnancy-loss/articleshow/64072130.cms?from=mdr).)  If men engage in such unhealthy lifestyles, they are not maintaining their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction, and their choices could result in the ""death"" of a fertilized egg or even an embryo or fetus. Do they have a moral duty to maintain their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction by refraining from such lifestyle choices?",Abortiondebate,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jc47ep/do_women_have_a_moral_duty_to_keep_their_bodies/
2025-03-14,1741988561.0,"""Pretending"" to be PL, do I pass?","I almost wanted to make this post from an anonymous account to really make this a more authentic thought experiment but felt like that would be a pushing if not trampling sub rules so doing it like this instead. I'm tagging it as ""question for PL"" as its mostly aimed there, but there are a couple things for PC as well.

**What I want to do:** 

I will present a stance and arguments as if I am PL. I will do so to the best of my ability, providing multiple of the most reasonable arguments I know of. I won't go ham on ALL details, but enough as to get the gist of the reasons behind my pretend stance. It will still be in my own ""voice"" as a debatee though, and will not use arguments that I find completely bogus (religious, consent to sex is consent to pregnancy, appeal to nature, etc). So don't hold that against me. After I will ask a few questions. Keep in mind that that the idea of the post is not necessarily in the arguments I'm presenting themselves but more in my (and by extension other PC with similar view points) ability to understand the PL view. So here goes:

**The argument:**

During fertilization, a unique entity with human DNA is created. The exact point as to when this entity should legally become a person is hard to pin point as it can change due to technology and is subject to a lot of semantic and philosophical ideas regarding personhood and law. So, my go to is to err on the side of caution and say that it should be treated as a legal person from the moment its existence is known, i.e. fertilization. This seems as the more morally sensible choice as it is better to err on the side of giving the entity more rights, that of a legal person, rather than less and risk being in the moral wrong later.

From there, since we are talking about a person with the same rights as others. This includes the right to life, which should ensure that a person is not deprived of their life, or any other right, for that matter without due process. When abortions are legal, a female person is able for any reason kill the fetus, and thus taking away their right to life without due process. Although we allow killing in self defense, even after the incident is done there would be an investigation to determine if the lethal measure was justified. This happens whenever any person is killed. Without banning abortion, this investigation would never happen, and since I think there are times in which an abortion is an unjustified use of lethal force, it should in fact occur.

So, abortion should be banned with exceptions so that it is only used in certain cases where lethal force is justified. Specifically, when there is a particular medical reason that can be named by a doctor for having the abortion outside of that from ""normal pregnancy symptoms"". This is also in part because the fetus it self has done nothing wrong, as it is incapable of having intent and acting on it. As such, it would be a moral and legal wrong for them to be killed when they have not committed a crime. Although having the female person carry the pregnancy to term may have adverse affects for them, it is a greater wrong for the law to allow a person to be killed when they could have otherwise lived.

Although forcing female people to gestate against their will may be unfortunate as a side effect, the law should err on the side of keeping persons alive in this case. Especially since unlike organ donation they are forcing inaction, rather than forcing a procedure. The female could be compensated and their struggles alleviated, weather they be social, financial or otherwise, using other government programs instead of allowing them to kill the person causing them.

It is not ideal, but it is the better status quo than persons being killed for unjustifiable reasons without due process. As a society, we should strive for the over all well being of everybody, and killing a person who has done nothing wrong goes against that. Everybody deserves a chance at life unless there are severe extenuating circumstances and in vast majority of cases, a pregnancy by it self does not constitute those.

**The questions, geared toward PL:**

1. If you are PL, if you read this without knowing I am PC, would you believe I am PL? As in, do you believe I represented  your views and arguments, or at least ones close to your stance justifiably? If no, what did I miss or what gives me away?

2. If you answered yes to 1, then lets go back to the fact that I AM vehemently, no restrictions PC. Considering I, supposedly, understand and know your arguments enough to present them in a way you find acceptable, why do you think that is?

3. Are you in response, regardless of how ""accurate"" you think my ""post"" is able to provide a counter argument as if you are PC? If you do so, do you feel like you would be able to ""pass"" as a PC? Feel free to attempt to do so as answer to this question as well.

**More questions, geared towards PC:**

1. Do you think I ""pass"" as PL? If not could you do better and where?

2. If a PL person demonstrated the same amount of understanding of the PC stance as I have demonstrated about PL, why do you think they are still PL? (This is meant to be a mirror of question 2 for the PL, sorry for the weird wording)

**Both can answer:**

If you were to guess, who do you think would do better at this ""pretend to be the other side"" exercise, PL or PC?

Over time I warmed up the idea and decided Id be okay with one baby. Husband wanted three, but was glad I was open to one. We got married and after a year of trying I got pregnant with my little girl who is due in June.

Now tell me why this man is watching me suffer and is already talking about a second baby??
We had discussed right before I got pregnant that I MIGHT do two, but we dont know what pregnancy and parenthood will be like and Im not rushing to make that decision before we see what life is like with a baby.

He keeps saying the baby needs a sibling and he really wants a boy and a girl. I thought on it and decided under certain conditions I could be open to one more, definitely not three.

My conditions: 
1. We must be comfortable with the political and economical climate at the time specifically in regard to womens rights and maternal rights.

2. After breast feeding husband pays for a breast lift and tummy tuck if needed.

3. He must be okay with stopping at 2 even if we have another daughter. By stopping at 2 I mean he will get a vasectomy.

Husband is willing to accept 1-2 and says even if its another girl hed gladly stop at 2 babies so she can have a sibling. 

However, he says he will not get a vasectomy. I explained in detail how its reversible and much safer than me getting my tubes tied. He insists we can continue to use condoms and plan B as needed. I told him currently in the USA they are working to ban birth control, abortion, and plan b and we will have no fall back if I get pregnant at 40 which we both agree we wouldnt want another kid at that age.

Is this unreasonable? He says he doesnt want to mess with his downstairs and I rolled my eyes and reminded him what Im doing to my body for us to have a child.

My husband has been kind and taken good care of me through this, but I feel Ive compromised a lot and met him half way on our ideals with what our family will be like. Is a vasectomy really asking too much??

Edit: Id like to point out as there seems to be some confusion. Id never force my husband to have a vasectomy. Its simply a condition if he wants a second child which is something he wants.

2025-03-15,1742022263.0,CMV: Men are not obliged to empathize with women,"There has been a growing trend on Reddit blaming men for the recent election results, particularly those who voted Republican, third-party, or didnt vote at all. This criticism seems to stem from the assumption that men are obligated to vote in favor of women's interests, even when those interests may conflict with their own. It reflects a broader societal expectation that men should always prioritize empathy for women, often at the expense of their own well-being.

Consider these examples:

* A **homeless man** is expected to care more about abortion rights than policies that might improve his economic situationeven though abortion is largely avoidable through contraception, and cases of rape/incest account for less than 1% of abortions.
* A **divorced father with limited custody** is supposed to support policies that subsidize single mothers rather than advocating for equal custody rights.
* A **male victim of domestic violence** is often ignored due to legal frameworks like the Duluth Model, which assumes men are the primary aggressors. If he reports abuse, he risks being arrested or removed from his home instead.
* A **man falsely accused of a crime** is expected to accept the risk of wrongful imprisonment because prioritizing ""believing victims"" is seen as more important than his reputation and livelihood. For example, in India, men can be jailed for four days based solely on an allegation, regardless of evidence.
* A **single, lonely man** is expected to vote for parties that fund social programs benefiting nearly every demographic except young men, despite the ongoing male loneliness crisis.

At the same time, men who express the need for empathy or support are often dismissed as weak, entitled, or having a ""fragile ego."" This expectation of one-sided altruism is rarely reciprocated. For instance:

* When India proposed **gender-neutral rape laws**, feminist groups opposed them, arguing they could be used against female victims.
* **Erin Pizzey**, a pioneer in domestic violence shelters, was ostracized and received bomb threats after advocating for shelters for male victims.
* **Floridas National Organization for Women** actively opposed a shared custody bill, showing little concern for fathers' rights.
* **Earl Silverman**, who tried to establish a shelter for male domestic violence victims, was ridiculed and struggled to secure funding. He later died by suicide.
* During **World War I**, women publicly shamed men who didnt enlist, handing out white feathers to label them cowards, yet men were still expected to defend and protect society.

Given this pattern, I believe men should prioritize their own interests and direct their empathy toward those who will genuinely reciprocate it. The expectation that men should always sacrifice for women, without similar consideration in return, is unfair and outdated.

I am open to changing my view if presented with compelling proof that men, as a group, receive equal reciprocity in terms of empathy and policy considerations by the folks we are supposed to empathize with. If there are examples of significant legal or societal movements advocating for mens issues with the same degree as womens rights/privileges, I would reconsider my stance.

Edit:  
Some other examples of gender biased laws which affect men are affirmative action, Duluth model, family courts favoring women statistically, paternity fraud not being a crime, paternity tests being illegal in France, South Koreas women protesting to have men's military service compensation removed, India's entire list of gender biased laws etc.

Edit 2:  
Since nobody came up with any example, I myself came up with the example of Iranian men being obliged to have empathy for Iranian women given they have lesser rights in their country. Iranian women never protested for any rights of their men to be stolen. Iranian women are unfortunately not legally free, though culturally have sufficient rights as society doesnt support the theocracy. If I get a similar situation in US/UK or any country where women are completely free legally and culturally and have fought for men's rights to be restored or certain policies to be removed, I'll change my view.

2025-03-15,1742015399.0,"As one's faith grows...do certain fictional stories/genres feel inherently more ""Anti-Christian""","As I journey towards my Baptism into the Catholic faith I'm re-evaluating many things in my life. One of them is obviously the media I consume. ""Custody of the eyes"" is easy and obvious when talking about content that is incredibly explicit or gratuitous in nature. It's best not to view it is a pretty easy conclusion to come to.

I find that when dealing with pure fantasy(Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Dragon Ball) of ""elseworlds"" so to speak...that entirely different world with an entirely different set of rules often ""Works"" for my rationalizing mind. A story about Samurai hunting monstrous demons hundreds of years ago, that clicks. Fantasy.

But surprisingly, I'm finding the sci-fi genre to have an inherently atheistic/Non-Christian view about most things. It is always so much about discovering alien life, or alien life being a given reality, presented in ways that feel like they sort of fly in the face of the Christian worldview and our understanding of Biblical history.

Meaning in the sense that they are often very pro Evolution, anti-God/Faith in lieu of putting ""science"" first, and even sometimes want to be filled with ""alternative explanations"" for the origins of life, creation, or deal with God-like beings that supplant the notion of ""God"" in our world and timeline.

I understand all movies are fictional ""what if"" scenarios...but I'm beginning to have annoyed moments when it comes to how some of these things get portrayed or addressed.

I'm not one to be overly prickly when it comes to things like this, but sometimes it just doesn't sit well with me in the genre of heavy sci-fi films, mentally reconciling what's being portrayed, stated, and implied on screen with the Biblical timeline or other Biblical truths of our world.

It ends up pushing my interest either completely into fantasy fiction like the aforementioned Dragon Ball or LOTR...or it makes me have a preference for more plausible, ""real world"" set action films like Mission Impossible and others like it.

I assume most Christians here hold the view that God does not judge a non believing fetus the same as a fully grown non believing adult. No matter what for the fetus, he will send the fetus to heaven for eternity with him because the fetus doesn't have the capacity to have a belief in anything. So by this logic, abortion guarantees the soul of the fetus to spend eternity in the kingdom of heaven with God.... If you let the fetus grow up to be a human, statistically they have a large chance of Rejecting God and spending eternity in Hell.... Is it worth it to gamble on this? If you abort the fetus you ensure that soul is sent to heaven. It's the moral thing to do. Some of you might say ""thou shall not kill"", well even if it is, isn't this the ultimate sacrifice for ensuring eternal bliss of another soul in heaven?

I took my miso today at 2PM. After about an hour, the bleeding and cramps began. I passed several clots, and the cramps was also too painful. But, I am not sure if I already passed the fetus.

I am not 100% sure of how far along I am. My last period was last December 19. I took a PT by the end of January and it was negative. But, I experienced the symptoms and spotting around the 2nd week of February. I am aware that it is possible that the PT wasn't able to detect it yet in January because it's still early. And I only took 1 test that time.

So, if you count it based on my last menstruation, it would be around 11 weeks already. But, if I became pregnant in February, it's been only a few weeks. Therefore, it is possible that I won't recognize the fetus, right? =-

2025-03-15,1742062747.0,Confused on logic and rights,"I recently did a deep dive and it left me confused. My issue is that I still don't have a genuine grasp on the logistics behind PL. I understand that PL views every fetus as a full-blown person with rights. However, rights come with the clause of not being able to take away someone else's rights no matter how small they seem in comparison. This should extend to the fetus if they are a full-blown human. That is where my logic leads me. Even if we take away the status of human with rights leaving them with just human life, the PP can still use their bodily autonomy to remove it. 


Furthermore, it's not the fetuses fighting against abortion it is born people. It's people with peens and uterus. By taking away one uterus owner's bodily autonomy you take away all bodily autonomy for current and future uterus owners. That is what having equal rights is about no matter how big or small the person is their rights are equal. If you give yourself the right to decide on someone else's behalf the same can be said in reverse. You cause a car accident and you're the perfect match for the person who got hurt you can and will be forced to save them. I understand being morally against something but you can't turn it into legislation that takes away rights from people currently alive and future generations. Jehovah's Witnesses don't believe in blood transfusions but they don't turn it into legislation because not everyone believes what they do and they would be taking away people's RTL. This is where my logic leads.  


In contrast, the PC logic seems streamlined to me. You have the right to bodily autonomy meaning you control what happens to or inside your body. If you end up pregnant and don't want to be you have the right to end that pregnancy. You end up pregnant and you want it congratulations hope you enjoy the journey. When applying the fetus has rights, not much changes. You end up pregnant and don't want to be, it's in your body and it can't take away your right to keep itself alive nor can any born person. You end up pregnant and you want it congrats on the pregnancy. It's beginning to feel more and more like your rights matter as long as there isn't a fetus involved.

2025-03-14,1741988561.0,"""Pretending"" to be PL, do I pass?","I almost wanted to make this post from an anonymous account to really make this a more authentic thought experiment but felt like that would be a pushing if not trampling sub rules so doing it like this instead. I'm tagging it as ""question for PL"" as its mostly aimed there, but there are a couple things for PC as well.

**What I want to do:** 

I will present a stance and arguments as if I am PL. I will do so to the best of my ability, providing multiple of the most reasonable arguments I know of. I won't go ham on ALL details, but enough as to get the gist of the reasons behind my pretend stance. It will still be in my own ""voice"" as a debatee though, and will not use arguments that I find completely bogus (religious, consent to sex is consent to pregnancy, appeal to nature, etc). So don't hold that against me. After I will ask a few questions. Keep in mind that that the idea of the post is not necessarily in the arguments I'm presenting themselves but more in my (and by extension other PC with similar view points) ability to understand the PL view. So here goes:

**The argument:**

During fertilization, a unique entity with human DNA is created. The exact point as to when this entity should legally become a person is hard to pin point as it can change due to technology and is subject to a lot of semantic and philosophical ideas regarding personhood and law. So, my go to is to err on the side of caution and say that it should be treated as a legal person from the moment its existence is known, i.e. fertilization. This seems as the more morally sensible choice as it is better to err on the side of giving the entity more rights, that of a legal person, rather than less and risk being in the moral wrong later.

From there, since we are talking about a person with the same rights as others. This includes the right to life, which should ensure that a person is not deprived of their life, or any other right, for that matter without due process. When abortions are legal, a female person is able for any reason kill the fetus, and thus taking away their right to life without due process. Although we allow killing in self defense, even after the incident is done there would be an investigation to determine if the lethal measure was justified. This happens whenever any person is killed. Without banning abortion, this investigation would never happen, and since I think there are times in which an abortion is an unjustified use of lethal force, it should in fact occur.

So, abortion should be banned with exceptions so that it is only used in certain cases where lethal force is justified. Specifically, when there is a particular medical reason that can be named by a doctor for having the abortion outside of that from ""normal pregnancy symptoms"". This is also in part because the fetus it self has done nothing wrong, as it is incapable of having intent and acting on it. As such, it would be a moral and legal wrong for them to be killed when they have not committed a crime. Although having the female person carry the pregnancy to term may have adverse affects for them, it is a greater wrong for the law to allow a person to be killed when they could have otherwise lived.

Although forcing female people to gestate against their will may be unfortunate as a side effect, the law should err on the side of keeping persons alive in this case. Especially since unlike organ donation they are forcing inaction, rather than forcing a procedure. The female could be compensated and their struggles alleviated, weather they be social, financial or otherwise, using other government programs instead of allowing them to kill the person causing them.

It is not ideal, but it is the better status quo than persons being killed for unjustifiable reasons without due process. As a society, we should strive for the over all well being of everybody, and killing a person who has done nothing wrong goes against that. Everybody deserves a chance at life unless there are severe extenuating circumstances and in vast majority of cases, a pregnancy by it self does not constitute those.

**The questions, geared toward PL:**

1. If you are PL, if you read this without knowing I am PC, would you believe I am PL? As in, do you believe I represented  your views and arguments, or at least ones close to your stance justifiably? If no, what did I miss or what gives me away?

2. If you answered yes to 1, then lets go back to the fact that I AM vehemently, no restrictions PC. Considering I, supposedly, understand and know your arguments enough to present them in a way you find acceptable, why do you think that is?

3. Are you in response, regardless of how ""accurate"" you think my ""post"" is able to provide a counter argument as if you are PC? If you do so, do you feel like you would be able to ""pass"" as a PC? Feel free to attempt to do so as answer to this question as well.

**More questions, geared towards PC:**

1. Do you think I ""pass"" as PL? If not could you do better and where?

2. If a PL person demonstrated the same amount of understanding of the PC stance as I have demonstrated about PL, why do you think they are still PL? (This is meant to be a mirror of question 2 for the PL, sorry for the weird wording)

**Both can answer:**

If you were to guess, who do you think would do better at this ""pretend to be the other side"" exercise, PL or PC? And I don't mean by completely lying and using arguments one completely doesn't see the reasoning behind or imitating some voice or other but genuinely trying to make the argument for the other side like a devils advocate?",Abortiondebate,28.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jbf6um/pretending_to_be_pl_do_i_pass/

2025-03-15,1742041015.0,"Just had a surgical abortion, now Im grieving and scared","I live in America, TN. I was 24 weeks but traveled out of state for an abortion.

I genuinely wish I couldve kept the baby, but Im not married just yet, still with the father who helped me through everything.

Its been really hard for me because I didnt want to tell anyone I was pregnant but people at my work found out and it stressed me out because I couldnt let my family find out and I dont want the news getting back to them. Im a strong baptist but Ive always had more relaxed views of abortion because I understood the need for them to be here.

I went to an incredible clinic out of state that took care of my mental needs while handeling the abortion with such great professionalism and humanity. But its killing me not feeling my baby moving inside me anymore, not being able to hold her.

I didnt even think I could be pregnant. I used to be forced into prostitution and had an eating disorder and other medical conditions that doctors told me it would be impossible for me to get pregnant.

When I finally told the father he was so strong and supportive, helping me through everything. But the weight of everything leaves us numb. I hold my babys prints and blanket and just cry. How long does this pain last?! I know I dont deserve sympathy but it kills me.

My question is because people at work know and have been texting me asking if Im ok, and Ive been ignoring getting back with them because I dont want people knowing about it. But I know when I come back to work people are going to ask and its going to kill me.

What do I say?? Especially in the area I live, abortion especially at the time I had it are extremely frowned upon. And I dont want work to become hostile but they will all know when they see me Im no longer pregnant.

Whats a good line to explain even to my boss? That I miscarried?? What could cause such a late miscarriage? Could I get some advice please.",abortion,14.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jbttos/just_had_a_surgical_abortion_now_im_grieving_and/
2025-03-15,1742021468.0,is it weird that i am traumatised,"hey, me again. i posted before about the abortion when i first had it. its been over a year since i had the abortion and i was recently reminded about it because i accidentally saw the notifications that my boyfriend had told one of his female friends about my abortion and she judged me for not doing well for my exams a month after i had my abortion. i feel like as a woman, shouldnt u at least try to understand how i felt? i also feel that if u arent the one lying on the chair legs up and open on display and secured to the stirrups then u shouldnt judge me for being emotionally nerfed for my exams.

i think its quite safe to say that i am maybe still a bit traumatised from the experience. context: i had a surgical abortion at 3 months. i really wanted to keep the baby but was told not to. 

i know there are people out there dying from bombs everyday and im here, one year later, still thinking about the day i lost everything. 

not sure if ill ever get over this. i feel that if i do, ill be moving on from the one thing i loved most. but at the same time it crushes me every single time i think about it. i still look at my ultrasound scans. i carry them with me everyday because i cant bear to put them away. i hope things will be better.

I found out I was pregnant beginning of this year and had my abortion a week after finding out. I felt so de attached and empty for the first week then went through a few week where I was so depressed, lost, regretful. Looking back I should have asked for help or spoken about my feeling more with my close ones. 

 Anyways, I thankfully managed to get back to normal weeks after and I kind of stopped thinking about my abortion and baby. Fast forward to now, for the past few days all I think about is my very short pregnancy, my baby and I now again feel a need to have a baby. I really thought I have recovered and moved on but maybe I havent? All I see now is babies and pregnant women. I cant stop thinking and day dreaming about pregnancy and being a mother. 

Has anyone got any advice? To clarify dates I had my abortion in January and my depressive stage lasted about 3 weeks. I was really hoping to be completely okay with it months after. I think I am scared that I could potentially go back to being in such a dark place. I look back and its super scary how unaware I was of how sad I truly was. Everyone around me would ask and try to help but I didnt accept it. I wouldnt clean, would just daydream 24/7, shower very little, not say much for weeks so it was very bad. 

How can I make sure I do not go back to that? ",abortion,7.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jbutnu/feelings_coming_back/
2025-03-15,1742052802.0,Im terrified. I need help finding funding if possible. USA/PA/MD border kinda.,"Ive been searching for answers for weeks and weeks and the farther along I get, the more terrified I get. I have no friends. I have no family that cares about me. And I just feel like no matter where or who I turn to Im going to get judgement. About everything. I dont have my children at this time (I just got out of rehab and a recovery house a few months ago so still working on getting them back in my full care,) and that makes me feel even worse about getting pregnant. My boyfriend and I took a break, we were fighting A LOT, it was an almost three month break (up), and I stupidly got pregnant because the condom got stuck inside of me. Ive been trying to find funding for an abortion for weeks. I even went to a clinic that said they offered support which I misunderstood completely and I told them I didnt want to see anything. They end up doing an ultrasound, they had the audio on so I heard the heartbeat, and then they printed a photo for me to keep. They then at the end of the appointment told me they dont have the resources to help with abortion. Only prenatal, postpartum and adoption services. And then they kept me there for 30 mins telling me why I should follow through. So for two weeks it ate at me and ate at me.. but, I dont want to follow through. I want to get my own babies back first. They deserve so much better than what Ive given them in their lives. I called the national abortion fund and they told me as a head of household for one which Id technically be with me as a server making $2.33/hr and then $450/week I could not qualify for assistance. I dont see any of my hourly wages it gets garnished directly to child support for my children. So the $450 (if I make that) I have to pay the rest of my CS and get to and from work (i uber mostly as I dont have my own vehicle) I dont know where else to look. I dont want to do a Medication Abortion all alone especially not at 10 weeks+. I feel as if it will be traumatizing and it will make my mental health even worse than it already is and I do not want to relapse either because pain is a big trigger for me, so I would really like to just figure out how I can do it safely, with a professional, who can help manage my pain safely. I just cant justify keeping this baby with the factor of me being a year clean only; not having my kids, not having a car, like theres so many factors. I tried to keep this as short as possible. Im sorry. Does anyone have any other resources that might be able to help me? I filled out a form for a place about 30 mins away from me that does them with Local anesthesia.

2025-03-15,1742027301.0,Nervous! Question (and ramble) regarding GP,"So Im currently 7 weeks pregnant, if my workings out are correct.
Ive decided on an abortion as my partner and I just arent ready at this time - were looking for a bigger house as we are in a tiny house with no space for anything and we are trying to improve our quality of life.
I am an anxious person and I understand that having a baby is going to be stressful and an anxious time, and If we are going to do it at some point, I want to remove as much of that anxiety as possible. I feel having a bigger house and being in a space where we can do it at least removes some of that anxiety. I genuinely cannot see us with a baby in this space currently. 
I did come off the pill about a year ago as I didnt want to be on it anymore and at that point we sort of said just see what happens, but have been careful and used condoms where we could. Since then my anxiety/OCD has gotten worse and now its actually happened I just cant go through with it, for our sake and a childs sake.
I did go to my GP last week as I had some bleeding and cramps (which he said were normal) and the pregnancy was confirmed there and documented on my record.
I told him I was no longer on the pill and he asked me if I was keeping the pregnancy. I panicked and said yes as I was scared hed judge me when Id just said I came off the pill.
Now I have my consultation next week and Im worried that when the GP surgery finds out Ive had a termination that I will get in trouble.
I know you dont have to tell your doctor but as its on my record that Im pregnant, I dont want to turn up at a next appointment (whenever that may be) and they think Im still pregnant.
Any advice please?

2025-03-15,1742030442.0,We both want abortion but my wife can't get over the fears from her beliefs. How can i help her?,"Hi guys,

I seriously need your help on this, and this is a long one.

We just got married, and we f'd up. We know this is our mistake and we are blaming ourselves for letting this happen.

My wife and I just found out she's pregnant a few days ago, just a month after our wedding. The scan we did yesterday didn't even show the embryo inside the uterus, so we still have time to decide what to do. It's very early. It's too early even to do a MA. Now our initial reaction and up to even now after a few days is that we are not ready to have kids. We still want to enjoy our lives and no matter how we go through the scenarios in our head and together, we can not imagine and cannot accept the reality that there will be a children in our life, at least at this time. We fully believe having a kid will more likely leave us with more suffering, and unhappiness. We've talked to great lengths about this and agree that we will be most happy and content with just each other.

But my wife is a firm believer in Buddhist teachings, and she believes that we'd be committing a major sin, akin to murder and she seems to be unable to overcome this to get the courage to make the final decision. And i don't know how to help her get through this. I believe that the decision we want to make will lead to less sufferings, and better for all parties involved. But I fear that if we decide to have an abortion, she will also not be happy and will be in tremendous mental pain and I don't know if she will even be able to heal from it.

We are also super torn due to the fact that other than our own selfish needs and the vision that we have for our life together, there's no other reason to have this abortion. We are happily in love, both our families are well off, incredibly kind, helpful to us and will be over the moon if we reveal to them about the pregnancy. There's no real financial strain to speak of to take care of the baby if we let this happen. In our culture people believe that having children is a blessing, so there's no chance of talking to anyone else in our families about this, because we will face massive judgements that will make it impossible to even speak about an abortion, so that leaves us alone to work this out.

I've tried to convince my wife that this is not a crime, and we are making this decision believing it will be best for our life together, that what ever is inside her right now is not yet a living human being, and if we make this decision with kindness in our hearts, there is no need to fear of guilt, karma or anything like that. But she is dismissing me everytime I mention it and doesnt want or unable to let go of her strong beliefs. I can see that she's in the middle of a crossroads and cannot find a way out that she can accept. She's in great pain, and I'm feeling it too.

Furthermore, my husband is fantastic, wonderful, and supportive - but he is also the person who will 100% pass out at the first sight of blood (flashback to me picking him up off the floor after our dog cut their foot with moderate bleeding&.)

For some background, I have a wonderful relationship with my family/ in-laws and they will be very involved in our childs life, but I was raised very strictly religious and incredibly modest, so it seems odd for people who have constantly checked me for modesty my whole life and not wanted to even see my calves,

I am incredibly shy, modest, and introverted. I am a grown adult of decent fitness and literally feel uncomfortable wearing shorts in public, so no Im not excited to have an audience for this, husband included. 

Of course I dont want him to miss any part of his childs life, but I also dont want him to get hurt *when* he passes out and I dont want to feel like I am the one constantly looking over to make sure he is ok during this time. We have talked about it and he would like to be there but is also realizing he probably wont do well. Maybe for our next child, I myself dont know what to expect and want to do this my way, but will have my midwife present as my advocate.

I was joking that my ideal fantasy is to get to the hospital too early, they say its going to be a long time until delivery, so I tell my husband to go home and get some sleep or go to work for part of the day instead of sitting around, I pop this baby out and tell him to come back to meet his son when its all over lol

I feel that this is an intimate, intense, short period of life that I would like to have what little control over it that I can.

Just looking for anyone else who has felt this way or decided to deliver this way. 



TLDR; 
Want to deliver on my own in the hospital without an audience.

Any tips for setting boundaries for the delivery room?

Our families will be very involved and everyone is excited to welcome them,
I just dont personally feel that anyone needs to welcome this baby while they are still halfway between my legs.",pregnant,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jc0jkd/aita_for_not_wanting_anyone_besides_my_medical/

2025-03-15,1742010191.0,Can I stop eating for baby at 37W?,"TW diet and food 

TLDR because whiney and ranty, sorry : Im due any day now, does my diet still affect the babys development? 

Im normally a healthy eater and love to eat, but pregnancy has been hard on the diet front. Terrible nausea and food aversion during 1st trimester which caused weight loss, somewhat back to normal during 2nd, but the nausea returned by the 3rd along with acid reflux and indigestion, and I never experienced any cravings. Never in my life I thought that eating would become a chore. 

Ive been forcing myself to eat certain things that i particularly dont enjoy for the time being. I normally love flavorful stuff, herbs spices, etc but they all now cause nausea, now I can only have bland stuff. On top of that, Ive been trying to reduce acid and indigestion which means extra boring food, and I just try to eat to meet the minimum recommended macros because Im afraid Ill otherwise cause harm to the baby. To make up for possible lack of nutrients, Im taking so many vitamins and supplements including protein powder, and often thats enough to make me full. All in all, meal times have been stressful. 

Ive now reached 37 weeks and everything is uncomfortable but Im so thankful that things are looking good so far. My weight gain as well as the babys growth is well within the recommended range. At this point, it seems like all the major fStal developments have already happened, and Im far from malnourished. So Im wondering if it would be ok for me to eat more carelessly now for the sake of my own digestive comfort. I feel extremely heavy and exhausted all the time and no amount of calories is helping. It feels like theres no more room left in my body for any food. The baby is very energetic and moves constantly which is both comforting, psychologically and uncomfortable, physically, but I see this as a sign that hes well fed? So can I stop worrying about nutrition at this point? Obviously Im not talking about consuming alcohol and ultra processed trans fat. I just want to eat simple carbs in small amounts and be protein deficient for now until my appetite and digestive system goes back to their pre-pregnancy condition.

This clinic is within my insurance so I know people will say just go to another clinic but I dont have the means at the moment.

I know this is why they say to get to know the person youre having a child with. But I truly loved him when this all started. He is hardworking, stable, and secure. He provides and cares for me. He loves me in all the ways that he can. But I just dont feel happy anymore. 

He left for a business trip, so Im home alone and pregnant with a house maid. Life is comfortable enough. But I feel so lonely. So fucking lonely. I cry every night. He calls twice, thrice, as much as he can. But I just feel nothing. I feel numb. Maybe Im just depressed? Maybe Im just& lost. 

This is the worst time to feel this way. Im giving birth in 2 months. Im hoping its just a phase because hes gone. I dont think that I can do this alone. His flaws are shining bright when hes far away. I see all the ways I ache because of him and I see all the ways I will forever feel lacking because of him. Now more than ever. 

These business trips will always happen, they must. So I will be lonely again. But next time with a baby. I dont know if its better to have a sad mother or a hungry one. I know he will always provide for the child. He will never not send money my way to make sure the baby is okay. He will always visit. He will coparent well. He will be a good man.

Im a mess and none of this makes sense. Ive isolated myself to the point that I have no one to go to. Im exhausted. Im sad. Today I sat on the couch all day and when the sun set I went upstairs to lay down. 

I dont know what to do.

2025-03-15,1742022860.0,Cant forgive husband for asking for a paternity test.,"TW: loss.

We got married in December 2023. A month or so before the wedding I got off birth control and got pregnant right away. When I was around 7 weeks, my husband asked for a paternity test. It absolutely crushed me, I cried for hours and ended up bleeding. The pregnancy ended a few days later.

I had 4 chemicals after and got pregnant again in August 2024. That pregnancy ended in October 2024. The paternity test hasnt been discussed since and honestly I assumed he got over it considering me tracking each ovulation, making both of us go through many tests to figure out whats wrong, etc.

Long story short- I got pregnant again in November 2024 and am now almost 17 weeks. We had guests over a few weeks ago and I was discussing crazy pregnancy dreams and one of them was giving birth to a baby with a different skin color. Everyone laughed because the discussion was lighthearted but my husband suddenly said something like and then you wonder why I want to do the test. My jaw dropped and the other woman over got very defensive for me.

He brought up the subject again a few days ago and we got in a major fight. He says he doesnt think I cheated but that since this baby stuck, maybe I got inseminated behind his back as maybe his sperm didnt work. I offered to look at all medical records of mine and reminded him of being on a shit ton of medication to sustain this pregnancy.

He stands his ground and basically belittles me and any argument I have about this being hurtful. His main point is that he is a man and has no way of knowing the baby is his.

For context:
I work from home, literally never go out unless I have a female friend over. Never spend any nights away from home and take care of 3 dogs. I physically wouldnt have time to cheat nor have I ever considered doing that. My husband also works from home and has access to all my devices/location on my phone.

I dont know what kind of advice I am looking for. I have not forgiven him for asking for the first paternity test and am simply disgusted by his behavior. 

Edit:

I wanted to thank everyone for weighing in. So much food for thought, I am glad to know I am not overreacting. I already agreed to the test as long as it is done privately as I am deeply ashamed of having to go through it. I wont divorce my husband over this but I will do everything in my power to make him seek therapy that he goes to regularly and not a couple times like he used to.

Having read through all the responses I realize it is not a me problem but rather an insecurity of his that is being projected onto me and our son.",pregnant,149.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jbpmkf/cant_forgive_husband_for_asking_for_a_paternity/

On all the ultrasounds my doctor said how she's very active and since I started feeling her kicks (started quite late with me around 25 weeks), I can also tell that she's an active one.

But for the last ~36 hours she's completely silent. I felt like 1-2 really minor movements this morning, but other than that, nothing.

I know many babies have a growth spurt at 30 weeks and that can cause them to be move less. But as a mom I'm still worried, as it's so usual for her. I tried to get her to move, moved around myself and carefully massaged my belly to get a reaction from her, but so far nothing has helped.

Should I go to the hospital? Should I wait some more? I would be very thankful for some insight and advice on this =O

UPDATE: I had a CTG done and everything seems to be okay. Of course 5 minutes after starting the CTG, baby girl started kicking.

I'm currently waiting for an ultrasound to be on the save side, but the midwife said she expects me to be able to go home real soon.

Over time I warmed up the idea and decided Id be okay with one baby. Husband wanted three, but was glad I was open to one. We got married and after a year of trying I got pregnant with my little girl who is due in June.

Now tell me why this man is watching me suffer and is already talking about a second baby??
We had discussed right before I got pregnant that I MIGHT do two, but we dont know what pregnancy and parenthood will be like and Im not rushing to make that decision before we see what life is like with a baby.

He keeps saying the baby needs a sibling and he really wants a boy and a girl. I thought on it and decided under certain conditions I could be open to one more, definitely not three.

My conditions: 
1. We must be comfortable with the political and economical climate at the time specifically in regard to womens rights and maternal rights.

2. After breast feeding husband pays for a breast lift and tummy tuck if needed.

3. He must be okay with stopping at 2 even if we have another daughter. By stopping at 2 I mean he will get a vasectomy.

Husband is willing to accept 1-2 and says even if its another girl hed gladly stop at 2 babies so she can have a sibling. 

However, he says he will not get a vasectomy. I explained in detail how its reversible and much safer than me getting my tubes tied. He insists we can continue to use condoms and plan B as needed. I told him currently in the USA they are working to ban birth control, abortion, and plan b and we will have no fall back if I get pregnant at 40 which we both agree we wouldnt want another kid at that age.

Is this unreasonable? He says he doesnt want to mess with his downstairs and I rolled my eyes and reminded him what Im doing to my body for us to have a child.

My husband has been kind and taken good care of me through this, but I feel Ive compromised a lot and met him half way on our ideals with what our family will be like. Is a vasectomy really asking too much??

Edit: Id like to point out as there seems to be some confusion. Id never force my husband to have a vasectomy. Its simply a condition if he wants a second child which is something he wants.

I dont mind typically, since I know he struggles with sleeping. However now that Im deep in the third trimester, I need him to be available. And often during the night&he isnt.

2 weeks ago, I had very bad pains for an hour that stopped me from being able to switch sides or even get out of bed. I felt like a beached whale. I tried calling him and texting him, but his phone was on do not disturb and he didnt add me as a person to get through to him when I needed to. After about 20 mins, I was able to get up and crouch my way over to the room down the hall where I angrily woke him up. Bc hes such a disturbed sleeper, he anxiously started yelling what what what! At the top of his lungs at me. I was really upset, bc I felt when I needed him around for our baby, he wasnt there. He was angry for about ten minutes that I woke him up and was grumbling about how I get to nap during the day and he doesnt, but I wasnt having any of it. Respectfully I told him to shut his mouth and do/say nothing unless its about being there for me. Im Puerto Rican and I dont play that . Turns out the baby dropped 2 centimeters!

A couple days later, Im up in the am and hes still sleeping in. My 2 40 pound dogs are on me and Im so big I cant get them off. I try calling him, since I made myself a do not disturb contact and wouldnt you know, he put on his airplane mode! So I couldnt reach him regardless. His excuse was well I went to the other room at 6 am and I figured you were up and youd be fine. Suffice it to say, I was NOT happy. I told him he cant do this, that he needs to be reachable at all times, even if Im just downstairs. 
What if I fall? What if Im in pain again and cant move? What if the dogs wont let me get up? I said if he did it again, there would be big problems.

Now today, same thing. This time, he slept in the other room all night and the dogs are crying to be walked and Im texting/calling him..his phone is off. Im trying to yell for him..but he isnt hearing me. He also planned on waking up this am to go for a quick shake out run since hes running a half marathon tmrw. His mother is landing from Minnesota in a half hour and hes not up. I made it clear that we need to turn over the guest room for her, and need to sweep downstairs. I cleaned pretty much the whole house in prep for her yesterday. Went to Costco to do my final prep run for freezer meal prep for us, so he doesnt lose his mind cooking meals and making a mess bc I wont be able to help much, AND went to his race expo with him to pick up his bib and help him navigate it. Its his first big formal race and Ive ran multiple halfs and a marathon. So wanted to show my support for him.

Why is she coming? Bc he needs to go to a work conference for a week in Utah and the only way Id let him go is if he made sure someone was with me. Bc Im always tired and always need some help.

Am I being a brat or unreasonable to want my husband to not put his need for sleep over making himself available to me in my last month of pregnancy? He is other wise a wonderful husband during the day for the most part. Helps me clean the kitchen after I cook, will do some laundry, help clean the bathroom when I ask, walk the dogs when he can etc. He can be a little selfish from time to time with his day, but who cant? 

Im just getting so annoyed that I have to keep having this convo with him and Im debating telling his mother. Although I dont know what that will do..she tends to coddle him lol. Ive done a lot of work to get him to be less coddled lol. Ive also done a lot of work to get myself to a point where I dont just pop off on him. Being a New Yorker and Latina, thats my instinct. But he doesnt respond well to that and says Im being disrespectful and wont engage with me.

Sorry for the rant everyone. Any advice? Am I being nuts? Thanks!

Update: I popped off on him via text and told him Im telling both of our parents he keeps doing this. He said sorry and that his phone gets put on airplane mode automatically and its just habit. Well it wasnt a habit when he had it on do not disturb and we got into a fight over that right? Now that I can reach him through DND, now its a years long habit lol. I just told him that the fact that he didnt make it a priority to be cognizant of before bed shows how careless and selfish hes being.  I def got tough and rude with him and he told me to stop a few times, which promptly got met with a stfu >7<ý@. Now hes up and trying to check and see if Im ok.

This pregnancy has been 6 months of constant GI struggles and Im so tired. I was debilitatingly nauseous until about 20 weeks, and Ive also struggled with painful gas and heartburn. I barely slept last night bc of the gastric reflux and the impossible task of finding a comfortable position. Im still eating enough but its gotten to the point where Ive almost developed a fear of food. I dont know if its my organs shifting around or what, but lately things just hurt and burn (or maybe Im just hungry I dont know.) I find myself wondering if food will just make me feel worse, or sometimes its more like apathy, like Im just so tired of needing to eat so often. But then the stomach acid gets worse if I have an empty stomach, sometimes it wakes me up at night and I have to eat a bowl of cereal. I have woken up to myself choking on my own vomit/stomach acid more than once, despite sleeping popped up on pillows. I didnt know whether to label this post as a rant or seeking advice. I feel like the only thing that will help at this point is giving birth. I wish I could fast forward to the end. I try to remind myself at least I dont have other symptoms like sciatica (yet) or GD. I dont know. Im exhausted every day even though I dont really accomplish anything. Doing a load of laundry is a big task these days. I literally do not even remember what it feels like to feel normal, kindof like when youve had a cold for weeks and you cant even remember what it feels like to breathe through your nose (which funnily enough, Ive also had constant rhinitis since October.)

Maybe this is just a rant. I alternate between tums, gasx, Pepcid, etc its like Ive tried everything and it only kindof helps. Maybe Ill ask my OB for a refill of reglan bc it feels like food just sits and rots in me and doesnt move along like its supposed to. Pregnancy is just so sucky and hard and honestly lonely. I dont have any pregnant friends and my mom and MIL and husband are all supportive but its like idk what can anyone say? I hate how my mom hasnt been pregnant in decades and has clearly forgotten (or maybe really never experienced) how truly awful it is. Everyone just wants to celebrate how magical it is and meanwhile I hate this. Im so excited to finally be a mom and have my son, but everything else about this experience is ass. I have a feeling the third trimester is just going to slowly become more and more uncomfortable until I get to the point where I just want to do nothing but lay around like Jabba the Hut until my body decides its going to attempt to expel a whole ass human from my vajayjay.

At 37w I got what felt like a sudden outburst of a rash on my stretchmarks that only got worse and worse. Its now all over my stomach and spread to my butt!! Apparently, it's PUPPP, which I didn't even know existed!! I hit most of the markers for it: FTM, Huge baby, Male baby, and rapid weight gain. My doctor confirmed it was PUPPP this past Wednesday and shared his sympathies. He told me all I can really do is take an aveeno oat bath and take benadryl in moderation.

I spend so much of my energy trying not to rip my stomach apart scratching.
I've tried a lot. Sarna, benadryl, calamine lotion, witchhazel, oat baths, tar soap, cold compresses. 
So far the only thing that works is taking an aveeno oatmeal bath in lukewarm/cold water, using fragrance free cerave moisturizer, cold compresses, and not wearing clothes or getting hot. It's not a 100% change. I still itch after a bit, but it isn't usually the unbearable itching.

I was already happy my due date is approaching and now I really can't wait even more. Five days and I will be evicting my big boy. Hopefully this rash will heal quickly after.

2025-03-15,1742007283.0,35 weeks. Need advice. What do I do after a non-fault car accident leaves our family with no income?,"Hello. I am located in SC, United States. Throwaway due to us still being in legal proceedings with the Car accident. I am currently 35 weeks pregnant with our first, and I am high risk. My husband got into a car crash last week that has left him with a broken leg in two spots. The car was totaled, and the other party was cited as 100% at fault. We have no idea how he is alive but I am unbelievably amazed that he is. His recovery is looking like 4-6 weeks, with no surgery. This will be confirmed at various follow ups so unfortunately until he heals, I do not have an exact timeframe. I am grateful that this does not currently look like a long term injury.

We have done the correct things regarding the accident, such as reaching out to our insurance, the other driver's insurance, and a family friend's recommended personal injury lawyer. I am following the advice of my lawyer regarding the car accident, but I am looking for advice regarding how to pay our bills in the meantime. Due to the nature of his injury, this is looking like it will be a relatively long settlement period while he recovers. We expect a reasonable amount at the end of this.

At this time, we have one remaining vehicle that is paid off and are not worried about getting a second anytime soon. The car involved in the accident was in my father's name and he will be receiving the car settlement, not us. The injury settlement will be what I am going to receive at the end of this. We live paycheck to paycheck and due to my high risk pregnancy, I am currently off work. Prior to the accident, at the end of our bills we have $80 for gas, and my father/WIC are covering our groceries. My husband barely makes just enough for us not to be eligible for food stamps. I do not have any disability pay or paid maternity leave. My husband just started a new job two months ago and is not eligible for disability or paid leave. Following the accident, my husband is unable to complete training at this time and is going to be placed on unpaid administrative leave until he is cleared by his doctors to continue training. I understand that in the settlement this will all be paid for due to the lost wages, but in the meantime, we are trying to not have our house foreclosed or our lights turned off, or bills go to collections. I have tried applying for a personal loan and we were denied due to lack of income. He has two small credit cards, and I have one small credit card (total credit borrowed less than $2,000). They are all at about 90% of max. We were denied for all credit increases due to paying the minimum amount and not more. We have been denied opening new lines of credit due to lack of income at this time. We are as prepared as we can be for the baby, and I plan to return to work as soon as I am able.

We do not have any friends or family with the funds to pay our mortgage and bills in the meantime while we wait for the settlement money.  Our church paid our mortgage and electric bill in January when I was put on unpaid maternity leave. I am trying to reach out to other churches and associations in our area but unfortunately most of the population is struggling in this economy and there's only so much money to go around. We have filed a deferment for the mortgage but it is not looking like they will give us more than a month. We already did a loan modification in January which was screwed over by an increase in escrow anyway. We are not eligible for another modification anytime soon. Our monthly expenses are not that high. Total is less than $3,500 a month for mortgage, bills, and utilities.

At this point, I feel like my only option is go fund me and pray. Our community has been wonderful, neighbors and friends helping me with chores, etc. so it's really just figuring out how to pay our bills in the meantime.

Can anyone please give me advice on how to proceed? Is there an option I'm missing? To reiterate, I am not asking anyone here for money, just advice. I'm terrified of being foreclosed on with a newborn because of this car accident.",pregnant,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jbllja/35_weeks_need_advice_what_do_i_do_after_a/

Until now, she has come to visit me once, never texted or asked me about my conditions, said she would visit us but cancelled last minute twice. 

Today is my parents wedding anniversary, she told us to come for dinner but I said we would come over for lunch because I have other things. I came and she said she didnt know I would not be staying for dinner. I told her I had work that I cant miss, Ive been very stressed out about work that I woke up at 2am and cant fall back to sleep for several nights already. I was exhausted, the house was small there is no room for me to rest, so while my parents took afternoon nap in their room, I had to lay on the floor in the living room. I ended up leaving around 3pm because I didnt want to torture myself.

My husband and I are very private person, we dont like having other people in our house so we purposefully only built two rooms, one for home office and the other our bedroom. When my mom told me she would come over to stay, I told her we didnt have a room, and she said why built such a badly designed house. She wanted me to do postpartum confinement for at least 2 weeks without touching water (meaning no shower), and I said no. The argue only ended with my dads intervention telling my mom her way was very old-fashioned and not suitable anymore. I told her Ill let her know if I needed help, but Im not making any arrangements for now.

The thing is, I know my mom cares and her love language is food, but she talks too loudly and too much, and her obsession with food drives me nuts. Whenever I talked to her about other things, she brushed them off. I had so much childhood trauma with my mom I cant bring myself to be open with her anymore.

When I was a kid, I told my mom my hair was falling out but she didnt care until I was almost bald. She laughed at my handmade gift to her and told me it was ugly. In uni I asked her to bring home (southeast asia) some pottery and glass I made and treasured very much, she left them at my cousins house in the US. When I asked to move out because I didnt feel comfortable living together, she threatened to cut ties because she was afraid of what others might say. She never said sorry to me once. Honestly, I dont think my feelings matter much to her. Shes controlling, and loves my brother because he would listen to her demands all the time. I have stopped telling her anything going on with me because she would brush them off, telling me we earn a lot of money so those are not really problems.

Im afraid my relationship with my mom will affect the relationship with my child, and I really want to have a loving, open relationship with my mom. I know its two-way, Im also part of the problem as Im too independent and like spending time alone. I feel more at ease to be with my cats than with my mom because I dont have to talk or entertain them. I know my mom will be a great help once baby comes, but I cant bring myself to ask her anything. Im afraid Id be too annoyed at her and make myself even more tired. Please share any tips or advice, and Im so sorry for the long post, I just needed to get this out of my head.",pregnant,6.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jbs320/i_want_to_improve_relationship_with_my_mom_but_i/

As far as I know it was emotional cheating only but probably lots of sexting, etc. Anyways I broke up with him immediately after and that was two weeks ago. For more context, I went off the pill in July and have been extremely irregular since then, so I thought I was likely infertile until my cycle went pack to normal. Regardless, we had been extremely careful. We used condoms every single time except LITERALLY ONCE. This was back in December. I took a pregnancy test today because I have been abnormally bloated recently and thought I should to be safe. It was positive. I have had basically no other symptoms which is wild because I now am at around 3.5 months. Obviously I am freaking out. I have always been pro choice but anti abortion if that makes sense. However I am not in a situation (life or financial) where I am ready to be a single parent, and I believe that is what would happen if I went through with this. It is crazy to me that some people try for years that want a baby and some people get pregnant by a one time fluke. Life is cruel sometimes.

We were told at our first growth scan last thrusday that I am still in the normal levels but my amniotic fluid is mildly increasing (Polyhydramnios). My baby is/was currently in the vertex position and is moving around just fine however with the increase of fluid i worry he will flip again. My placenta is also fine according to the scan. babies' heartbeat is also fine. According to our OB baby is weighting at 4.4lbs which is big for 30wks. My patient chart states that baby is measuring at 33wks instead of 30wks which my OB did not address with me but did question if me or my husband were big babies. We were 7lb and 8lbs at birth. She told me to come back in 2wks for a follow up and then in 4wks for another growth scan.

2025-03-15,1742060638.0,Baby Shower with just my side and friends?,"Im sorry this is going to be long. Please indulge me and let me know if Im rushing to judgment. The women in my husbands family (MIL and SIL) are a nightmare. We got married this past summer and MIL and SIL made it a nightmare. When my husband and I were dating, I liked them fine and I thought they felt the same, but when we got engaged, I felt like they turned on me and I still dont know why. 

They did nothing to help and showed no interest in my shower, bachelorette, rehearsal dinner, or wedding, despite my making the giant mistake of asking SIL to be a bridesmaid, which she accepted. 

SIL lied about being sick the day before my bachelorette to avoid having to go after being late to pay my sister for her share and completely ignoring the bachelorette and bridesmaids group chats for months. She was so sick she couldnt make it, but went out to a bar the night of while we were celebrating and posted pictures. When I confronted her about that, she told me she was hungry and had to eat something. My husband said something to SIL and MIL that SILs behavior hurt my feelings, and MIL took SILs side. 

After that, I lowered my expectations to zero with these people. Despite that, 36 hours before my wedding, SIL and MIL texted me to ask if 24 year old SIL could bring a friend to the wedding. I responded as nicely as I could that unfortunately no, as the seating chart and place setting counts had gone to the coordinator and caterer already and the signage and details had been finished, so there was no room for last minute additions. I got K in return. Not to mention that SIL had in fact been invited with a plus one but never RSVPd at all or mentioned wanting to bring anyone. 

After that, MIL and SIL retaliated by showing up late to our rehearsal, refused to participate and opted to sit outside the chapel with bitch faces on during rehearsal, then continued acting outwardly bitchy to anyone and everyone throughout the rehearsal dinner. 

The day of our wedding, MIL told my husband she would not be coming and he spent the morning having a huge fight with her until she was satisfied to show up. MIL behaved fine enough at the wedding. SIL did piss me off by changing out of her bridesmaid dress the second the reception started and instead deciding to wear a clubbing style body con mini dress, which was a choice. I ignored MIL and SIL on our wedding day, as I found it and still find it unforgivable to threaten not to go to your childs wedding, regardless of whether you end up showing up. 

The day after our wedding, I sent MIL a text saying that her behavior in the months leading to our wedding hurt me and took away from mine and her sons joy, specifically that her behavior at the rehearsal and rehearsal dinner embarrassed us and our other guests and that I resented having to play nice and encourage my husband to keep the peace throughout the summer when I would not accept that type of mistreatment from anyone else in my life, nor should he. I told her I felt we needed to have a conversation and that I felt I needed an apology before engaging with his family anymore. She blocked my number in response and then SIL sent me and my husband a text saying that my text to MIL upset her so much that SIL feared MIL would have a recurrence of breast cancer. 

My husband and I stopped speaking to his entire family after that, except for his father, who tried to play peacemaker with my husband for several months. The week before Christmas MIL and FIL invited us over to talk things out. I was shocked that MIL broke down in tears and profusely apologized. We accepted her apology and I felt it would be a nice gesture to say that I regretted texting her instead of speaking in person (honestly I dont feel that way  what I said was fair and was an invitation to a face to face conversation imo but I figured it wouldnt hurt to give something to get something). SIL never apologized for anything, and I never attempted a conversation with her. Shes honestly so selfish that I dont see the pointI was fine to just act like it didnt happen,  assuming she treated me fairly going forward. 

I am now 13 weeks pregnant, and we went over to MIL and FILs to announce babys gender and name to them with a blue ice cream cake last week. It was a pleasant time. Afterwards, my husband texted his brother and sister a photo of the cake to announce to them as well. SIL did not respond or acknowledge it. My husband is pissed (so am I) and went to MIL and FILs this morning, where SIL also lives, and asked SIL why she didnt respond. She said she doesnt look at or respond to group chats. He asked So you dont have anything to say to me or my wife when we tell you news like this? She said again she doesnt look at group chats. Husband called her some not nice names then started to leave. MIL overheard the argument and again took SILs side. My husband asked MIL why she would get involved when the last time she did the same thing and it broke up the family for months and he doesnt want that to happen again because their relationship has improved so much. MIL told him she doesnt think her relationship with him is good and she is still hurt by the wedding falling out. My husband left and called me to tell me what happened and that he wants to go back to not having them in our lives. 

I am so livid at these people. I dont want them in my sons life when he gets here and I dont want them anywhere near another event thats supposed to celebrate me that they can make about themselves. My shower is a while away still (July) but I am really wanting it to be just for my side and our friends. The only women on my husbands side that would be invited in good times are MIL, SIL, husbands brothers wife and her daughter, and husbands step-grandmother. The rest of his side lives across the country and we dont keep up with them. Husband isnt close with step-grandmother so I dont think hed care about that. I dont want to put my husbands brothers wife, who I get along with fine but am not close with, in the middle of the drama (I think shed take MIL and SILs side honestly) so I think I should just cut his side completely. It really upsets me that they feel ok to treat us like this at every turn. Its sick. I worry about them making my son feel like a second class family member someday because thats how they make us feel.",pregnant,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jc0o0a/baby_shower_with_just_my_side_and_friends/

It has really made me worry a lot. I feel so terrible for her she has 4 children already but has had a few miscarriages before, she is dealing with it really well considering, bless her soul. Its just made me concerned for the wellbeing of this baby, I have an appointment on Wednesday with the GP but will not have a scan until a few weeks from now. I am constantly nauseous I mean 24/7 if Im not nauseous I am asleep. I feel genuinely exhausted all day I can barely get up, my whole back hurts constantly.

I have recently lost my mother too who was like the pregnancy guru she had 6 daughters and 20 grandchildren and was present for almost every birth.

2025-03-15,1741998336.0,C-section rescheduled day of,"Today was supposed to have been my scheduled C-section. I (32 female 39 weeks and 5 days pregnant) had everything, literally everything, I could think of done, cleaned, prepped and figured out. So of course the day prior my fiancé comes down with an illness. Mind you I've been extremely hyper vigilant on avoiding any illnesses this entire pregnancy. I wear disposable gloves and use Lysol wipes at the grocery store, avoid crowded events and stay away from people who are experiencing any symptoms. 

Yesterday morning my fiancé woke me up to tell me he was ill so I had him take a 3 panel at home test for COVID19 and flu A&amp;B. Everything came back negative. I noticed that my throat was starting to feel sore as well so I called the labor&amp;delivery department where my csection was scheduled as well as my obgyn. They both said to just come regardless and even though my fiancé is sick with fever, chills, head/body aches, congestion and runny nose he could still come too. Of course we would need to take proper precautions though. 

I continued to finish my preparations last night with the hope that this was just the RSV, that I'm vaccinated from, currently going around but still i woke up this morning with extreme anxiety. Looking at my s.o. hardly able to stand I asked him to take another test. He did and tested positive for flu A. Mind you my fiancé isn't the greatest at self awareness. He has been constantly coughing into his hands and touching everything. The pets, grabbing silverware, light switches, door knobs and cabinets. I'm trying to stay as calm as possible repeatedly disinfecting things behind him and kindly suggesting that he frequently washes his hands, coughs into his shirt and avoids touching everything. 

I felt like my fate had already been sealed and I was about to have a C-section then come down with the flu with a newborn and have no one to help with the baby and C-section recovery. My fiancé is like the typical manly man that gets taken out by illnesses. Nothing against him but I know I wouldn't be able to rely on him to safely take care of the baby while avoiding transmission. So I called labor/delivery and they said they'd have my obgyn call me. He never did so I prepared to go in anyway and once I got there they had him on the phone and he said let's just go ahead and reschedule.

I was initially at first relieved because I can't handle the thought of doing all of this alone while sick. The thought of a newborn with the flu feels like a nightmare. Now I'm reading that pregnancy with the flu can cause still births. I am just so torn because my only concern is our baby and I worry if I made the wrong choice. I'm not sure exactly what I'm asking for on here. Maybe some shared experiences and advice. I wouldn't be able to live with myself if anything happened to my baby girl. My anxiety has been dragging me all over the place. Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read and respond to this.

2025-03-15,1742059544.0,"22 weeks pregnant, ignored, dismissed and neglected by multiple clinics and the ER","First I want to start off by giving some background about me. Im a navy medic, I have my EMT license, I taken courses to improve not just emergency medicine but also outpatient clinics. In the last two years, Ive worked in medical research, surgical department, dentistry and paediatrics. My husband is also a medic but a little different where his focus is on tactical/emergency medicine. 

I do not like asking for help, no matter what it is so when I do ask, it means Im at my wits end. Last night was the first time I felt at my absolute lowest point and the last time I felt this way, I was 16 terrified my dad was going to really kill me. He was abusive and had strangled me and I fully accepted that I was going to die but he let me go and it took me a long time after that, after running away and even as an adult to learn how to not jump at the sound of a door opening or closing or to forgive him at a distance. 

Last night, I woke up from the worst cramp in my lower calf and it didnt go away for 20 mins. This wouldnt have worried me so much if it wasnt the 6th time I had generalised cramps that day. I woke up screaming in pain and I called my husband for advice (hes on deployment). In my mind, the worst thing to me was a deep vein thrombosis as Im currently on aspirin to prevent blood clots. I also have hypertension and have been prescribed labetalol and also on anxiety meds. I was going to call an ambulance but I work at this hospital and I didnt want anyone I work with to know I went in. I was in so much pain and I was so scared. 

Neglected: 
I went to the ER front desk hyperventilating and crying in pain. I told them I was having severe cramps in my leg and im 22 weeks pregnant. They told me I need to go to labor and delivery and I was so confused but I was like ok I just need to be seen. THEY SEND ME WITH ONLY DIRECTIONS WHEN IM CRYING AND AUDIBLY DISTRESSED AND IN PAIN TO FIND L&amp;D WHILE WITH AN OBVIOUS GAIT. Little to say I did not find the department and I broke down. I really did not know how to help myself, I left my phone in the car thinking I need to make sure my baby isnt being affected so I couldnt just call for help. I was found by a group of nurses who took me back down to the ER and there was no apology from the front desk. As someone who works in medicine, this truly made me disgusted at the type of treatment patients receive. I then was sent to a room where the nurse was very accomodating and helpful until her turnover. The only thing I will mention is she did not review my medications and questioned why my bp was so high. I had to tell her. After the turnover, no one checked up on me. My monitor was beeping to my bp that was 140s/110s and my pulse in the 120s range. My drip was completely dry and at that point I really needed to use the bathroom. No call button in sight, no one walking past to flag down so as I know how to disconnect myself, I just did it anyway because no one was going to help me. 

I felt like the doctor did listen to my concerns but the ER is to make sure youre not dying so when my labs came back normal, there was nothing more she could do for me which I understand. 

Ignored and dismissed: 
This was not the first time Ive asked for help this week. I was burnt out and went to sick call/ acute care to ask for help for my mental health. I have only been getting 3-4 hours of sleep on average a night the past week due to work load. I was dismissed by sick call by the technician because it was not an acute issue and to schedule with my primary care provider. 
So ok, look at the schedule. Zero availability for the next two weeks which is fine really, if I wasnt about to move cross country in 2 weeks. So after I got dismissed by that clinic and I didnt know what to do but knew I needed help, I went to behavioural health requesting for triage and just like that, no providers were available for triage. If I had not been pregnant, Id honestly consider jumping off the roof at that point but the only reason why I wanted help was because I wanted to make sure my baby was not affected negatively. So since they couldnt help me, I broke down in front of a doctor at work who happened to be a psychiatrist and actually helped me which I appreciate and he was able to speak to my leadership and set somethings in motion.

After 6 hours and monitoring baby/cervical check/urine/feeling stomach they just moved an ultrasound date up and sent me home. Still had them for the remainder of the day.

Today I'm fine but wondering what it could have been? I didn't experience it with my first at all and from what I know it seems too long of a duration to be braxton hicks? Is it something I should be concerned about.

I recently found out that I am pregnant. This is a throw away for obvious reasons..I DO NOT want the father to find out this was ever a thing...... We live in a small town, and I am afraid to get it done anywhere he may hear about it.  He has ""joked"" before that if I ever got pregnant and he found out he would lock me in the basement until it was too late to terminate..... Like I get that it's a joke but that is completely terrifying. I guess that is what happened when his mom had him... If I am able to get it done and he finds out after, I fear he may react violently..  We recently broke up, and he has been calling me non stop alternating between angry and crying, Trying to get me to come over to talk to him. 
I am planning a week long trip out of town two weeks from now. The hotel is going to be expensive, and gas...After looking up the cost of the procedure, I do not know how I am going to be able to afford this ..... Is there any sort of organization that may help with the cost? I am freaking out. I am already about 4 months along, my periods are irregular to begin with and I had no idea until 2 days ago that l 8 was even pregnant..  is there any sort of at home type thing I could use ? Maybe if I just stay in my car and forgoe the hotel I can get closer to affording it? I don't know what to do :'( I am afraid it will be too late by the time I can save enough to afford everything.... I don't know if I should resort to selling myself to get it quickly, or maybe I deserve to have to have the baby since it's my fault :( if I can't get this done I am going to have to move back in with him....

2025-03-15,1742044973.0,"23w pregnant, caught covid, taking care of a ladie's pets for 2 weeks, constant dog walks and taking care of bf after surgery. What to do?","It all started when I was taking care of my neighbors pets, 2 rabbits, a cat and a wild pond turtle. After 3-4 days of taking of them, my ""allergic reaction"" to the Timothy hay got worse one night and so I went to the clinic to see if there was anything to do about it. Came back positive for Covid. Bf had major ACL/ meniscus surgery the next day and wasn't going to miss it as he's been waiting for a long time to get this procedure done.

It's been a week since the surgery. All the while I'm up taking the dog out on walks bc we live in an apartment so 3-4x a day and I try to be generous and try to be outside for least 10 min, and go to the field nearby to play fetch 2x a day. 

Taking care of the ladies pets, i live in the same building. I come by 1-2x a day. I've had to clean the cat box and need to do it again. She doesn't have a filtration system for the turtle tank and the bunnies would be stuck in a small cage if I wasn't paying attention to them. I've debated to invest my own money to get them set up better. Right now I'm even trying to potty train the rabbits. One is a boy and a girl and I've been trying to find somewhere cheap so she could get them fixed. It's stress I don't need but the lady is super nice and she's offered late night assistance once the baby is born and I believe she would help me. She can take care of a cat but I know she got bunnies and the turtle for when her granddaughter was living with her.  She's offered to have her friend take care of them and for the daughter to take the bunnies but I'm like it's only 3 days left, and I don't want any of the animals to rot in their cage. 

I'm trying to help my bf. He is pretty independent. I open the door, put his sock on or try to make him comfy. I helped him get on a schedule for his medication because it was very complicated and wanted to help him stay on track. I feel unloved a bit, I want to fit the ottoman into the couch but he tells me he doesn't want to struggle to get off the couch and I told him that I would move it if he needed to get up.....he's tried to be affectionate from time to time but his reasoning not to cuddle just sounds like an excuse. It makes me feel sad. 

I'm running around doing all this and my cough has only gotten worse and I've had a few hours of sleep. The last time I slept in, was till 11 am and he thought I was being lazy. I told him I  wasn't feeling good, but I was okay and that I thought it was only allergy symptoms. That day I remembered I had light sensitivity but blamed it on sinus congestion. 

I type this with a few hours of sleep. I can't sleep. I feel bad for my lil baby bc I'm constantly coughing and idk how much sleep he's getting. I still have an appetite but my stomach hurts on occasion. I've tried delyseum to get rid of my coughing but nothing. Now I'm worried it might some how be a bacteria in my system. I'm not congested but I'm constantly coughing with an occasional rattle when I lay on my side.  At one point I coughed and I threw up, and wished my bf would comfort me a little bit more. I'd start gagging over the sink and maybe once he asked me if I hit the inhaler.  coughing has only gotten worse. Has there been anything else safe to take to combat Covid symptoms?

Tomorrow I have to do laundry bc our dog has wet the bed twice. And the couch 3x. She needs to see a vet about her incontinence but bf keeps delaying it. My bf is frustrated but we both know she can't help it. I'm just overwhelmed. We're both sick.

2025-03-15,1742059054.0,CMV: The only reason why Trump wants to annex Canada and Greenland is because the Arctic is melting,"I don't understand why he doesn't just come right out and say this. He's said some vague things, like for ""national security"" or ""international security"":

Maybe an admission that the Arctic is melting might mean he'd have to acknowledge global warming is real, and it would upset his supporters who also believe it's a hoax. He's said many, many times it's a hoax:

He did kinda change is mind once though sort of:

And if he says it's real now, or even acknowledges the Arctic is melting, he'd have to admit he was wrong all those times before.

Regardless, the Arctic is melting, which means access to untapped resources and trade routes:

[https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2022/09/13/what-lies-beneath-melting-glaciers-and-thawipermafrost/](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2022/09/13/what-lies-beneath-melting-glaciers-and-thawipermafrost/)

Guess who has better access to all those resources and trade routes? Canada and Greenland. This is why he wants Canada to become the ""51st state"" and buy Greenland. r/Conservative had a literal article on their sub about Canadians who are thrilled to become part of the U.S. (it was from the Telegraph, UK) because I think they're trying to warm people up to the idea. Some of the comments on there were like, ""Okay, Alberta might be all right, but nobody else!"" But most posts over there about this subject are full of Conservatives that are flabbergasted and even kind of mad about his threats. It's not really popular even with them.

But the exact reason is Trump wants the resources in the Arctic and the trade routes. Period. And rather than just continuing friendly and peaceful relationships with the nations who have access to those resources, he'd rather just take away their sovereignty and make them part of this country, so they don't have control over them anymore.

I know he says a lot of things, and then will say the opposite of those things thirty seconds later, but he's kind of started to suggest global warming is good or beneficial:

[https://www.eenews.net/articles/trump-to-musk-climate-change-means-more-oceanfront-property/](https://www.eenews.net/articles/trump-to-musk-climate-change-means-more-oceanfront-property/)

I believe he's saying those things because melting ice, not just in the Arctic, but in Antarctica too, would mean exposing resources that could make a nation--or an individual--very wealthy and powerful.

I don't know if he wants to get those resources for himself, his businesses, his family, or his billionaire friend's like good old Elon. Or he thinks if he gets this for the US, he'll be praised for it and it will be his legacy. And if the U.S. has direct access and has control over that area, it would mean certain types manufacturing and businesses would come back to the U.S., like he promised to do, especially if they can get stuff like rare earth minerals, natural gas, and oil. I don't know. It could be a combination of all those things.

But the point is that he wants Canada and Greenland because of the Arctic's resources. That's what he wants. I tried to find somewhere where he's actually said this, aside from ""drill baby, drill"" but he hasn't. Aside from the vague things about security mentioned above, and opening up Alaska for more oil drilling, that's about it.

Most news stories about Trump's threats to Canada and Greenland are super vague about it too or don't even mention it at all, but that is absolutely what it is. And, yeah, there's definitely a domineering colonizing, ""might makes right"" element to the whole thing, but the Arctic's untapped resources and trade routes are why he's doing all this.

I don't think it's for any kind of security b/c why not just take Mexico? If him and Conservatives believe that illegal immigrants crossing that border is a security threat, why not just take the whole country over? Or El Salvador or Honduras while they're at it? I don't believe he's using it as leverage for trade, because wouldn't that sort of move be best focused on somewhere like China? Even Trump's merch is made in China, and since they're the world's factory now, and he wants to bring all that manufacturing back to the U.S., you'd think he'd leave our neighbor to the north alone and focus on the country that we buy most of our shit from. I know he's put tariffs on them too, but they're only, what, like 10%? A lot less than Mexico and Canada. And does Denmark even have any sort of negative impact on U.S. trade? I'm pretty sure they get a lot of stuff from us, so how could that be motivator for a trade war? Those things just don't seem like good reasons. I know he's not known for being a thoughtful planner, but still.

Change my view and let me know what other reason there could be? I really think getting the resources and trade routes in the Arctic is the only reason.

2025-03-15,1742030442.0,We both want abortion but my wife can't get over the fears from her beliefs. How can i help her?,"Hi guys,

I seriously need your help on this, and this is a long one.

We just got married, and we f'd up. We know this is our mistake and we are blaming ourselves for letting this happen.

My wife and I just found out she's pregnant a few days ago, just a month after our wedding. The scan we did yesterday didn't even show the embryo inside the uterus, so we still have time to decide what to do. It's very early. It's too early even to do a MA. Now our initial reaction and up to even now after a few days is that we are not ready to have kids. We still want to enjoy our lives and no matter how we go through the scenarios in our head and together, we can not imagine and cannot accept the reality that there will be a children in our life, at least at this time. We fully believe having a kid will more likely leave us with more suffering, and unhappiness. We've talked to great lengths about this and agree that we will be most happy and content with just each other.

But my wife is a firm believer in Buddhist teachings, and she believes that we'd be committing a major sin, akin to murder and she seems to be unable to overcome this to get the courage to make the final decision. And i don't know how to help her get through this. I believe that the decision we want to make will lead to less sufferings, and better for all parties involved. But I fear that if we decide to have an abortion, she will also not be happy and will be in tremendous mental pain and I don't know if she will even be able to heal from it.

We are also super torn due to the fact that other than our own selfish needs and the vision that we have for our life together, there's no other reason to have this abortion. We are happily in love, both our families are well off, incredibly kind, helpful to us and will be over the moon if we reveal to them about the pregnancy. There's no real financial strain to speak of to take care of the baby if we let this happen. In our culture people believe that having children is a blessing, so there's no chance of talking to anyone else in our families about this, because we will face massive judgements that will make it impossible to even speak about an abortion, so that leaves us alone to work this out.

I've tried to convince my wife that this is not a crime, and we are making this decision believing it will be best for our life together, that what ever is inside her right now is not yet a living human being, and if we make this decision with kindness in our hearts, there is no need to fear of guilt, karma or anything like that. But she is dismissing me everytime I mention it and doesnt want or unable to let go of her strong beliefs. I can see that she's in the middle of a crossroads and cannot find a way out that she can accept. She's in great pain, and I'm feeling it too.

Last week on tuesday l went for an ultrasound and they could only see the sac, no yolk or embryo. The doctor said that l can come back 2-3 weeks later. (This was done at a private hospital)

The last few days l got very sick (like a nasty cold) so l went to the urgent care this evening and they did an ultrasound and they could also only see the sac, nothing else. (This was done at the government hospital and the equipment looked a bit older l guess ?)

However, should l be worried? l do have the typical symptons (no vomiting though) and l think my ovultion might have been very late.

When is the best time to go for the next ultrasound? lm scared that if l go too early l will be disappointed again but l also find it difficult to wait for a while.

2025-03-15,1742042496.0,Husband keeps putting his phone on airplane mode,"Im 36 weeks pregnant and I live at home with my husband who has a difficult time sleeping. He often goes to sleep in the guest bedroom down the hall.

I dont mind typically, since I know he struggles with sleeping. However now that Im deep in the third trimester, I need him to be available. And often during the night&he isnt.

2 weeks ago, I had very bad pains for an hour that stopped me from being able to switch sides or even get out of bed. I felt like a beached whale. I tried calling him and texting him, but his phone was on do not disturb and he didnt add me as a person to get through to him when I needed to. After about 20 mins, I was able to get up and crouch my way over to the room down the hall where I angrily woke him up. Bc hes such a disturbed sleeper, he anxiously started yelling what what what! At the top of his lungs at me. I was really upset, bc I felt when I needed him around for our baby, he wasnt there. He was angry for about ten minutes that I woke him up and was grumbling about how I get to nap during the day and he doesnt, but I wasnt having any of it. Respectfully I told him to shut his mouth and do/say nothing unless its about being there for me. Im Puerto Rican and I dont play that . Turns out the baby dropped 2 centimeters!

A couple days later, Im up in the am and hes still sleeping in. My 2 40 pound dogs are on me and Im so big I cant get them off. I try calling him, since I made myself a do not disturb contact and wouldnt you know, he put on his airplane mode! So I couldnt reach him regardless. His excuse was well I went to the other room at 6 am and I figured you were up and youd be fine. Suffice it to say, I was NOT happy. I told him he cant do this, that he needs to be reachable at all times, even if Im just downstairs. 
What if I fall? What if Im in pain again and cant move? What if the dogs wont let me get up? I said if he did it again, there would be big problems.

Now today, same thing. This time, he slept in the other room all night and the dogs are crying to be walked and Im texting/calling him..his phone is off. Im trying to yell for him..but he isnt hearing me. He also planned on waking up this am to go for a quick shake out run since hes running a half marathon tmrw. His mother is landing from Minnesota in a half hour and hes not up. I made it clear that we need to turn over the guest room for her, and need to sweep downstairs. I cleaned pretty much the whole house in prep for her yesterday. Went to Costco to do my final prep run for freezer meal prep for us, so he doesnt lose his mind cooking meals and making a mess bc I wont be able to help much, AND went to his race expo with him to pick up his bib and help him navigate it. Its his first big formal race and Ive ran multiple halfs and a marathon. So wanted to show my support for him.

Why is she coming? Bc he needs to go to a work conference for a week in Utah and the only way Id let him go is if he made sure someone was with me. Bc Im always tired and always need some help.

Am I being a brat or unreasonable to want my husband to not put his need for sleep over making himself available to me in my last month of pregnancy? He is other wise a wonderful husband during the day for the most part. Helps me clean the kitchen after I cook, will do some laundry, help clean the bathroom when I ask, walk the dogs when he can etc. He can be a little selfish from time to time with his day, but who cant? 

Im just getting so annoyed that I have to keep having this convo with him and Im debating telling his mother. Although I dont know what that will do..she tends to coddle him lol. Ive done a lot of work to get him to be less coddled lol. Ive also done a lot of work to get myself to a point where I dont just pop off on him. Being a New Yorker and Latina, thats my instinct. But he doesnt respond well to that and says Im being disrespectful and wont engage with me.

Sorry for the rant everyone. Any advice? Am I being nuts? Thanks!

Update: I popped off on him via text and told him Im telling both of our parents he keeps doing this. He said sorry and that his phone gets put on airplane mode automatically and its just habit. Well it wasnt a habit when he had it on do not disturb and we got into a fight over that right? Now that I can reach him through DND, now its a years long habit lol. I just told him that the fact that he didnt make it a priority to be cognizant of before bed shows how careless and selfish hes being.  I def got tough and rude with him and he told me to stop a few times, which promptly got met with a stfu >7<ý@. Now hes up and trying to check and see if Im ok.

I went from 230lb down to 170lb over a year and a half. It was slow and steady, clean eating and being active. Part of the reason I wanted to lose weight was bc I wanted to be able to see my baby bump sooner after conceiving. I know that sounds dumb but I was so excited with how much progress Id made before conceiving. I thought having the healthy habits already established would help me eat well and stay active during pregnancy. 


Wrong. Im 14 weeks now. At my 10 week appt I had already gained 20lbs. 20 fucking lbs in 10 weeks. Idk where Im at now, Im scared to check. Im huge. My stomach is huge. None of my clothes fit. I cant keep googling weight gain during pregnancy bc all I see is the literature saying youre only supposed to gain 1 - 5 lbs in the first trimester. I see all the articles about how Im hurting my baby by gaining weight too quickly, that Im going to get GD and my baby is going to be too big and Im risking pre term birth or making it more likely that Ill need a c section. Idk how to slow the weight gain down without straight up restricting, and Im terrified to restrict bc I dont want to hurt baby 


I just feel like Ive already failed in so many ways. I feel like I completely tanked my health these last few weeks. Walks are harder for me now, my back hurts even after a 20 min walk. Im trying to do some yoga, I loved doing yoga before getting pregnant.

This pregnancy has been 6 months of constant GI struggles and Im so tired. I was debilitatingly nauseous until about 20 weeks, and Ive also struggled with painful gas and heartburn. I barely slept last night bc of the gastric reflux and the impossible task of finding a comfortable position. Im still eating enough but its gotten to the point where Ive almost developed a fear of food. I dont know if its my organs shifting around or what, but lately things just hurt and burn (or maybe Im just hungry I dont know.) I find myself wondering if food will just make me feel worse, or sometimes its more like apathy, like Im just so tired of needing to eat so often. But then the stomach acid gets worse if I have an empty stomach, sometimes it wakes me up at night and I have to eat a bowl of cereal. I have woken up to myself choking on my own vomit/stomach acid more than once, despite sleeping popped up on pillows. I didnt know whether to label this post as a rant or seeking advice. I feel like the only thing that will help at this point is giving birth. I wish I could fast forward to the end. I try to remind myself at least I dont have other symptoms like sciatica (yet) or GD. I dont know. Im exhausted every day even though I dont really accomplish anything. Doing a load of laundry is a big task these days. I literally do not even remember what it feels like to feel normal, kindof like when youve had a cold for weeks and you cant even remember what it feels like to breathe through your nose (which funnily enough, Ive also had constant rhinitis since October.)

Maybe this is just a rant. I alternate between tums, gasx, Pepcid, etc its like Ive tried everything and it only kindof helps. Maybe Ill ask my OB for a refill of reglan bc it feels like food just sits and rots in me and doesnt move along like its supposed to. Pregnancy is just so sucky and hard and honestly lonely. I dont have any pregnant friends and my mom and MIL and husband are all supportive but its like idk what can anyone say? I hate how my mom hasnt been pregnant in decades and has clearly forgotten (or maybe really never experienced) how truly awful it is. Everyone just wants to celebrate how magical it is and meanwhile I hate this. Im so excited to finally be a mom and have my son, but everything else about this experience is ass. I have a feeling the third trimester is just going to slowly become more and more uncomfortable until I get to the point where I just want to do nothing but lay around like Jabba the Hut until my body decides its going to attempt to expel a whole ass human from my vajayjay. My baby is the reward at the end, but even then its like out of the frying pan and into the fire with birth, breastfeeding, sleeplessness, etc.

Hello everyone!

FTM(31) here, 19 + 6. I had my regular prenatal appointment the other day, and one thing my doctor mentioned really stuck with me. She said its super important to stay active and keep my muscles in shape for the delivery. I didnt think much of it at the time, but now I'm starting to wonder what exactly she meant.

I've been going to the gym religiously (5 days a week for 1.5-2 hours) for the past 2-3 years. But since getting pregnant, I stopped going due to extreme fatigue in the first trimester. 
Now that Im starting to get my energy back, Im really struggling. Im almost always short of breath (just by existing) and cant even last 15 minutes on the stairmaster (level 6) without wheezing. 

I used to love lifting, but I cant even lift half the weight I used to pre-pregnancy. Honestly, even walking around the neighborhood feels exhausting.

What my doctor said really got me thinking and has me a bit worried, to be honest. Im wondering if anyone here can help me understand what she meant by keeping muscles in shape for delivery.

Is she referring to a specific muscle group? Or is it more about cardio? Im just feeling a bit lost on this one.

2025-03-15,1742010191.0,Can I stop eating for baby at 37W?,"TW diet and food 

TLDR because whiney and ranty, sorry : Im due any day now, does my diet still affect the babys development? 

Im normally a healthy eater and love to eat, but pregnancy has been hard on the diet front. Terrible nausea and food aversion during 1st trimester which caused weight loss, somewhat back to normal during 2nd, but the nausea returned by the 3rd along with acid reflux and indigestion, and I never experienced any cravings. Never in my life I thought that eating would become a chore. 

Ive been forcing myself to eat certain things that i particularly dont enjoy for the time being. I normally love flavorful stuff, herbs spices, etc but they all now cause nausea, now I can only have bland stuff. On top of that, Ive been trying to reduce acid and indigestion which means extra boring food, and I just try to eat to meet the minimum recommended macros because Im afraid Ill otherwise cause harm to the baby. To make up for possible lack of nutrients, Im taking so many vitamins and supplements including protein powder, and often thats enough to make me full. All in all, meal times have been stressful. 

Ive now reached 37 weeks and everything is uncomfortable but Im so thankful that things are looking good so far. My weight gain as well as the babys growth is well within the recommended range. At this point, it seems like all the major fStal developments have already happened, and Im far from malnourished. So Im wondering if it would be ok for me to eat more carelessly now for the sake of my own digestive comfort. I feel extremely heavy and exhausted all the time and no amount of calories is helping. It feels like theres no more room left in my body for any food. The baby is very energetic and moves constantly which is both comforting, psychologically and uncomfortable, physically, but I see this as a sign that hes well fed? So can I stop worrying about nutrition at this point? Obviously Im not talking about consuming alcohol and ultra processed trans fat. I just want to eat simple carbs in small amounts and be protein deficient for now until my appetite and digestive system goes back to their pre-pregnancy condition.

I genuinely wish I couldve kept the baby, but Im not married just yet, still with the father who helped me through everything.

Its been really hard for me because I didnt want to tell anyone I was pregnant but people at my work found out and it stressed me out because I couldnt let my family find out and I dont want the news getting back to them. Im a strong baptist but Ive always had more relaxed views of abortion because I understood the need for them to be here.

I went to an incredible clinic out of state that took care of my mental needs while handeling the abortion with such great professionalism and humanity. But its killing me not feeling my baby moving inside me anymore, not being able to hold her.

I didnt even think I could be pregnant. I used to be forced into prostitution and had an eating disorder and other medical conditions that doctors told me it would be impossible for me to get pregnant.

When I finally told the father he was so strong and supportive, helping me through everything. But the weight of everything leaves us numb. I hold my babys prints and blanket and just cry. How long does this pain last?! I know I dont deserve sympathy but it kills me.

My question is because people at work know and have been texting me asking if Im ok, and Ive been ignoring getting back with them because I dont want people knowing about it. But I know when I come back to work people are going to ask and its going to kill me.

What do I say?? Especially in the area I live, abortion especially at the time I had it are extremely frowned upon. And I dont want work to become hostile but they will all know when they see me Im no longer pregnant.

2025-03-15,1742070086.0,"Do Women Have a Moral Duty to Keep Their Bodies ""Ready"" for Reproduction at All Times?","Late last year, Dr. Rebecca Gomperts (Aid Access, Women on Waves) announced results of a large clinical trial in Moldova, testing the use of a weekly low dose of mifepristone (50 mg) as a contraceptive. The results were promising, with only one pregnancy occurring within 2000 cycles. Furthermore, negative side effects were minimal, with only 4% of the participants experiencing any negative side effects (compared to a 40% negative side effect rate for conventional hormonal contraceptives). Additionally, the low-dose mifepristone was easier to use, requiring only one dose a week, and being more ""forgiving"" of variations in the time the pill is taken. And 89% of the study participants reported that they stopped menstruating while taking mifepristone as a contraceptive. (Probably most women would consider this a positive side effect.)

Because of the positive results, the trials have been expanded to the Netherlands this year. If the results continue to be positive, the plan is to apply to the European Medicines Agency for registration and market authorization to allow this weekly, low-dose mifepristone regimen as a contraceptive throughout the EU.

The method of action for mifepristone as birth control is two-fold: it reduces the rate of ovulation and it thins the endometrial lining of the uterus, making it impossible for a fertilized egg to implant.

([Source](https://msmagazine.com/2025/01/07/mifepristone-weekly-contraceptive-clinical-trials-abortion-pill-birth-control/).)

My primary question for PL supporters is this: 

* Would you have any moral or legal objections to women's use of such a contraceptive? If so, on what grounds?

Here are some secondary questions if you believe that the use of this contraceptive would be immoral:

* If a woman was taking mifepristone as described here *as a contraceptive* and informed her partner that she was doing this before they had sex, and if her partner, knowing this, decided to go ahead and have PIV sex with her, and if one of his sperm fertilized an egg but it failed to implant, whose would be the primary responsibility for the ""death"" of the fertilized egg? (Realistically, neither of them would ever know if this happened, so this is a hypothetical question.)
* *Men's* use of tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, red meat, and food high in trans fats during the months before their partners' conception is associated with higher miscarriage rates, because of these substances' impacts on sperm. ([Source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/a-mans-unhealthy-lifestyle-too-can-lead-to-his-partners-pregnancy-loss/articleshow/64072130.cms?from=mdr).)  If men engage in such unhealthy lifestyles, they are not maintaining their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction, and their choices could result in the ""death"" of a fertilized egg or even an embryo or fetus. Do they have a moral duty to maintain their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction by refraining from such lifestyle choices?",Abortiondebate,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jc47ep/do_women_have_a_moral_duty_to_keep_their_bodies/

ER detected no intrauterine pregnancy with an HCG in the 200s. Also detected 3.6cm cyst on left ovary. They diagnosed me with a miscarriage.

Cut to calling the nurse to let her know the diagnosis and schedule a follow up. I had my follow up yesterday on 3/12. They gave me an ultrasound and again, no signs of intrauterine pregnancy. Cyst had shrunk slightly to 3.2cm. They took my blood again and I got the results today.

HCG is now 513. Completely baffled by this, I call the OB and speak with the nurse. She says she suspects that I am still pregnant just very early and thats why nothing is showing on US.

I am so confused. I was pregnant, not pregnant and pregnant again within 6 days. I had already started grieving the loss. Now Im in a state of depressive shock until I know for sure.

I was heartbroken. She told me it could be a few things she said she could have either missed it and that she has missed three peoples babies and another clinic was able to pick them up. This clinic is within my insurance so I know people will say just go to another clinic but I dont have the means at the moment. Or she said it could still be an ectopic pregnancy and she would check hcg hormones and that I might need to go to the er today. It was all really really frighting and I was excited to see my baby today and now she has told me there is nothing on the scan.  Luckily I did not have to go to the er. My hcg levels were 856 and I have an appointment on Monday to see if they are lowering or going up. Im sorry for the long post I am just so racked with fear and worry I just want to know if anyone has any advice or similar situations. I am preparing for the worst and my partner is so optimistic.

2025-03-15,1742009542.0,#Saytheirnames: 18-year-old Alexis Lexi Arguello (USA 2025),"18-year-old Alexis Lexi Arguello had just moved into her own apartment and was preparing to start her adult life when Planned Parenthoods negligence killed her.

Shortly after moving out, Lexi suffered a urinary tract infection, went to get medical treatment and found out that she was pregnant. Likely not sure what her next steps should be, Lexi ended up the Fort Collins Planned Parenthood facility. She was told that she was 20 weeks pregnant. Although the facilitys website claimed that they only did abortions before 20 weeks, they scheduled Lexi for one anyway. 

During the abortion, Lexi suffered life-threatening side effects. It was obvious that she needed emergency medical treatment (which Planned Parenthood did not provide and was in no way equipped for), but the staff delayed in calling an ambulance and let her deteriorate. When they finally did call the ambulance, they tried to conceal the damage done by requesting that the ambulance not use sirens. 

This was not unusual for the facility. Witness reports from protesters and numerous dispatch records documented that the facility's frequent emergencies were  mishandled in a similar way. Life-threatening medical complications were downplayed, and time and time again Planned Parenthood tried to hide what they did to their clients. Ambulances were requested to come without sirens and were frequently directed by staff to use convoluted and indirect routes to make it less obvious that they had yet another emergency. They even had paramedics approach the back instead of using the more accessible main entrance. The ""silent siren treatment"" left Lexi suffering without help for even longer, delaying care and decreasing her chances at survival.

On February 6, the day of the abortion, Lexi's grandparents were told that she was in the emergency room. Her family hadn't even known she was pregnant, and now they arrived to find her in the hospital with doctors desperately struggling to keep her alive. She had lost so much blood that a transfusion of seven liters still didn't improve her condition, and the multiple doses of epinephrine were not enough to keep her heart beating. Her oxygen was too low and despite the best attempts of the ER, her grandparents had *seen in [Lexi's] face that it was her end.* Her blood pressure and heart rate dropped again, and she died the same day as her baby.

Lexi's devastated family wanted to find some semblance of justice for her and will take her killers to court with the help of Pro-Life organization Operation Rescue. A report of what happened to Lexi was also given to the  Colorado Committee of Health and Human Services at a hearing.

The hearing was about a bill that would require abortion facilities in Colorado to follow health and safety regulations in a similar way to medical clinics. Expert witness Dr. Keri Kasun gave testimony on what an unrestricted and unregulated Planned Parenthood had done. She confirmed that Planned Parenthood had delayed Lexis emergency treatment and stated that Lexi had been showing obvious symptoms of an amniotic fluid embolism. The risk of this complication is elevated for abortions later in pregnancy, and Lexi was even further along than she had been told at 22 weeks pregnant. (A premature baby born at this age could survive when given care.)

Amniotic fluid in the bloodstream would impair clotting abilities, making any injuries inflicted on Lexi much more dangerous. The further delays by not treating this as the emergency it was made everything worse.

In response to the bill and to the investigation of their egregious actions, the Public Affairs Manager for Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains (which oversees the oversees Fort Collins chain location) argued that they shouldnt be supervised or regulated and called the corporation a beacon of hope that would ""always fight for their patients"". But as Troy Newman from Operation Rescue put it, **This Planned Parenthood did not care if Lexi Arguello survived her complications. If they had, staff would have called an ambulance the minute she exhibited symptoms, and they would have requested lights, sirens, and any other measures that might have saved Lexis life.**

2025-03-14,1741986159.0,Strange question at Planned Parenthood abortion appointment - Why?,"I took my girlfriend to her appointment and paid for the service for her and was there throughout as she has never done this before and I havent either. At the beginning of the appointment she said she was questioned about support systems, income, family, STD history, etc. and added that they asked her if she had been with more than one person in the last 12 months. She said they dont ask for a number or anything further about it, just if youve been with more than one person. Why would that be included in the questions prior to getting an abortion and what purpose does it serve? Id assume they would ask about your last 1-3 months of sexual activity but why not that and instead asking about 12 months back?

2025-03-15,1742000033.0,22 Week Surgical Abortion Story,"I made a couple posts this week about my upcoming abortion and I was petrified so I wanted to share my story to hopefully calm others. For context I was 22 weeks on the dot and in California for the procedure. I also went to a planned parenthood.
I found out I was pregnant a month and a half before my abortion. I have super irregular periods, had no symptoms, no bump, nothing. When I found out I figured I was not far along and had an at home medical abortion that failed. I bled but my pregnancy test was never negative after that. I then decided to tell my boyfriend and my mom and booked an appointment at pp. My first appointment they ultrasound me and I was 21 weeks. I was in shock and soon after I started to feel him kick. They let me know it would be a two day procedure. I was terrified at first. I have extremely bad medical ptsd and am beyond terrified of doctors and needles. I did not sleep at all that week, but soon the fear of needles subsided and I was just sad. I spent a week feeling him kick. I felt like a mother and was so attached. I was two weeks away from the cut off in California and I made my choice for several reasons. Since I was unknowingly pregnant I was drinking for months and months while pregnant. I am also an avid vaper. On top of that I had the medical abortion. I could not live with myself if I brought a child into this world with chronic health issues, as that was what happened to me. I was put up for adoption and had chronic medical issues and hence the medical trauma. I felt I did not have enough time to check for health issues and I did not feel comfortable bringing a child into a world where I am not financially stable. I want to give my child the world and right now I was not capable of that. Me and my partner were adopted and know what the other side of that looks like so that could never be an option for us. I was overcome with grief but I knew what the right choice was, no matter how hard it was and still is. The first day of the procedure was the scariest for me. This was when they did the fetal injection to end the heart beat and did the dilation sticks. I was sick to my stomach over that shot, but I voiced that to my doctor and she could not have handled me better. She talked to me about my life the whole way through the procedure. The injection did not hurt, it was uncomfortable because I could feel how deep the needle was. The dilation sticks also did not hurt as she numbed me. The numbing shot was probably the most uncomfortable of them all but bearable. The next day I went in for the procedure and they knocked me out stone cold. I worked myself up for a lot of nothing. Medically it was not a hard procedure, emotionally it was. For anyone considering only you know the right decision for yourself.

I cannot express how thankful I am. If I had enough money, I would pay for planned parenthood to stay open and thriving eternally.

2025-03-14,1741991016.0,"My husband wants more kids, are my conditions unreasonable?","When I met my husband I was a fence sitter. Over time I warmed up the idea and decided Id be okay with one baby. Husband wanted three, but was glad I was open to one. We got married and after a year of trying I got pregnant with my little girl who is due in June.

Now tell me why this man is watching me suffer and is already talking about a second baby??
We had discussed right before I got pregnant that I MIGHT do two, but we dont know what pregnancy and parenthood will be like and Im not rushing to make that decision before we see what life is like with a baby.

He keeps saying the baby needs a sibling and he really wants a boy and a girl. I thought on it and decided under certain conditions I could be open to one more, definitely not three.

My conditions: 
1. We must be comfortable with the political and economical climate at the time specifically in regard to womens rights and maternal rights.

2. After breast feeding husband pays for a breast lift and tummy tuck if needed.

3. He must be okay with stopping at 2 even if we have another daughter. By stopping at 2 I mean he will get a vasectomy.

Husband is willing to accept 1-2 and says even if its another girl hed gladly stop at 2 babies so she can have a sibling. 

However, he says he will not get a vasectomy. I explained in detail how its reversible and much safer than me getting my tubes tied. He insists we can continue to use condoms and plan B as needed. I told him currently in the USA they are working to ban birth control, abortion, and plan b and we will have no fall back if I get pregnant at 40 which we both agree we wouldnt want another kid at that age.

Is this unreasonable? He says he doesnt want to mess with his downstairs and I rolled my eyes and reminded him what Im doing to my body for us to have a child.

My husband has been kind and taken good care of me through this, but I feel Ive compromised a lot and met him half way on our ideals with what our family will be like. Is a vasectomy really asking too much??

Edit: Id like to point out as there seems to be some confusion. Id never force my husband to have a vasectomy. Its simply a condition if he wants a second child which is something he wants.

I didnt even think I could be pregnant. I used to be forced into prostitution and had an eating disorder and other medical conditions that doctors told me it would be impossible for me to get pregnant.

I am not 100% sure of how far along I am. My last period was last December 19. I took a PT by the end of January and it was negative.

So, if you count it based on my last menstruation, it would be around 11 weeks already. But, if I became pregnant in February, it's been only a few weeks. Therefore, it is possible that I won't recognize the fetus, right? =-

I am fully recovered physically but mentally and emotionally disoriented. My person was somewhat supportive throughout the process but not exactly how I wanted him to be. He was going out a lot and speaking with other females. Me and him arent fully in a relationship but I wouldve appreciated him investing his time into me during these times. Recently he has been doing things that have been getting on my nerves. He would always plan to see me but cancel on the very last minute. He did this a good 3 times. He would reach out to me and call me to hang out but once I get ready he would flake. I feel like he was doing it on purpose and I called him out on his behaviour and decided to delete him and move on because I dont deal with men like that. He would constantly message/call apologising and would make more plans. I would forgive him naturally because of the soft spot I had for him during the pregnancy. If it wasnt for that, I wouldve disappeared. Just recently Ive seen him partying through other peoples instagram/snapchat stories and I thought it would be funny blowing up his phone. He took this to heart and told me can you stop being so clingy, I came out of a 5 year relationship she was clingy and I dont like it. I fuck with you but stop. He called me clingy in the past to but I never too it as offensive. This hurt my feelings because he said it out of anger.  I was just doing it to be annoying and he took it for a complete different meaning. It wasnt the best idea. I think he thinks I want a relationship with him because of natural loving nature. I am affection and loving to people and love to give. My plan during our time together wasnt to fall in love. However, with the excessive love bombing, he would say things like im falling in love, or when you become my mrs he would talk about marriage a lot in the beginning. Kinda scared me because I know what he was trying to do. I wanted to keep things causal but since I got pregnant I grew an attachment with him as any woman wouldve. He makes me feel bad for it and when I try to express my emotions he shuts down. Theres been loads of times he has annoyed me but I forgave him and moved on. In this case, I deleted him from social media out of hurt and few days later I tried to message on iMessage and hes giving me the silent treatment. Bear in mind we were together a week before the argument, having sex. He hasnt blocked me from iMessage but when I try to request him he ignores the request. When I did this in the past he said you can stay there and learn your lesson. When I was pregnant with him. Im not sure exactly what to do now, I want to leave one last message before I fully move on as I feel like one day sooner or later. Hes going to try to reconnect and Im going to feel emotionally disoriented again. I want to take this time to heal and fully move on without being disturbed.

Whats really hard to understand is that youre getting angry because I felt attached. Any woman in my position would have felt that way. And to make me feel bad about it, especially after everything Ive been through physically, emotionally, and mentally, feels inconsiderate. I dont understand why this is such a sensitive topic for you when Ive gone through it. This isnt me trying to argue with you but choosing to communicate better. You can continue with the silent treatment if you want, but just know that you wont hear from me again. 

I found out I was pregnant beginning of this year and had my abortion a week after finding out. I felt so de attached and empty for the first week then went through a few week where I was so depressed, lost, regretful. Looking back I should have asked for help or spoken about my feeling more with my close ones. 

 Anyways, I thankfully managed to get back to normal weeks after and I kind of stopped thinking about my abortion and baby. Fast forward to now, for the past few days all I think about is my very short pregnancy, my baby and I now again feel a need to have a baby. I really thought I have recovered and moved on but maybe I havent? All I see now is babies and pregnant women. I cant stop thinking and day dreaming about pregnancy and being a mother. 

Has anyone got any advice? To clarify dates I had my abortion in January and my depressive stage lasted about 3 weeks. I was really hoping to be completely okay with it months after. I think I am scared that I could potentially go back to being in such a dark place. I look back and its super scary how unaware I was of how sad I truly was. Everyone around me would ask and try to help but I didnt accept it. I wouldnt clean, would just daydream 24/7, shower very little, not say much for weeks so it was very bad. 

How can I make sure I do not go back to that? ",abortion,7.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jbutnu/feelings_coming_back/
2025-03-15,1742052802.0,Im terrified. I need help finding funding if possible. USA/PA/MD border kinda.,"Ive been searching for answers for weeks and weeks and the farther along I get, the more terrified I get. I have no friends. I have no family that cares about me. And I just feel like no matter where or who I turn to Im going to get judgement. About everything. I dont have my children at this time (I just got out of rehab and a recovery house a few months ago so still working on getting them back in my full care,) and that makes me feel even worse about getting pregnant. My boyfriend and I took a break, we were fighting A LOT, it was an almost three month break (up), and I stupidly got pregnant because the condom got stuck inside of me. Ive been trying to find funding for an abortion for weeks. I even went to a clinic that said they offered support which I misunderstood completely and I told them I didnt want to see anything. They end up doing an ultrasound, they had the audio on so I heard the heartbeat, and then they printed a photo for me to keep. They then at the end of the appointment told me they dont have the resources to help with abortion. Only prenatal, postpartum and adoption services. And then they kept me there for 30 mins telling me why I should follow through. So for two weeks it ate at me and ate at me.. but, I dont want to follow through. I want to get my own babies back first. They deserve so much better than what Ive given them in their lives. I called the national abortion fund and they told me as a head of household for one which Id technically be with me as a server making $2.33/hr and then $450/week I could not qualify for assistance. I dont see any of my hourly wages it gets garnished directly to child support for my children. So the $450 (if I make that) I have to pay the rest of my CS and get to and from work (i uber mostly as I dont have my own vehicle) I dont know where else to look. I dont want to do a Medication Abortion all alone especially not at 10 weeks+. I feel as if it will be traumatizing and it will make my mental health even worse than it already is and I do not want to relapse either because pain is a big trigger for me, so I would really like to just figure out how I can do it safely, with a professional, who can help manage my pain safely. I just cant justify keeping this baby with the factor of me being a year clean only; not having my kids, not having a car, like theres so many factors. I tried to keep this as short as possible. Im sorry. Does anyone have any other resources that might be able to help me? I filled out a form for a place about 30 mins away from me that does them with Local anesthesia.

2025-03-15,1742030442.0,We both want abortion but my wife can't get over the fears from her beliefs. How can i help her?,"Hi guys,

I seriously need your help on this, and this is a long one.

We just got married, and we f'd up. We know this is our mistake and we are blaming ourselves for letting this happen.

My wife and I just found out she's pregnant a few days ago, just a month after our wedding. The scan we did yesterday didn't even show the embryo inside the uterus, so we still have time to decide what to do. It's very early. It's too early even to do a MA. Now our initial reaction and up to even now after a few days is that we are not ready to have kids. We still want to enjoy our lives and no matter how we go through the scenarios in our head and together, we can not imagine and cannot accept the reality that there will be a children in our life, at least at this time. We fully believe having a kid will more likely leave us with more suffering, and unhappiness. We've talked to great lengths about this and agree that we will be most happy and content with just each other.

But my wife is a firm believer in Buddhist teachings, and she believes that we'd be committing a major sin, akin to murder and she seems to be unable to overcome this to get the courage to make the final decision. And i don't know how to help her get through this. I believe that the decision we want to make will lead to less sufferings, and better for all parties involved. But I fear that if we decide to have an abortion, she will also not be happy and will be in tremendous mental pain and I don't know if she will even be able to heal from it.

We are also super torn due to the fact that other than our own selfish needs and the vision that we have for our life together, there's no other reason to have this abortion. We are happily in love, both our families are well off, incredibly kind, helpful to us and will be over the moon if we reveal to them about the pregnancy. There's no real financial strain to speak of to take care of the baby if we let this happen. In our culture people believe that having children is a blessing, so there's no chance of talking to anyone else in our families about this, because we will face massive judgements that will make it impossible to even speak about an abortion, so that leaves us alone to work this out.

I've tried to convince my wife that this is not a crime, and we are making this decision believing it will be best for our life together, that what ever is inside her right now is not yet a living human being, and if we make this decision with kindness in our hearts, there is no need to fear of guilt, karma or anything like that. But she is dismissing me everytime I mention it and doesnt want or unable to let go of her strong beliefs. I can see that she's in the middle of a crossroads and cannot find a way out that she can accept. She's in great pain, and I'm feeling it too.

2025-03-15,1742000033.0,22 Week Surgical Abortion Story,"I made a couple posts this week about my upcoming abortion and I was petrified so I wanted to share my story to hopefully calm others. For context I was 22 weeks on the dot and in California for the procedure. I also went to a planned parenthood.
I found out I was pregnant a month and a half before my abortion. I have super irregular periods, had no symptoms, no bump, nothing. When I found out I figured I was not far along and had an at home medical abortion that failed. I bled but my pregnancy test was never negative after that. I then decided to tell my boyfriend and my mom and booked an appointment at pp. My first appointment they ultrasound me and I was 21 weeks. I was in shock and soon after I started to feel him kick. They let me know it would be a two day procedure. I was terrified at first. I have extremely bad medical ptsd and am beyond terrified of doctors and needles. I did not sleep at all that week, but soon the fear of needles subsided and I was just sad. I spent a week feeling him kick. I felt like a mother and was so attached. I was two weeks away from the cut off in California and I made my choice for several reasons. Since I was unknowingly pregnant I was drinking for months and months while pregnant. I am also an avid vaper. On top of that I had the medical abortion. I could not live with myself if I brought a child into this world with chronic health issues, as that was what happened to me. I was put up for adoption and had chronic medical issues and hence the medical trauma. I felt I did not have enough time to check for health issues and I did not feel comfortable bringing a child into a world where I am not financially stable. I want to give my child the world and right now I was not capable of that. Me and my partner were adopted and know what the other side of that looks like so that could never be an option for us. I was overcome with grief but I knew what the right choice was, no matter how hard it was and still is. The first day of the procedure was the scariest for me. This was when they did the fetal injection to end the heart beat and did the dilation sticks. I was sick to my stomach over that shot, but I voiced that to my doctor and she could not have handled me better. She talked to me about my life the whole way through the procedure. The injection did not hurt, it was uncomfortable because I could feel how deep the needle was. The dilation sticks also did not hurt as she numbed me. The numbing shot was probably the most uncomfortable of them all but bearable. The next day I went in for the procedure and they knocked me out stone cold. I worked myself up for a lot of nothing. Medically it was not a hard procedure, emotionally it was. For anyone considering only you know the right decision for yourself.

2025-03-15,1742027301.0,Nervous! Question (and ramble) regarding GP,"So Im currently 7 weeks pregnant, if my workings out are correct.
Ive decided on an abortion as my partner and I just arent ready at this time - were looking for a bigger house as we are in a tiny house with no space for anything and we are trying to improve our quality of life.
I am an anxious person and I understand that having a baby is going to be stressful and an anxious time, and If we are going to do it at some point, I want to remove as much of that anxiety as possible. I feel having a bigger house and being in a space where we can do it at least removes some of that anxiety. I genuinely cannot see us with a baby in this space currently. 
I did come off the pill about a year ago as I didnt want to be on it anymore and at that point we sort of said just see what happens, but have been careful and used condoms where we could. Since then my anxiety/OCD has gotten worse and now its actually happened I just cant go through with it, for our sake and a childs sake.
I did go to my GP last week as I had some bleeding and cramps (which he said were normal) and the pregnancy was confirmed there and documented on my record.
I told him I was no longer on the pill and he asked me if I was keeping the pregnancy. I panicked and said yes as I was scared hed judge me when Id just said I came off the pill.
Now I have my consultation next week and Im worried that when the GP surgery finds out Ive had a termination that I will get in trouble.
I know you dont have to tell your doctor but as its on my record that Im pregnant, I dont want to turn up at a next appointment (whenever that may be) and they think Im still pregnant.

2025-03-15,1742062747.0,Confused on logic and rights,"I recently did a deep dive and it left me confused. My issue is that I still don't have a genuine grasp on the logistics behind PL. I understand that PL views every fetus as a full-blown person with rights. However, rights come with the clause of not being able to take away someone else's rights no matter how small they seem in comparison. This should extend to the fetus if they are a full-blown human. That is where my logic leads me. Even if we take away the status of human with rights leaving them with just human life, the PP can still use their bodily autonomy to remove it. 


Furthermore, it's not the fetuses fighting against abortion it is born people. It's people with peens and uterus. By taking away one uterus owner's bodily autonomy you take away all bodily autonomy for current and future uterus owners. That is what having equal rights is about no matter how big or small the person is their rights are equal. If you give yourself the right to decide on someone else's behalf the same can be said in reverse. You cause a car accident and you're the perfect match for the person who got hurt you can and will be forced to save them. I understand being morally against something but you can't turn it into legislation that takes away rights from people currently alive and future generations. Jehovah's Witnesses don't believe in blood transfusions but they don't turn it into legislation because not everyone believes what they do and they would be taking away people's RTL. This is where my logic leads.  


In contrast, the PC logic seems streamlined to me. You have the right to bodily autonomy meaning you control what happens to or inside your body. If you end up pregnant and don't want to be you have the right to end that pregnancy. You end up pregnant and you want it congratulations hope you enjoy the journey. When applying the fetus has rights, not much changes. You end up pregnant and don't want to be, it's in your body and it can't take away your right to keep itself alive nor can any born person. You end up pregnant and you want it congrats on the pregnancy. It's beginning to feel more and more like your rights matter as long as there isn't a fetus involved.

About a week ago, one of the deacons began to heavily push me about having our marriage convalidated before the Easter vigil (my wife is a cradle catholic just fyi). I told him that it would likely not happen as my wife is 37 weeks pregnant and we just have a ton of stuff going on in our life. We planned on doing the marriage convalidation anyways once I became a full catholic.  I have been called several times by several of our deacons and have made my position clear several times. This is now what has led to a scheduled face to face between our pastor and my wife and I.

I have a feeling they are going to say I cant continue forward unless I get my marriage convalidated and I feel that is not right. I cant find anything that requires that a Candidate must have their marriage convalidated in order to take the other Sacraments.

I feel strong in my position to wait and will likely not be strong armed into doing so (I chose Saint Thomas More as my intercessor a few weeks ago which seems fitting now).

Cut to calling the nurse to let her know the diagnosis and schedule a follow up. I had my follow up yesterday on 3/12. They gave me an ultrasound and again, no signs of intrauterine pregnancy. Cyst had shrunk slightly to 3.2cm. They took my blood again and I got the results today.

HCG is now 513. Completely baffled by this, I call the OB and speak with the nurse. She says she suspects that I am still pregnant just very early and thats why nothing is showing on US.

I am so confused. I was pregnant, not pregnant and pregnant again within 6 days. I had already started grieving the loss. Now Im in a state of depressive shock until I know for sure. They scheduled me for another US on 3/31. I cant wait that long. I need to know. Something doesnt feel right. I have symptoms, breast tenderness, heartburn when lying down. But there is this emptiness in my uterus but also feels tight with little bubbles. Almost exactly the feeling right before a period floods. I started spotting again today, but this time it was bright red on the tp only when I wiped. Now back to brown again. Please give me any experiences or thoughts.

Would they work instead of maternity shirts which look like tents?","Just for extra clarification, I'm thinking of going not only a size up in work shirt, but it is a shirt that is specifically 'oversized' (as opposed to 'fitted' or 'normal').

I have already read several posts in this subreddit about going a size up in clothing not really being suitable, but nothing really talks about the 'oversize' style.

I am asking because I have seen pregnancy work shirts and they either look great, but are hyper expensive and I'll only wear them for a few weeks at the end of the pregnancy, or they're more inexpensive but look terrible, like  big drapey tents.

I read this is more normal later in the pregnancy, but Ive had it for the last week and a half and I am going crazy not being able to breathe. I have tried everything (humidifier, nasal strips, nasal spray when I didnt know, saline spray after I read more, hot compress, elevated sleeping).

It has really made me worry a lot. I feel so terrible for her she has 4 children already but has had a few miscarriages before, she is dealing with it really well considering, bless her soul. Its just made me concerned for the wellbeing of this baby, I have an appointment on Wednesday with the GP but will not have a scan until a few weeks from now. I am constantly nauseous I mean 24/7 if Im not nauseous I am asleep. I feel genuinely exhausted all day I can barely get up, my whole back hurts constantly. It feels truly debilitating, on top of that I am getting heart palpitations throughout the day, I really cant stand throwing up so I try hold it in but sometimes I cant, every smell makes me feel sick and I feel like I have super senses now and can smell every single particle in the air.  My partner is really supportive but he just doesnt have the perspective and I feel like Im being naggy and complaining constantly but its how I feel all the time.

I have recently lost my mother too who was like the pregnancy guru she had 6 daughters and 20 grandchildren and was present for almost every birth. I havent mentioned my pregnancy to my sisters because I found out so close to my sister miscarrying I dont want to bring it up for at least a few weeks

2025-03-15,1742060312.0,AITA for not wanting anyone besides my medical team/midwife in the delivery room?,"Planning to have a natural/unmedicated birth of my first child, and ideally just want to deliver with my medical team.

I work in the medical field myself, and have attended a handful of births during my training,

I dont feel the need to have my mother/family/in-laws physically present in the room as I push, even if they are adamant about this.

Furthermore, my husband is fantastic, wonderful, and supportive - but he is also the person who will 100% pass out at the first sight of blood (flashback to me picking him up off the floor after our dog cut their foot with moderate bleeding&.)

For this very short window of time where I want to be in the proper mindset and in the zone to do this without medication, I simply dont want to have to worry about any family members in the room, or my husband striking his head on the floor *when* he inevitably passes out at the first side of blood. For this short period of time, Im really not interested in the stop and chat or social visits while I am in pain and trying to get through this, before or during delivery.


For some background, I have a wonderful relationship with my family/ in-laws and they will be very involved in our childs life, but I was raised very strictly religious and incredibly modest, so it seems odd for people who have constantly checked me for modesty my whole life and not wanted to even see my calves,
Suddenly feel the need to be present to watch me stretch my perineum and take a bloody bowel movement &..

I am incredibly shy, modest, and introverted. I am a grown adult of decent fitness and literally feel uncomfortable wearing shorts in public, so no Im not excited to have an audience for this, husband included. 

Of course I dont want him to miss any part of his childs life, but I also dont want him to get hurt *when* he passes out and I dont want to feel like I am the one constantly looking over to make sure he is ok during this time. We have talked about it and he would like to be there but is also realizing he probably wont do well. Maybe for our next child, I myself dont know what to expect and want to do this my way, but will have my midwife present as my advocate.

I was joking that my ideal fantasy is to get to the hospital too early, they say its going to be a long time until delivery, so I tell my husband to go home and get some sleep or go to work for part of the day instead of sitting around, I pop this baby out and tell him to come back to meet his son when its all over lol

I feel that this is an intimate, intense, short period of life that I would like to have what little control over it that I can.

Just looking for anyone else who has felt this way or decided to deliver this way. 



TLDR; 
Want to deliver on my own in the hospital without an audience.

Any tips for setting boundaries for the delivery room?

Our families will be very involved and everyone is excited to welcome them,

My boyfriend and I have a 1-year-old daughter, we have been living together in his parents' house since she was 13 days old, as we are STILL unable to move to a place we can call OURS for now, but in the meantime we both work, me as a freelancer in about 3 restaurants from Thursday to Sunday, and him as a logistics assistant, currently taking a forklift operator course to move up.

Context given and probably questions answered, let's go 
Me and my mother-in-law got along well in the beginning, nowadays we don't anymore 
A few days ago I was at my mother's house, my boyfriend was organizing the room and said ""my mother is washing some of Serena's clothes that came from her mother's friend because she said some of them already fit"" so I said ok, right? But I had seen every outfit in that bag and they were all still huge for her, but if she says so... 

Well, these days I was noticing that her wardrobe, which used to be full (even full of clothes that fit her), is now EMPTY 
Guys, I leave some clothes at my mother's house, and obviously clothes there until we lived there, it's always been like that and even then there was never as much of a shortage at my mother's house as here, I barely took my daughter's clothes when I went down and I didn't have to bring any from here because both houses didn't lack clothes for her, because since she was born, what she gets the most is clothes 

It turns out that after a while, I noticed her wardrobe was more empty, like a total of almost NOTHING, REALLY NOTHING, and then yesterday I remembered that he had said that to me, and then I asked ""do you remember that you said that your mother washed some of Serena's clothes?. ask her where she is, the wardrobe has nothing""

Then he didn't want to ask right away, I was impatient and asked him straight away, ""Filipe said you had washed some of Serena's clothes because you thought they would fit, where are they?"" 
Then she said ""Serena's clothes she WON and I bought them, I washed them and kept them in a place you won't know where because these are just """"""MINE"""" and hers, you keep taking her clothes downstairs and they never come back here ""yes, I take some to keep down there, but that's because UNTIL THEN THERE HAD NEVER BEEN MISSING HERE TOO and that thing about her ""she lives here, not there""

And I really noticed, many times when she gave serena a bath, the clothes she wore on my daughter, most of the time I NEVER EVEN SEE THEM, so like
Currently I'm creating the theory that she has a pair of my girl's clothes, she knows that her wardrobe is empty, even with her clothes stored SHE DOESN'T PUT THEM IN THE WARDROBE 

She literally keeps clothes that my daughter gets and the ones she buys just for her and I will probably never even know the quantity 
Sometimes it's not even ""missing"" it's just clothes that never went into her wardrobe

2025-03-15,1742010191.0,Can I stop eating for baby at 37W?,"TW diet and food 

TLDR because whiney and ranty, sorry : Im due any day now, does my diet still affect the babys development? 

Im normally a healthy eater and love to eat, but pregnancy has been hard on the diet front. Terrible nausea and food aversion during 1st trimester which caused weight loss, somewhat back to normal during 2nd, but the nausea returned by the 3rd along with acid reflux and indigestion, and I never experienced any cravings. Never in my life I thought that eating would become a chore. 

Ive been forcing myself to eat certain things that i particularly dont enjoy for the time being. I normally love flavorful stuff, herbs spices, etc but they all now cause nausea, now I can only have bland stuff. On top of that, Ive been trying to reduce acid and indigestion which means extra boring food, and I just try to eat to meet the minimum recommended macros because Im afraid Ill otherwise cause harm to the baby. To make up for possible lack of nutrients, Im taking so many vitamins and supplements including protein powder, and often thats enough to make me full. All in all, meal times have been stressful. 

Ive now reached 37 weeks and everything is uncomfortable but Im so thankful that things are looking good so far. My weight gain as well as the babys growth is well within the recommended range. At this point, it seems like all the major fStal developments have already happened, and Im far from malnourished. So Im wondering if it would be ok for me to eat more carelessly now for the sake of my own digestive comfort. I feel extremely heavy and exhausted all the time and no amount of calories is helping. It feels like theres no more room left in my body for any food. The baby is very energetic and moves constantly which is both comforting, psychologically and uncomfortable, physically, but I see this as a sign that hes well fed? So can I stop worrying about nutrition at this point? Obviously Im not talking about consuming alcohol and ultra processed trans fat. I just want to eat simple carbs in small amounts and be protein deficient for now until my appetite and digestive system goes back to their pre-pregnancy condition.

Hi everyone,  

This is my first post, and I really need some opinions and support. In my community, theres a lot of stigma around elective C-sections, and its making me feel even more anxious about my decision.  

I am 32 years old from India currently living in Australia. Im currently 37 weeks pregnant with gestational diabetes but no other complications. I have a strong fear of vaginal delivery and have been leaning towards an elective C-section. My husband was initially supportive, but after our last appointment, where the doctor discussed the risks, he became a bit hesitant and asked me to rethink it. However, he reassured me that he would support my final decision.  

I also have my mom coming to help for three months postpartum, so I know Ill have support during recovery. Despite that, I cant shake the guilt and pressure from the stigma surrounding elective C-sections.  

Id love to hear from others whove been in a similar situation. How did you handle the decision? How was your recovery? And if youve faced judgment for choosing a C-section, how did you deal with it?

I recently found out I was pregnant. I am almost 11 weeks along. He has one child of his own, and that child is a handful. The mother is not involved and he has no family to help him.. lately all its been is him smoking weed all day and just laying on the couch. I have been extremely depressed and have no motivation for anything and I have been very sick. When I first told him I was pregnant (this was a surprise as I was on birth control), he right off the bat told me to get an abortion.. which is upsetting because he always used to tell me he doesnt believe in it.  Until eventually he changed his mind when he brought up he can go work somewhere far when the baby is born to make money. Which seems odd.. but oh well. Anyways.. skip to today, I can not be with this man. His child is a handful, all four of mine are easier to handle for a full day than his kid in an hour.

2025-03-15,1742013555.0,22(f) just found out Im pregnant after bf cheated,"I (22f) just found out my Christian boyfriend was cheating on me WITH TINDER GIRLS for about a month. As far as I know it was emotional cheating only but probably lots of sexting, etc. Anyways I broke up with him immediately after and that was two weeks ago. For more context, I went off the pill in July and have been extremely irregular since then, so I thought I was likely infertile until my cycle went pack to normal. Regardless, we had been extremely careful. We used condoms every single time except LITERALLY ONCE. This was back in December. I took a pregnancy test today because I have been abnormally bloated recently and thought I should to be safe. It was positive. I have had basically no other symptoms which is wild because I now am at around 3.5 months. Obviously I am freaking out. I have always been pro choice but anti abortion if that makes sense. However I am not in a situation (life or financial) where I am ready to be a single parent, and I believe that is what would happen if I went through with this. It is crazy to me that some people try for years that want a baby and some people get pregnant by a one time fluke. Life is cruel sometimes. Anyways, any words of wisdom  or encouragement would be appreciated. This is a very scary situation.

We were told at our first growth scan last thrusday that I am still in the normal levels but my amniotic fluid is mildly increasing (Polyhydramnios). My baby is/was currently in the vertex position and is moving around just fine however with the increase of fluid i worry he will flip again. My placenta is also fine according to the scan. babies' heartbeat is also fine. According to our OB baby is weighting at 4.4lbs which is big for 30wks. My patient chart states that baby is measuring at 33wks instead of 30wks which my OB did not address with me but did question if me or my husband were big babies. We were 7lb and 8lbs at birth. She told me to come back in 2wks for a follow up and then in 4wks for another growth scan. 

To sum everything up, what are your experiences with polyhydramnios? Should I be concerned? Is there anything I can do? Is it normal for baby to be so big at this stage, or did we just get my estimated delivery date wrong?

Apparently, it's PUPPP, which I didn't even know existed!! I hit most of the markers for it: FTM, Huge baby, Male baby, and rapid weight gain. My doctor confirmed it was PUPPP this past Wednesday and shared his sympathies. He told me all I can really do is take an aveeno oat bath and take benadryl in moderation.

I spend so much of my energy trying not to rip my stomach apart scratching.
I've tried a lot. Sarna, benadryl, calamine lotion, witchhazel, oat baths, tar soap, cold compresses. 
So far the only thing that works is taking an aveeno oatmeal bath in lukewarm/cold water, using fragrance free cerave moisturizer, cold compresses, and not wearing clothes or getting hot. It's not a 100% change. I still itch after a bit, but it isn't usually the unbearable itching.

I did some fertility treatment: letrozole, Trigger shot and Timed intercourse and was successful the first cycle. I had an ultrasound yesterday at my fertility clinic and was told I am 6 weeks along they saw my yolk sac and baby and they heard a strong heartbeat. 

They referred me back to my family doctor based on the success. I had an ultrasound today at a diagnostic centre for my family doctor and they said I am 5 weeks along and they saw only a yolk sac but no baby.

What could be the reason for this discrepancy. I was given a potential due date yesterday at the fertility clinic as well so this is all quite confusing. Trying not to panic but any insight would be great.

We made the mistake of telling family our name idea for our son (due in July). No one likes the name and a few of my family members have sort of ruined the name for me - they think it's ""old fashioned"" and ""stupid"" and my mum has even said it reminds her of a celebrity with the same name who is a major asshole which further ruined the name for me!. I spoke with my partner about this and we spent a while looking at other name ideas. We kept disagreeing on every name that we found, but we did eventually find one that we both like. The issue is my partner still prefers the original name we had chosen and thinks it's special because we've been calling him that name the whole time.

2025-03-15,1742034035.0,"I want to improve relationship with my mom, but I cant stand her","Im 26 weeks pregnant and my mom insists on staying at my house during postpartum to take care of me, but she hasnt cared much for me during pregnancy and I seriously cannot stand her, even though I love her very much.

Until now, she has come to visit me once, never texted or asked me about my conditions, said she would visit us but cancelled last minute twice. 

Today is my parents wedding anniversary, she told us to come for dinner but I said we would come over for lunch because I have other things. I came and she said she didnt know I would not be staying for dinner. I told her I had work that I cant miss, Ive been very stressed out about work that I woke up at 2am and cant fall back to sleep for several nights already. I was exhausted, the house was small there is no room for me to rest, so while my parents took afternoon nap in their room, I had to lay on the floor in the living room. I ended up leaving around 3pm because I didnt want to torture myself.

My husband and I are very private person, we dont like having other people in our house so we purposefully only built two rooms, one for home office and the other our bedroom. When my mom told me she would come over to stay, I told her we didnt have a room, and she said why built such a badly designed house. She wanted me to do postpartum confinement for at least 2 weeks without touching water (meaning no shower), and I said no. The argue only ended with my dads intervention telling my mom her way was very old-fashioned and not suitable anymore. I told her Ill let her know if I needed help, but Im not making any arrangements for now.

The thing is, I know my mom cares and her love language is food, but she talks too loudly and too much, and her obsession with food drives me nuts. Whenever I talked to her about other things, she brushed them off. I had so much childhood trauma with my mom I cant bring myself to be open with her anymore.

When I was a kid, I told my mom my hair was falling out but she didnt care until I was almost bald. She laughed at my handmade gift to her and told me it was ugly. In uni I asked her to bring home (southeast asia) some pottery and glass I made and treasured very much, she left them at my cousins house in the US. When I asked to move out because I didnt feel comfortable living together, she threatened to cut ties because she was afraid of what others might say. She never said sorry to me once. Honestly, I dont think my feelings matter much to her. Shes controlling, and loves my brother because he would listen to her demands all the time. I have stopped telling her anything going on with me because she would brush them off, telling me we earn a lot of money so those are not really problems.

Im afraid my relationship with my mom will affect the relationship with my child, and I really want to have a loving, open relationship with my mom. I know its two-way, Im also part of the problem as Im too independent and like spending time alone. I feel more at ease to be with my cats than with my mom because I dont have to talk or entertain them. I know my mom will be a great help once baby comes, but I cant bring myself to ask her anything. Im afraid Id be too annoyed at her and make myself even more tired.

Unplanned pregnancy so I have had no time to research into or preparation when it comes to morning sickness.

My morning sickness changes daily with what sets me off and I am unsure if this is unusually but the only thing I can consistantly keep down are dairy products. I usually feel sick in the stomach from when I wake up to 12pm and from 4:30/5pm until I sleep which can be countered with some snacking I have noticed. I haven't been throwing up much, but I haven't been able to eat much in one sitting and constantly feel like I am starving. I've been taking vitamins to help and they have greatly reduced the sickness in the mornings, but I am still constantly hungry. I am considering getting nuts and dried fruits to snack on throughout the day. Is this a sign that I am not getting enough nutrition at the moment?

2025-03-15,1742007283.0,35 weeks. Need advice. What do I do after a non-fault car accident leaves our family with no income?,"Hello. I am located in SC, United States. Throwaway due to us still being in legal proceedings with the Car accident. I am currently 35 weeks pregnant with our first, and I am high risk. My husband got into a car crash last week that has left him with a broken leg in two spots. The car was totaled, and the other party was cited as 100% at fault. We have no idea how he is alive but I am unbelievably amazed that he is. His recovery is looking like 4-6 weeks, with no surgery. This will be confirmed at various follow ups so unfortunately until he heals, I do not have an exact timeframe. I am grateful that this does not currently look like a long term injury.

We have done the correct things regarding the accident, such as reaching out to our insurance, the other driver's insurance, and a family friend's recommended personal injury lawyer. I am following the advice of my lawyer regarding the car accident, but I am looking for advice regarding how to pay our bills in the meantime. Due to the nature of his injury, this is looking like it will be a relatively long settlement period while he recovers. We expect a reasonable amount at the end of this.

At this time, we have one remaining vehicle that is paid off and are not worried about getting a second anytime soon. The car involved in the accident was in my father's name and he will be receiving the car settlement, not us. The injury settlement will be what I am going to receive at the end of this. We live paycheck to paycheck and due to my high risk pregnancy, I am currently off work. Prior to the accident, at the end of our bills we have $80 for gas, and my father/WIC are covering our groceries. My husband barely makes just enough for us not to be eligible for food stamps. I do not have any disability pay or paid maternity leave. My husband just started a new job two months ago and is not eligible for disability or paid leave. Following the accident, my husband is unable to complete training at this time and is going to be placed on unpaid administrative leave until he is cleared by his doctors to continue training. I understand that in the settlement this will all be paid for due to the lost wages, but in the meantime, we are trying to not have our house foreclosed or our lights turned off, or bills go to collections. I have tried applying for a personal loan and we were denied due to lack of income. He has two small credit cards, and I have one small credit card (total credit borrowed less than $2,000). They are all at about 90% of max. We were denied for all credit increases due to paying the minimum amount and not more. We have been denied opening new lines of credit due to lack of income at this time. We are as prepared as we can be for the baby, and I plan to return to work as soon as I am able.

We do not have any friends or family with the funds to pay our mortgage and bills in the meantime while we wait for the settlement money.  Our church paid our mortgage and electric bill in January when I was put on unpaid maternity leave. I am trying to reach out to other churches and associations in our area but unfortunately most of the population is struggling in this economy and there's only so much money to go around. We have filed a deferment for the mortgage but it is not looking like they will give us more than a month. We already did a loan modification in January which was screwed over by an increase in escrow anyway. We are not eligible for another modification anytime soon. Our monthly expenses are not that high. Total is less than $3,500 a month for mortgage, bills, and utilities.

At this point, I feel like my only option is go fund me and pray. Our community has been wonderful, neighbors and friends helping me with chores, etc. so it's really just figuring out how to pay our bills in the meantime.

Can anyone please give me advice on how to proceed? Is there an option I'm missing? To reiterate, I am not asking anyone here for money, just advice. I'm terrified of being foreclosed on with a newborn because of this car accident.",pregnant,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jbllja/35_weeks_need_advice_what_do_i_do_after_a/

2025-03-15,1742059544.0,"22 weeks pregnant, ignored, dismissed and neglected by multiple clinics and the ER","First I want to start off by giving some background about me. Im a navy medic, I have my EMT license, I taken courses to improve not just emergency medicine but also outpatient clinics. In the last two years, Ive worked in medical research, surgical department, dentistry and paediatrics. My husband is also a medic but a little different where his focus is on tactical/emergency medicine. 

I do not like asking for help, no matter what it is so when I do ask, it means Im at my wits end. Last night was the first time I felt at my absolute lowest point and the last time I felt this way, I was 16 terrified my dad was going to really kill me. He was abusive and had strangled me and I fully accepted that I was going to die but he let me go and it took me a long time after that, after running away and even as an adult to learn how to not jump at the sound of a door opening or closing or to forgive him at a distance. 

Last night, I woke up from the worst cramp in my lower calf and it didnt go away for 20 mins. This wouldnt have worried me so much if it wasnt the 6th time I had generalised cramps that day. I woke up screaming in pain and I called my husband for advice (hes on deployment). In my mind, the worst thing to me was a deep vein thrombosis as Im currently on aspirin to prevent blood clots. I also have hypertension and have been prescribed labetalol and also on anxiety meds. I was going to call an ambulance but I work at this hospital and I didnt want anyone I work with to know I went in. I was in so much pain and I was so scared. 

Neglected: 
I went to the ER front desk hyperventilating and crying in pain. I told them I was having severe cramps in my leg and im 22 weeks pregnant. They told me I need to go to labor and delivery and I was so confused but I was like ok I just need to be seen. THEY SEND ME WITH ONLY DIRECTIONS WHEN IM CRYING AND AUDIBLY DISTRESSED AND IN PAIN TO FIND L&amp;D WHILE WITH AN OBVIOUS GAIT. Little to say I did not find the department and I broke down. I really did not know how to help myself, I left my phone in the car thinking I need to make sure my baby isnt being affected so I couldnt just call for help. I was found by a group of nurses who took me back down to the ER and there was no apology from the front desk. As someone who works in medicine, this truly made me disgusted at the type of treatment patients receive. I then was sent to a room where the nurse was very accomodating and helpful until her turnover. The only thing I will mention is she did not review my medications and questioned why my bp was so high. I had to tell her. After the turnover, no one checked up on me. My monitor was beeping to my bp that was 140s/110s and my pulse in the 120s range. My drip was completely dry and at that point I really needed to use the bathroom. No call button in sight, no one walking past to flag down so as I know how to disconnect myself, I just did it anyway because no one was going to help me. 

I felt like the doctor did listen to my concerns but the ER is to make sure youre not dying so when my labs came back normal, there was nothing more she could do for me which I understand. 

Ignored and dismissed: 
This was not the first time Ive asked for help this week. I was burnt out and went to sick call/ acute care to ask for help for my mental health. I have only been getting 3-4 hours of sleep on average a night the past week due to work load. I was dismissed by sick call by the technician because it was not an acute issue and to schedule with my primary care provider. 
So ok, look at the schedule. Zero availability for the next two weeks which is fine really, if I wasnt about to move cross country in 2 weeks. So after I got dismissed by that clinic and I didnt know what to do but knew I needed help, I went to behavioural health requesting for triage and just like that, no providers were available for triage. If I had not been pregnant, Id honestly consider jumping off the roof at that point but the only reason why I wanted help was because I wanted to make sure my baby was not affected negatively. So since they couldnt help me, I broke down in front of a doctor at work who happened to be a psychiatrist and actually helped me which I appreciate and he was able to speak to my leadership and set somethings in motion. I confessed to him my lack of hygiene, sleep and feeling like it was just all in my head. Ive been wearing diapers because I just dont have the time at work to just go to the bathroom when I need to.

 I went home that day, the sun still out, enjoyed a shower for the first time in a long time and went to bed that night with 7 hours of blissful sleep. Granted, waking up from cramps, it was so amazing. 

Overall, I dont think any of my concerns have been properly addressed and in a way, Im really glad that Im moving to be with my husband in 2 weeks and NOT having the baby here. This has been such an ordeal and I honestly dont know if I could survive postpartum here mentally. Ive completed ICE complaints and am thinking about speaking to the CO myself as how disgusted I am with the service that is basically neglect.

They both said to just come regardless and even though my fiancé is sick with fever, chills, head/body aches, congestion and runny nose he could still come too. Of course we would need to take proper precautions though. 

I continued to finish my preparations last night with the hope that this was just the RSV, that I'm vaccinated from, currently going around but still i woke up this morning with extreme anxiety. Looking at my s.o. hardly able to stand I asked him to take another test. He did and tested positive for flu A. Mind you my fiancé isn't the greatest at self awareness. He has been constantly coughing into his hands and touching everything. The pets, grabbing silverware, light switches, door knobs and cabinets. I'm trying to stay as calm as possible repeatedly disinfecting things behind him and kindly suggesting that he frequently washes his hands, coughs into his shirt and avoids touching everything. 

I felt like my fate had already been sealed and I was about to have a C-section then come down with the flu with a newborn and have no one to help with the baby and C-section recovery. My fiancé is like the typical manly man that gets taken out by illnesses. Nothing against him but I know I wouldn't be able to rely on him to safely take care of the baby while avoiding transmission. So I called labor/delivery and they said they'd have my obgyn call me. He never did so I prepared to go in anyway and once I got there they had him on the phone and he said let's just go ahead and reschedule.

I was initially at first relieved because I can't handle the thought of doing all of this alone while sick. The thought of a newborn with the flu feels like a nightmare. Now I'm reading that pregnancy with the flu can cause still births. I am just so torn because my only concern is our baby and I worry if I made the wrong choice. I'm not sure exactly what I'm asking for on here. Maybe some shared experiences and advice. I wouldn't be able to live with myself if anything happened to my baby girl. My anxiety has been dragging me all over the place. Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read and respond to this.

Currently 12+4 with our < post IVF loss at 12+5 March of last year. As you can imagine Im struggling mentally and emotionally as the sense of loss never really goes away but of course grateful for this spontaneous pregnancy after TTC for 4yrs.

Starting Monday this week my nausea has essentially disappeared, breasts tender but not near as sore as they have consistently been. Im tired, and feel more bloated than normal. But feel like Im functioning more than I have been in the last three months. My nausea has kept me out of work several days in the last few weeks so the almost sudden absence is really sending me for a loop.

Just wanna throw my symptoms out there and see if anyone has had anything similar happen to them.

Im 34+5 weeks and for the last few days I haven't been able to sleep for more than an hour or two at a time because it feels like every muscle from collar bone to crotch tightens up to the point of pain bad enough to wake me up. I can strech and it'll relieve the symptoms for a little while, but it comes right back within an hour. Sleeping propped up at a 45 degree angle helps, but I think that's only because it keeps the little one from being pushed into my chest as hard and squishing my organs when the muscles tighten.

A week ago I did go into preterm labor for about 4 hours. Luckily it stopped on its own before any big problems occurred, but my ob did say that I am not 1 cm dilated and about 50% effaced. The little one did drop into my pelvis and had a lot of pressure for about a day and a half until they came back up on their own. I do have medication available to me now to stop contractions if this happens again for the next 2 weeks where it'll be ok if I go into early labor.

Just know that suddenly no matter what I do I can't keep my muscles from feeling like they're slowly strangling my insides. Fetal movement is good, lots of strong kicks like always.

2025-03-15,1742022860.0,Cant forgive husband for asking for a paternity test.,"TW: loss.

We got married in December 2023. A month or so before the wedding I got off birth control and got pregnant right away. When I was around 7 weeks, my husband asked for a paternity test. It absolutely crushed me, I cried for hours and ended up bleeding. The pregnancy ended a few days later.

I had 4 chemicals after and got pregnant again in August 2024. That pregnancy ended in October 2024. The paternity test hasnt been discussed since and honestly I assumed he got over it considering me tracking each ovulation, making both of us go through many tests to figure out whats wrong, etc.

Long story short- I got pregnant again in November 2024 and am now almost 17 weeks. We had guests over a few weeks ago and I was discussing crazy pregnancy dreams and one of them was giving birth to a baby with a different skin color. Everyone laughed because the discussion was lighthearted but my husband suddenly said something like and then you wonder why I want to do the test. My jaw dropped and the other woman over got very defensive for me.

He brought up the subject again a few days ago and we got in a major fight. He says he doesnt think I cheated but that since this baby stuck, maybe I got inseminated behind his back as maybe his sperm didnt work. I offered to look at all medical records of mine and reminded him of being on a shit ton of medication to sustain this pregnancy.

He stands his ground and basically belittles me and any argument I have about this being hurtful. His main point is that he is a man and has no way of knowing the baby is his.

For context:
I work from home, literally never go out unless I have a female friend over. Never spend any nights away from home and take care of 3 dogs. I physically wouldnt have time to cheat nor have I ever considered doing that. My husband also works from home and has access to all my devices/location on my phone.

I dont know what kind of advice I am looking for. I have not forgiven him for asking for the first paternity test and am simply disgusted by his behavior. 

Edit:

I wanted to thank everyone for weighing in. So much food for thought, I am glad to know I am not overreacting.

2025-03-15,1742038168.0,"30 weeks pregnant, little to no movement in the last 36 hours","I'm 30 weeks pregnant today and so far, baby girl has been very active the entire pregnancy. On all the ultrasounds my doctor said how she's very active and since I started feeling her kicks (started quite late with me around 25 weeks), I can also tell that she's an active one.

But for the last ~36 hours she's completely silent. I felt like 1-2 really minor movements this morning, but other than that, nothing.

I know many babies have a growth spurt at 30 weeks and that can cause them to be move less. But as a mom I'm still worried, as it's so usual for her. I tried to get her to move, moved around myself and carefully massaged my belly to get a reaction from her, but so far nothing has helped.

Should I go to the hospital? Should I wait some more? I would be very thankful for some insight and advice on this =O

UPDATE: I had a CTG done and everything seems to be okay. Of course 5 minutes after starting the CTG, baby girl started kicking.

I'm currently waiting for an ultrasound to be on the save side, but the midwife said she expects me to be able to go home real soon.

Thanks to everyone for being concerned for baby girl and me!

2025-03-14,1741991016.0,"My husband wants more kids, are my conditions unreasonable?","When I met my husband I was a fence sitter. Over time I warmed up the idea and decided Id be okay with one baby. Husband wanted three, but was glad I was open to one. We got married and after a year of trying I got pregnant with my little girl who is due in June.

Now tell me why this man is watching me suffer and is already talking about a second baby??
We had discussed right before I got pregnant that I MIGHT do two, but we dont know what pregnancy and parenthood will be like and Im not rushing to make that decision before we see what life is like with a baby.

He keeps saying the baby needs a sibling and he really wants a boy and a girl. I thought on it and decided under certain conditions I could be open to one more, definitely not three.

My conditions: 
1. We must be comfortable with the political and economical climate at the time specifically in regard to womens rights and maternal rights.

2. After breast feeding husband pays for a breast lift and tummy tuck if needed.

3. He must be okay with stopping at 2 even if we have another daughter. By stopping at 2 I mean he will get a vasectomy.

Husband is willing to accept 1-2 and says even if its another girl hed gladly stop at 2 babies so she can have a sibling. 

However, he says he will not get a vasectomy. I explained in detail how its reversible and much safer than me getting my tubes tied. He insists we can continue to use condoms and plan B as needed. I told him currently in the USA they are working to ban birth control, abortion, and plan b and we will have no fall back if I get pregnant at 40 which we both agree we wouldnt want another kid at that age.

Is this unreasonable? He says he doesnt want to mess with his downstairs and I rolled my eyes and reminded him what Im doing to my body for us to have a child.

My husband has been kind and taken good care of me through this, but I feel Ive compromised a lot and met him half way on our ideals with what our family will be like. Is a vasectomy really asking too much??

Edit: Id like to point out as there seems to be some confusion. Id never force my husband to have a vasectomy. Its simply a condition if he wants a second child which is something he wants.

2025-03-15,1742042496.0,Husband keeps putting his phone on airplane mode,"Im 36 weeks pregnant and I live at home with my husband who has a difficult time sleeping. He often goes to sleep in the guest bedroom down the hall.

I dont mind typically, since I know he struggles with sleeping. However now that Im deep in the third trimester, I need him to be available. And often during the night&he isnt.

2 weeks ago, I had very bad pains for an hour that stopped me from being able to switch sides or even get out of bed. I felt like a beached whale. I tried calling him and texting him, but his phone was on do not disturb and he didnt add me as a person to get through to him when I needed to. After about 20 mins, I was able to get up and crouch my way over to the room down the hall where I angrily woke him up. Bc hes such a disturbed sleeper, he anxiously started yelling what what what! At the top of his lungs at me. I was really upset, bc I felt when I needed him around for our baby, he wasnt there. He was angry for about ten minutes that I woke him up and was grumbling about how I get to nap during the day and he doesnt, but I wasnt having any of it. Respectfully I told him to shut his mouth and do/say nothing unless its about being there for me. Im Puerto Rican and I dont play that . Turns out the baby dropped 2 centimeters!

A couple days later, Im up in the am and hes still sleeping in. My 2 40 pound dogs are on me and Im so big I cant get them off. I try calling him, since I made myself a do not disturb contact and wouldnt you know, he put on his airplane mode! So I couldnt reach him regardless. His excuse was well I went to the other room at 6 am and I figured you were up and youd be fine. Suffice it to say, I was NOT happy. I told him he cant do this, that he needs to be reachable at all times, even if Im just downstairs. 
What if I fall? What if Im in pain again and cant move? What if the dogs wont let me get up? I said if he did it again, there would be big problems.

Now today, same thing. This time, he slept in the other room all night and the dogs are crying to be walked and Im texting/calling him..his phone is off. Im trying to yell for him..but he isnt hearing me. He also planned on waking up this am to go for a quick shake out run since hes running a half marathon tmrw. His mother is landing from Minnesota in a half hour and hes not up. I made it clear that we need to turn over the guest room for her, and need to sweep downstairs. I cleaned pretty much the whole house in prep for her yesterday. Went to Costco to do my final prep run for freezer meal prep for us, so he doesnt lose his mind cooking meals and making a mess bc I wont be able to help much, AND went to his race expo with him to pick up his bib and help him navigate it. Its his first big formal race and Ive ran multiple halfs and a marathon. So wanted to show my support for him.

Why is she coming? Bc he needs to go to a work conference for a week in Utah and the only way Id let him go is if he made sure someone was with me. Bc Im always tired and always need some help.

Am I being a brat or unreasonable to want my husband to not put his need for sleep over making himself available to me in my last month of pregnancy? He is other wise a wonderful husband during the day for the most part. Helps me clean the kitchen after I cook, will do some laundry, help clean the bathroom when I ask, walk the dogs when he can etc. He can be a little selfish from time to time with his day, but who cant? 

Im just getting so annoyed that I have to keep having this convo with him and Im debating telling his mother. Although I dont know what that will do..she tends to coddle him lol. Ive done a lot of work to get him to be less coddled lol. Ive also done a lot of work to get myself to a point where I dont just pop off on him. Being a New Yorker and Latina, thats my instinct. But he doesnt respond well to that and says Im being disrespectful and wont engage with me.

Sorry for the rant everyone. Any advice? Am I being nuts? Thanks!

Update: I popped off on him via text and told him Im telling both of our parents he keeps doing this. He said sorry and that his phone gets put on airplane mode automatically and its just habit. Well it wasnt a habit when he had it on do not disturb and we got into a fight over that right? Now that I can reach him through DND, now its a years long habit lol. I just told him that the fact that he didnt make it a priority to be cognizant of before bed shows how careless and selfish hes being.  I def got tough and rude with him and he told me to stop a few times, which promptly got met with a stfu >7<ý@. Now hes up and trying to check and see if Im ok.

Having kids has always been a well see thing, at the back of my mind, because Ive prioritized career stuff until now. I thought that Id eventually go off the pill and see what happens when I felt ready. Ive prepared myself for a future where its too late or not in the cards. But I never prepared myself for jumping right to the getting pregnant part. On one hand, I dont know if Im ready for my life to completely change. But another part of me is thinking& even though it wasnt the plan, maybe this is my time? Im terrified of making the wrong decision.

Im grateful to live somewhere where I have a choice, and to have a supportive network and stable income but Im still scared and uncertain and this all feels way too adult to be real life.

I went from 230lb down to 170lb over a year and a half. It was slow and steady, clean eating and being active. Part of the reason I wanted to lose weight was bc I wanted to be able to see my baby bump sooner after conceiving.

I thought having the healthy habits already established would help me eat well and stay active during pregnancy. 


Wrong. Im 14 weeks now. At my 10 week appt I had already gained 20lbs. 20 fucking lbs in 10 weeks. Idk where Im at now, Im scared to check. Im huge. My stomach is huge. None of my clothes fit. I cant keep googling weight gain during pregnancy bc all I see is the literature saying youre only supposed to gain 1 - 5 lbs in the first trimester. I see all the articles about how Im hurting my baby by gaining weight too quickly, that Im going to get GD and my baby is going to be too big and Im risking pre term birth or making it more likely that Ill need a c section. Idk how to slow the weight gain down without straight up restricting, and Im terrified to restrict bc I dont want to hurt baby

I have woken up to myself choking on my own vomit/stomach acid more than once, despite sleeping popped up on pillows. I didnt know whether to label this post as a rant or seeking advice. I feel like the only thing that will help at this point is giving birth. I wish I could fast forward to the end. I try to remind myself at least I dont have other symptoms like sciatica (yet) or GD. I dont know. Im exhausted every day even though I dont really accomplish anything. Doing a load of laundry is a big task these days. I literally do not even remember what it feels like to feel normal, kindof like when youve had a cold for weeks and you cant even remember what it feels like to breathe through your nose (which funnily enough, Ive also had constant rhinitis since October.)

Maybe this is just a rant. I alternate between tums, gasx, Pepcid, etc its like Ive tried everything and it only kindof helps. Maybe Ill ask my OB for a refill of reglan bc it feels like food just sits and rots in me and doesnt move along like its supposed to. Pregnancy is just so sucky and hard and honestly lonely. I dont have any pregnant friends and my mom and MIL and husband are all supportive but its like idk what can anyone say? I hate how my mom hasnt been pregnant in decades and has clearly forgotten (or maybe really never experienced) how truly awful it is. Everyone just wants to celebrate how magical it is and meanwhile I hate this. Im so excited to finally be a mom and have my son, but everything else about this experience is ass. I have a feeling the third trimester is just going to slowly become more and more uncomfortable until I get to the point where I just want to do nothing but lay around like Jabba the Hut until my body decides its going to attempt to expel a whole ass human from my vajayjay. My baby is the reward at the end, but even then its like out of the frying pan and into the fire with birth, breastfeeding, sleeplessness, etc. 

Im grateful for this sub bc otherwise Id have nowhere else to scream into the void about this stuff. You guys all rock. You are all warriors and I respect every single one of you simply for the fact that you are surviving pregnancy. Feel free to commiserate in the comments so I feel less alone.

I got lucky and my annual exam ended up being my first appointment at 5w. All was looking good. Then I had some spotting so of course I worried. No cramps, no flow so I tried to remain calm. 

My next appt was at 8w and I was convinced Id get bad news, all was good, strong heartbeat and we got to see the little bean>. Then I had more frequent spotting sometimes bleeding so more freaking out. It seemed like the longest two weeks waiting for my next appointment.

Next up, 10w and NIPT. Baby was looking good, strong heartbeat. Then came waiting for the results so more worry. Results came in 2 days ago: low risk baby girl=. I felt brief excitement for 2 days and then last night, more spotting/bleeding and some light cramping. So Im back to worrying.

My next appt is 3/17 for NT screening and I am emotionally exhausted. Part of my worry is my doctor hasnt found a reason for the bleeding. But I feel like I should be riding the high of baby being ok every time I go in.

I eventually got hungry again, about 5 hours later, and ate a handful of walnuts which made my stomach hurt.

Hello everyone!

FTM(31) here, 19 + 6. I had my regular prenatal appointment the other day, and one thing my doctor mentioned really stuck with me. She said its super important to stay active and keep my muscles in shape for the delivery. I didnt think much of it at the time, but now I'm starting to wonder what exactly she meant.

I've been going to the gym religiously (5 days a week for 1.5-2 hours) for the past 2-3 years. But since getting pregnant, I stopped going due to extreme fatigue in the first trimester. 
Now that Im starting to get my energy back, Im really struggling. Im almost always short of breath (just by existing) and cant even last 15 minutes on the stairmaster (level 6) without wheezing. 

I used to love lifting, but I cant even lift half the weight I used to pre-pregnancy. Honestly, even walking around the neighborhood feels exhausting.

What my doctor said really got me thinking and has me a bit worried, to be honest. Im wondering if anyone here can help me understand what she meant by keeping muscles in shape for delivery.

Is she referring to a specific muscle group? Or is it more about cardio? Im just feeling a bit lost on this one.

I love to garden and the weather is warming up, but I cant really because of the above.

We also like to hike which I cant do. Babys room is mostly done, but even messing around in there doesnt sound interesting anymore. I cant go shopping, because what is there to buy that would fit me or look good?

During the week I have work, so I at least have a focus, but on the weekends theres literally nothing that I feel like I can do that sounds interesting. So I just sit here and gestate like a sad sack. Its such a bummer and I miss feeling like myself.

2025-03-15,1742042904.0,CMV: Cancer Kills MillionsCutting Research Is A Disservice To Both Current and Future Generations,"**Cancer remains deadly today**\- more specifically, **pancreatic cancer** is one of the **most notorious and deadliest cancers**it should be receiving **significantly more funding, not less**. Yet, the **Senate just passed a budget slashing Department of Defense (DoD) cancer research funding by 57%, including pancreatic cancer.**

**This is personal for me.** My wife was diagnosed with **stage 4 pancreatic cancer at 35 years old while pregnant with our second child.** In a matter of weeks, our lives became a cycle of hospital visits, treatments, and fighting to survive.

Since her diagnosis, Ive met other young families facing the same battleparents in their 30s, with little kids, fighting a disease typically seen in people more than twice their age. But despite how devastating pancreatic cancer is, advancements in cancer research have offered hope that even the deadliest diseases may one day be managed as chronic conditions. Progress in other cancers proves that with the right funding and research, survival doesnt have to be out of reach.

Its hard to comprehend why one of the deadliest cancers is being deprioritized when it already lags behind in treatment advancements. Id love to hear other perspectives, but heres why these budget cuts are a major problemboth now and for the future:

**1. Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers &amp; is on the rise.**

* **Cases are rising each year**, with a growing number of diagnoses among young adults- particularly an increasing trend in women.
* **80% of patients die within a year** of diagnosis. About **12% survive five years**.
* Most cases are diagnosed at **stage 4, when its too late for a cure.**
* At **stage 4, 99 out of 100 patients do not survive beyond five years.**

**2. Fewer survivors mean fewer advocates.**

* Other cancers have **large survivor communities** that successfully push for research funding.
* **Pancreatic cancer patients rarely live long enough** to fight for change.
* This creates a **vicious cycle**: **Less advocacy  Less funding  Fewer treatments  More deaths.**

**3. Treatment progress is painfully slow.**

* Other cancers have seen **major breakthroughs in targeted therapies and immunotherapy.**
* **Pancreatic cancer is still treated with just two toxic chemo regimens**, which only extend life **by months, and many do not respond to chemo.**
* **Cutting research funding now means fewer chances to develop better treatments.**

**4. Theres a direct link between funding and survival rates.**

* The **5-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer has improved in the past five years**alongside an increase in research funding.
* **My wife is a rare beneficiary of the progress from cancer research and would be eligible to** a \*\*new FDA-approved drug (\*\*Zenocutuzumab) developed in the past few years.
* **If research funding is cut, breakthroughs like this will slow down, and more patients will be left without options.**

**5. The Senate passed a budget cutting $200 million from DoD cancer research programs, which fund high-risk, high-reward treatments.**

* **DoD programs are critical** for early-stage, high-risk research that aren't always funded elsewhere.
* Thanks to past funding, **these programs have led to breakthrough treatments**, including:
   * CAR T-cell therapy  revolutionized leukemia and lymphoma treatment.
   * XPOVIO® (Selinexor)  an FDA-approved treatment for blood cancers.
   * Personalized cancer vaccines  offering hope for hard-to-treat cancers like pancreatic.
* These life-saving treatments exist today because of **past research investments**.
* **Slashing funding now will stall progress, delay new discoveries, and limit future treatment options for deadly cancers.**

We know government funding is limited, and budget decisions are complex. But when a cancer this lethal gets its research budget suddenly cut in half, I have to ask- Whats the rationale?

# So, change my view:

* **Why shouldnt pancreatic cancer research be a much bigger funding priority?**
* **Why should we cut cancer research?**",changemyview,126.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jbudb7/cmv_cancer_kills_millionscutting_research_is_a/
2025-03-15,1742009542.0,#Saytheirnames: 18-year-old Alexis Lexi Arguello (USA 2025),"18-year-old Alexis Lexi Arguello had just moved into her own apartment and was preparing to start her adult life when Planned Parenthoods negligence killed her.

Shortly after moving out, Lexi suffered a urinary tract infection, went to get medical treatment and found out that she was pregnant. Likely not sure what her next steps should be, Lexi ended up the Fort Collins Planned Parenthood facility. She was told that she was 20 weeks pregnant. Although the facilitys website claimed that they only did abortions before 20 weeks, they scheduled Lexi for one anyway. 

During the abortion, Lexi suffered life-threatening side effects. It was obvious that she needed emergency medical treatment (which Planned Parenthood did not provide and was in no way equipped for), but the staff delayed in calling an ambulance and let her deteriorate. When they finally did call the ambulance, they tried to conceal the damage done by requesting that the ambulance not use sirens. 

This was not unusual for the facility. Witness reports from protesters and numerous dispatch records documented that the facility's frequent emergencies were  mishandled in a similar way. Life-threatening medical complications were downplayed, and time and time again Planned Parenthood tried to hide what they did to their clients. Ambulances were requested to come without sirens and were frequently directed by staff to use convoluted and indirect routes to make it less obvious that they had yet another emergency. They even had paramedics approach the back instead of using the more accessible main entrance. The ""silent siren treatment"" left Lexi suffering without help for even longer, delaying care and decreasing her chances at survival.

On February 6, the day of the abortion, Lexi's grandparents were told that she was in the emergency room. Her family hadn't even known she was pregnant, and now they arrived to find her in the hospital with doctors desperately struggling to keep her alive. She had lost so much blood that a transfusion of seven liters still didn't improve her condition, and the multiple doses of epinephrine were not enough to keep her heart beating. Her oxygen was too low and despite the best attempts of the ER, her grandparents had *seen in [Lexi's] face that it was her end.* Her blood pressure and heart rate dropped again, and she died the same day as her baby.

Lexi's devastated family wanted to find some semblance of justice for her and will take her killers to court with the help of Pro-Life organization Operation Rescue. A report of what happened to Lexi was also given to the  Colorado Committee of Health and Human Services at a hearing.

The hearing was about a bill that would require abortion facilities in Colorado to follow health and safety regulations in a similar way to medical clinics. Expert witness Dr. Keri Kasun gave testimony on what an unrestricted and unregulated Planned Parenthood had done. She confirmed that Planned Parenthood had delayed Lexis emergency treatment and stated that Lexi had been showing obvious symptoms of an amniotic fluid embolism. The risk of this complication is elevated for abortions later in pregnancy, and Lexi was even further along than she had been told at 22 weeks pregnant. (A premature baby born at this age could survive when given care.)

Amniotic fluid in the bloodstream would impair clotting abilities, making any injuries inflicted on Lexi much more dangerous. The further delays by not treating this as the emergency it was made everything worse.

In response to the bill and to the investigation of their egregious actions, the Public Affairs Manager for Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains (which oversees the oversees Fort Collins chain location) argued that they shouldnt be supervised or regulated and called the corporation a beacon of hope that would ""always fight for their patients"". But as Troy Newman from Operation Rescue put it, **This Planned Parenthood did not care if Lexi Arguello survived her complications. If they had, staff would have called an ambulance the minute she exhibited symptoms, and they would have requested lights, sirens, and any other measures that might have saved Lexis life.**

2025-03-15,1742024357.0,My person is being distant after the abortion,"hi everyone, Im 23 (f) and hes a 27 (m). In the last post I expressed how I had an abortion with the person I was seeing. I am fully recovered physically but mentally and emotionally disoriented. My person was somewhat supportive throughout the process but not exactly how I wanted him to be. He was going out a lot and speaking with other females. Me and him arent fully in a relationship but I wouldve appreciated him investing his time into me during these times. Recently he has been doing things that have been getting on my nerves. He would always plan to see me but cancel on the very last minute. He did this a good 3 times. He would reach out to me and call me to hang out but once I get ready he would flake. I feel like he was doing it on purpose and I called him out on his behaviour and decided to delete him and move on because I dont deal with men like that. He would constantly message/call apologising and would make more plans. I would forgive him naturally because of the soft spot I had for him during the pregnancy. If it wasnt for that, I wouldve disappeared. Just recently Ive seen him partying through other peoples instagram/snapchat stories and I thought it would be funny blowing up his phone. He took this to heart and told me can you stop being so clingy, I came out of a 5 year relationship she was clingy and I dont like it. I fuck with you but stop. He called me clingy in the past to but I never too it as offensive. This hurt my feelings because he said it out of anger.  I was just doing it to be annoying and he took it for a complete different meaning. It wasnt the best idea. I think he thinks I want a relationship with him because of natural loving nature. I am affection and loving to people and love to give. My plan during our time together wasnt to fall in love. However, with the excessive love bombing, he would say things like im falling in love, or when you become my mrs he would talk about marriage a lot in the beginning. Kinda scared me because I know what he was trying to do. I wanted to keep things causal but since I got pregnant I grew an attachment with him as any woman wouldve. He makes me feel bad for it and when I try to express my emotions he shuts down. Theres been loads of times he has annoyed me but I forgave him and moved on. In this case, I deleted him from social media out of hurt and few days later I tried to message on iMessage and hes giving me the silent treatment. Bear in mind we were together a week before the argument, having sex. He hasnt blocked me from iMessage but when I try to request him he ignores the request. When I did this in the past he said you can stay there and learn your lesson. When I was pregnant with him. Im not sure exactly what to do now, I want to leave one last message before I fully move on as I feel like one day sooner or later. Hes going to try to reconnect and Im going to feel emotionally disoriented again. I want to take this time to heal and fully move on without being disturbed. 



This is the message I want to leave 

I have to say I find your actions really selfish. There have been so many times when youve annoyed me, and Ive brushed it off and forgiven you. I did something to annoy you once, it wasnt the best idea, but I did it. I apologised, and Im ready to move on from it. But youre still taking it personally and saying things unprovoked. I never once said I wanted anything serious with you apologies if I gave you the wrong impression, but Im just a loving person, whether Im close to someone or not. Whats really hard to understand is that youre getting angry because I felt attached. Any woman in my position would have felt that way. And to make me feel bad about it, especially after everything Ive been through physically, emotionally, and mentally, feels inconsiderate. I dont understand why this is such a sensitive topic for you when Ive gone through it. This isnt me trying to argue with you but choosing to communicate better. You can continue with the silent treatment if you want, but just know that you wont hear from me again. 

Let me know if its a good idea or just to move on in silent. Any advice would help. ",abortion,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jbpynl/my_person_is_being_distant_after_the_abortion/

For context I was 22 weeks on the dot and in California for the procedure. I also went to a planned parenthood.
I found out I was pregnant a month and a half before my abortion. I have super irregular periods, had no symptoms, no bump, nothing. When I found out I figured I was not far along and had an at home medical abortion that failed. I bled but my pregnancy test was never negative after that. I then decided to tell my boyfriend and my mom and booked an appointment at pp. My first appointment they ultrasound me and I was 21 weeks. I was in shock and soon after I started to feel him kick. They let me know it would be a two day procedure. I was terrified at first. I have extremely bad medical ptsd and am beyond terrified of doctors and needles. I did not sleep at all that week, but soon the fear of needles subsided and I was just sad. I spent a week feeling him kick. I felt like a mother and was so attached. I was two weeks away from the cut off in California and I made my choice for several reasons. Since I was unknowingly pregnant I was drinking for months and months while pregnant. I am also an avid vaper. On top of that I had the medical abortion. I could not live with myself if I brought a child into this world with chronic health issues, as that was what happened to me. I was put up for adoption and had chronic medical issues and hence the medical trauma. I felt I did not have enough time to check for health issues and I did not feel comfortable bringing a child into a world where I am not financially stable. I want to give my child the world and right now I was not capable of that. Me and my partner were adopted and know what the other side of that looks like so that could never be an option for us. I was overcome with grief but I knew what the right choice was, no matter how hard it was and still is. The first day of the procedure was the scariest for me. This was when they did the fetal injection to end the heart beat and did the dilation sticks. I was sick to my stomach over that shot, but I voiced that to my doctor and she could not have handled me better. She talked to me about my life the whole way through the procedure. The injection did not hurt, it was uncomfortable because I could feel how deep the needle was. The dilation sticks also did not hurt as she numbed me. The numbing shot was probably the most uncomfortable of them all but bearable. The next day I went in for the procedure and they knocked me out stone cold. I worked myself up for a lot of nothing.

2025-03-15,1742030442.0,We both want abortion but my wife can't get over the fears from her beliefs. How can i help her?,"Hi guys,

I seriously need your help on this, and this is a long one.

We just got married, and we f'd up. We know this is our mistake and we are blaming ourselves for letting this happen.

My wife and I just found out she's pregnant a few days ago, just a month after our wedding. The scan we did yesterday didn't even show the embryo inside the uterus, so we still have time to decide what to do. It's very early. It's too early even to do a MA. Now our initial reaction and up to even now after a few days is that we are not ready to have kids. We still want to enjoy our lives and no matter how we go through the scenarios in our head and together, we can not imagine and cannot accept the reality that there will be a children in our life, at least at this time. We fully believe having a kid will more likely leave us with more suffering, and unhappiness. We've talked to great lengths about this and agree that we will be most happy and content with just each other.

But my wife is a firm believer in Buddhist teachings, and she believes that we'd be committing a major sin, akin to murder and she seems to be unable to overcome this to get the courage to make the final decision. And i don't know how to help her get through this. I believe that the decision we want to make will lead to less sufferings, and better for all parties involved. But I fear that if we decide to have an abortion, she will also not be happy and will be in tremendous mental pain and I don't know if she will even be able to heal from it.

We are also super torn due to the fact that other than our own selfish needs and the vision that we have for our life together, there's no other reason to have this abortion. We are happily in love, both our families are well off, incredibly kind, helpful to us and will be over the moon if we reveal to them about the pregnancy. There's no real financial strain to speak of to take care of the baby if we let this happen. In our culture people believe that having children is a blessing, so there's no chance of talking to anyone else in our families about this, because we will face massive judgements that will make it impossible to even speak about an abortion, so that leaves us alone to work this out.

I've tried to convince my wife that this is not a crime, and we are making this decision believing it will be best for our life together, that what ever is inside her right now is not yet a living human being, and if we make this decision with kindness in our hearts, there is no need to fear of guilt, karma or anything like that. But she is dismissing me everytime I mention it and doesnt want or unable to let go of her strong beliefs. I can see that she's in the middle of a crossroads and cannot find a way out that she can accept. She's in great pain, and I'm feeling it too.

2025-03-15,1742027301.0,Nervous! Question (and ramble) regarding GP,"So Im currently 7 weeks pregnant, if my workings out are correct.
Ive decided on an abortion as my partner and I just arent ready at this time - were looking for a bigger house as we are in a tiny house with no space for anything and we are trying to improve our quality of life.
I am an anxious person and I understand that having a baby is going to be stressful and an anxious time, and If we are going to do it at some point, I want to remove as much of that anxiety as possible. I feel having a bigger house and being in a space where we can do it at least removes some of that anxiety. I genuinely cannot see us with a baby in this space currently. 
I did come off the pill about a year ago as I didnt want to be on it anymore and at that point we sort of said just see what happens, but have been careful and used condoms where we could. Since then my anxiety/OCD has gotten worse and now its actually happened I just cant go through with it, for our sake and a childs sake.
I did go to my GP last week as I had some bleeding and cramps (which he said were normal) and the pregnancy was confirmed there and documented on my record.
I told him I was no longer on the pill and he asked me if I was keeping the pregnancy. I panicked and said yes as I was scared hed judge me when Id just said I came off the pill.
Now I have my consultation next week and Im worried that when the GP surgery finds out Ive had a termination that I will get in trouble.
I know you dont have to tell your doctor but as its on my record that Im pregnant, I dont want to turn up at a next appointment (whenever that may be) and they think Im still pregnant.
Any advice please?

I also noticed my breasts became sore again and I have many montgomery glands (similar to bumps ) on my nipple area. I used to have them when I found out I was pregnant.
All of the symptoms I had during the pregnancy disappeared but now I just feel so disturbed because I have no period and have the same symptoms again. I have been wondering if anyone experienced this? I dont feel ready to go back to the doctor again as im traumatized from that place and I live in a country where its illegal.
I really fear that my SA failed or the doctor messed up when he said my uterus is empty on the ultrasound. Could it be possible? Im freaking out. Could I possibly be still pregnant or is this the normal process?

I slept with a  situationship who told me he loved me and had feelings for me and got pregnant. I wont say it was completely unplanned as we were drunk, he said do you want my babies, I said yes. 

Fast forward 5 weeks later I find out I am pregnant. I was initially excited but then we had a conversation and  I realised he was really excited to have a child but wasnt sure if he wanted to get to get to know me or try be in a serious relationship.

I asked him why he had previously told me he loved me and he said, that he didnt know why but that we would be alright. 

I know that he has a visa that limits him on the type of companies that will sponsor him, which is something he complains about everytime we speak. I am scared he is going to use our child to get a family visa.

I also have an underlying condition which could cause me to have a difficult pregnancy and having to go through all that by myself, will be difficult.

2025-03-15,1742062747.0,Confused on logic and rights,"I recently did a deep dive and it left me confused. My issue is that I still don't have a genuine grasp on the logistics behind PL. I understand that PL views every fetus as a full-blown person with rights. However, rights come with the clause of not being able to take away someone else's rights no matter how small they seem in comparison. This should extend to the fetus if they are a full-blown human. That is where my logic leads me. Even if we take away the status of human with rights leaving them with just human life, the PP can still use their bodily autonomy to remove it. 


Furthermore, it's not the fetuses fighting against abortion it is born people. It's people with peens and uterus. By taking away one uterus owner's bodily autonomy you take away all bodily autonomy for current and future uterus owners. That is what having equal rights is about no matter how big or small the person is their rights are equal. If you give yourself the right to decide on someone else's behalf the same can be said in reverse. You cause a car accident and you're the perfect match for the person who got hurt you can and will be forced to save them. I understand being morally against something but you can't turn it into legislation that takes away rights from people currently alive and future generations. Jehovah's Witnesses don't believe in blood transfusions but they don't turn it into legislation because not everyone believes what they do and they would be taking away people's RTL. This is where my logic leads.  


In contrast, the PC logic seems streamlined to me. You have the right to bodily autonomy meaning you control what happens to or inside your body. If you end up pregnant and don't want to be you have the right to end that pregnancy. You end up pregnant and you want it congratulations hope you enjoy the journey. When applying the fetus has rights, not much changes. You end up pregnant and don't want to be, it's in your body and it can't take away your right to keep itself alive nor can any born person. You end up pregnant and you want it congrats on the pregnancy. It's beginning to feel more and more like your rights matter as long as there isn't a fetus involved.

2025-03-15,1742070086.0,"Do Women Have a Moral Duty to Keep Their Bodies ""Ready"" for Reproduction at All Times?","Late last year, Dr. Rebecca Gomperts (Aid Access, Women on Waves) announced results of a large clinical trial in Moldova, testing the use of a weekly low dose of mifepristone (50 mg) as a contraceptive. The results were promising, with only one pregnancy occurring within 2000 cycles. Furthermore, negative side effects were minimal, with only 4% of the participants experiencing any negative side effects (compared to a 40% negative side effect rate for conventional hormonal contraceptives). Additionally, the low-dose mifepristone was easier to use, requiring only one dose a week, and being more ""forgiving"" of variations in the time the pill is taken. And 89% of the study participants reported that they stopped menstruating while taking mifepristone as a contraceptive. (Probably most women would consider this a positive side effect.)

Because of the positive results, the trials have been expanded to the Netherlands this year. If the results continue to be positive, the plan is to apply to the European Medicines Agency for registration and market authorization to allow this weekly, low-dose mifepristone regimen as a contraceptive throughout the EU.

The method of action for mifepristone as birth control is two-fold: it reduces the rate of ovulation and it thins the endometrial lining of the uterus, making it impossible for a fertilized egg to implant.

([Source](https://msmagazine.com/2025/01/07/mifepristone-weekly-contraceptive-clinical-trials-abortion-pill-birth-control/).)

My primary question for PL supporters is this: 

* Would you have any moral or legal objections to women's use of such a contraceptive? If so, on what grounds?

Here are some secondary questions if you believe that the use of this contraceptive would be immoral:

* If a woman was taking mifepristone as described here *as a contraceptive* and informed her partner that she was doing this before they had sex, and if her partner, knowing this, decided to go ahead and have PIV sex with her, and if one of his sperm fertilized an egg but it failed to implant, whose would be the primary responsibility for the ""death"" of the fertilized egg? (Realistically, neither of them would ever know if this happened, so this is a hypothetical question.)
* *Men's* use of tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, red meat, and food high in trans fats during the months before their partners' conception is associated with higher miscarriage rates, because of these substances' impacts on sperm. ([Source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/a-mans-unhealthy-lifestyle-too-can-lead-to-his-partners-pregnancy-loss/articleshow/64072130.cms?from=mdr).)  If men engage in such unhealthy lifestyles, they are not maintaining their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction, and their choices could result in the ""death"" of a fertilized egg or even an embryo or fetus. Do they have a moral duty to maintain their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction by refraining from such lifestyle choices?",Abortiondebate,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jc47ep/do_women_have_a_moral_duty_to_keep_their_bodies/
2025-03-14,1741988561.0,"""Pretending"" to be PL, do I pass?","I almost wanted to make this post from an anonymous account to really make this a more authentic thought experiment but felt like that would be a pushing if not trampling sub rules so doing it like this instead. I'm tagging it as ""question for PL"" as its mostly aimed there, but there are a couple things for PC as well.

**What I want to do:** 

I will present a stance and arguments as if I am PL. I will do so to the best of my ability, providing multiple of the most reasonable arguments I know of. I won't go ham on ALL details, but enough as to get the gist of the reasons behind my pretend stance. It will still be in my own ""voice"" as a debatee though, and will not use arguments that I find completely bogus (religious, consent to sex is consent to pregnancy, appeal to nature, etc). So don't hold that against me. After I will ask a few questions. Keep in mind that that the idea of the post is not necessarily in the arguments I'm presenting themselves but more in my (and by extension other PC with similar view points) ability to understand the PL view. So here goes:

**The argument:**

During fertilization, a unique entity with human DNA is created. The exact point as to when this entity should legally become a person is hard to pin point as it can change due to technology and is subject to a lot of semantic and philosophical ideas regarding personhood and law. So, my go to is to err on the side of caution and say that it should be treated as a legal person from the moment its existence is known, i.e. fertilization. This seems as the more morally sensible choice as it is better to err on the side of giving the entity more rights, that of a legal person, rather than less and risk being in the moral wrong later.

From there, since we are talking about a person with the same rights as others. This includes the right to life, which should ensure that a person is not deprived of their life, or any other right, for that matter without due process. When abortions are legal, a female person is able for any reason kill the fetus, and thus taking away their right to life without due process. Although we allow killing in self defense, even after the incident is done there would be an investigation to determine if the lethal measure was justified. This happens whenever any person is killed. Without banning abortion, this investigation would never happen, and since I think there are times in which an abortion is an unjustified use of lethal force, it should in fact occur.

So, abortion should be banned with exceptions so that it is only used in certain cases where lethal force is justified. Specifically, when there is a particular medical reason that can be named by a doctor for having the abortion outside of that from ""normal pregnancy symptoms"". This is also in part because the fetus it self has done nothing wrong, as it is incapable of having intent and acting on it. As such, it would be a moral and legal wrong for them to be killed when they have not committed a crime. Although having the female person carry the pregnancy to term may have adverse affects for them, it is a greater wrong for the law to allow a person to be killed when they could have otherwise lived.

Although forcing female people to gestate against their will may be unfortunate as a side effect, the law should err on the side of keeping persons alive in this case. Especially since unlike organ donation they are forcing inaction, rather than forcing a procedure. The female could be compensated and their struggles alleviated, weather they be social, financial or otherwise, using other government programs instead of allowing them to kill the person causing them.

It is not ideal, but it is the better status quo than persons being killed for unjustifiable reasons without due process. As a society, we should strive for the over all well being of everybody, and killing a person who has done nothing wrong goes against that. Everybody deserves a chance at life unless there are severe extenuating circumstances and in vast majority of cases, a pregnancy by it self does not constitute those.

**The questions, geared toward PL:**

1. If you are PL, if you read this without knowing I am PC, would you believe I am PL? As in, do you believe I represented  your views and arguments, or at least ones close to your stance justifiably? If no, what did I miss or what gives me away?

2. If you answered yes to 1, then lets go back to the fact that I AM vehemently, no restrictions PC. Considering I, supposedly, understand and know your arguments enough to present them in a way you find acceptable, why do you think that is?

3. Are you in response, regardless of how ""accurate"" you think my ""post"" is able to provide a counter argument as if you are PC? If you do so, do you feel like you would be able to ""pass"" as a PC? Feel free to attempt to do so as answer to this question as well.

**More questions, geared towards PC:**

1. Do you think I ""pass"" as PL? If not could you do better and where?

2. If a PL person demonstrated the same amount of understanding of the PC stance as I have demonstrated about PL, why do you think they are still PL? (This is meant to be a mirror of question 2 for the PL, sorry for the weird wording)

**Both can answer:**

If you were to guess, who do you think would do better at this ""pretend to be the other side"" exercise, PL or PC?

2025-03-15,1742067852.0,Intimacy in Catholic marriage. I need help.,"Throwaway because well, this is so embarassing. I know there are ""dead bedroom"" type subs but I would like to hear from those with a Catholic perspective and not.

Married 20 years, both in our 40s, our sex life has never been incredible and there have always been things in our way but it's also not been bad. Our current situation is one I just don't know how to navigate. I stopped hormonal birth control a year ago. I had erroneously been told for decades I ""needed"" it for my health, so we've had to learn charting and what days are safe to avoid pregnancy. If it happens, of course I will accept God's blessing and plan, but another child is not something I am actively trying to have. There's been some learning with that and my body wasn't really lining up as it should to start so it definitely delayed some of intimacy but it's more than that.

We're averaging once a month right now and neither of us are happy about it. I think a lot of it is my fault. I don't know how to overcome this and I feel so broken. My husband is also saying that he doesn't feel wanted or that I'm excited to be with him. That's not true, I really do want to be with him in my head but when it comes time to act, it falls apart. Things I feel are ""in the way""

* Privacy - we still have to two teens at home and our bedroom is right next to theirs and our bed is LOUD, lol. We have another space we use but there is no lock so my brain is always on alert of being discovered. ...I feel this issue is eventually fixable once we can fix the room and a add door knob that locks. It isn't quite as easy as just changing hardware though, the whole room is chaos. 
* Self esteem - I've never been a very confident lover, some stuff early in our marriage took that down a few pegs more and now I'm easily 70-80lbs overweight and just feel .... gross. My husband has also put on some weight (so he has compassion to to speak) and always tells me I'm beautiful so this is in MY head for sure and he is not judging me. 
* Timing - I think because of #1 and 2 I prefer late night rendevous. I like everything being done, tucked away, not worrying about kids or chores or dogs, or whatever. My husband is the opposite, claiming he's tired, ""not at his peak"" and it isn't fair that we're always on my clock. I find I cannot relax even a little (and I'm already NOT relaxed) if it's early in the day. 
* Enjoyment (for me) - IDK if it's age, hormones (which I've had checked and are fine), my mental state or being out of practice, but reaching climax is not easy. It's reached a point of frustration for me because of course, I'd like to be able to do that sometimes. Just pumping around isn't going to work and it seems my body needs a bit more of a combination off stuff. This is a problem because of my next bullet...
* OCD is in my marriage - My husband has developed scrupolicty over the recent years and it's a third party always in the room. Within the last year there was a time where I was able to climax while were together and I thought we had a good time. The next day he was in an OCD mood, I could tell, so I asked. He was concerned we had sinned because ""he"" didn't make me climax, it had happened as result of my involvement also and was akin to self pleasure. I felt so humilated because then I had to explain why that wasn't true -- we were in the marital act together and, like I said above, a combo of actions is needed. It wouldn't have happened without us working together so to speak. He eventually seemed satisfied with that answer but I've been anxious about it ever since.
* The things I think may work for me to ""get there"" could trigger the OCD. I don't know my body anymore. I don't know what works, but I think maybe more foreplay, oral sex (for me), toys (not to be used alone, only together) could also be possible options. I'm so afraid and embarassed to even try to mention these things because I just can't face the judgement. I don't want the discussions and the research and have to prove that I can be with my husband and not be sinning.

So here I am left feeling broken and frustrated and while I want intimacy with my husband it's also beginning to feel isolating and like a chore and I hate that. I know communication is the key,  but how? I'm so shy verbally about his and a letter just seems childish. There's also the OCD. There is no other force in this world I hate talking to because once that kicks in I'm not talking to my husband, I'm talking to IT begging it to let me through.

TLDR because whiney and ranty, sorry : Im due any day now, does my diet still affect the babys development? 

Im normally a healthy eater and love to eat, but pregnancy has been hard on the diet front. Terrible nausea and food aversion during 1st trimester which caused weight loss, somewhat back to normal during 2nd, but the nausea returned by the 3rd along with acid reflux and indigestion, and I never experienced any cravings. Never in my life I thought that eating would become a chore. 

Ive been forcing myself to eat certain things that i particularly dont enjoy for the time being. I normally love flavorful stuff, herbs spices, etc but they all now cause nausea, now I can only have bland stuff. On top of that, Ive been trying to reduce acid and indigestion which means extra boring food, and I just try to eat to meet the minimum recommended macros because Im afraid Ill otherwise cause harm to the baby. To make up for possible lack of nutrients, Im taking so many vitamins and supplements including protein powder, and often thats enough to make me full. All in all, meal times have been stressful. 

Ive now reached 37 weeks and everything is uncomfortable but Im so thankful that things are looking good so far. My weight gain as well as the babys growth is well within the recommended range. At this point, it seems like all the major fStal developments have already happened, and Im far from malnourished. So Im wondering if it would be ok for me to eat more carelessly now for the sake of my own digestive comfort. I feel extremely heavy and exhausted all the time and no amount of calories is helping. It feels like theres no more room left in my body for any food. The baby is very energetic and moves constantly which is both comforting, psychologically and uncomfortable, physically, but I see this as a sign that hes well fed? So can I stop worrying about nutrition at this point? Obviously Im not talking about consuming alcohol and ultra processed trans fat. I just want to eat simple carbs in small amounts and be protein deficient for now until my appetite and digestive system goes back to their pre-pregnancy condition.

I previously had cholestasis of pregnancy with my first pregnancy, and insulin-controlled gestational diabetes with both.

However, I started getting symptoms I didnt have with my first such as: more migraines, more frequent and severe heartburn that radiates to my back and around the bra line, extreme fatigue, intense Braxton Hicks, and back pain. I know these are similar to regular pregnancy symptoms, but theyre mainly concerning to me since I didnt have it with my first and its new to me. Thankfully I havent had much swelling, and my blood pressure is normal (so far). I ordered an at-home blood pressure monitor for peace of mind, but I know sometimes blood pressure doesnt always spike for those with pre-eclampsia.

What can expect for the future ? Am I imagining this ?

I must add that my mental health really took a turn for the worst this week.

We got married in December 2023. A month or so before the wedding I got off birth control and got pregnant right away. When I was around 7 weeks, my husband asked for a paternity test. It absolutely crushed me, I cried for hours and ended up bleeding. The pregnancy ended a few days later.

I had 4 chemicals after and got pregnant again in August 2024. That pregnancy ended in October 2024. The paternity test hasnt been discussed since and honestly I assumed he got over it considering me tracking each ovulation, making both of us go through many tests to figure out whats wrong, etc.

Long story short- I got pregnant again in November 2024 and am now almost 17 weeks. We had guests over a few weeks ago and I was discussing crazy pregnancy dreams and one of them was giving birth to a baby with a different skin color. Everyone laughed because the discussion was lighthearted but my husband suddenly said something like and then you wonder why I want to do the test. My jaw dropped and the other woman over got very defensive for me.

He brought up the subject again a few days ago and we got in a major fight. He says he doesnt think I cheated but that since this baby stuck, maybe I got inseminated behind his back as maybe his sperm didnt work. I offered to look at all medical records of mine and reminded him of being on a shit ton of medication to sustain this pregnancy.

He stands his ground and basically belittles me and any argument I have about this being hurtful. His main point is that he is a man and has no way of knowing the baby is his.

For context:
I work from home, literally never go out unless I have a female friend over. Never spend any nights away from home and take care of 3 dogs. I physically wouldnt have time to cheat nor have I ever considered doing that. My husband also works from home and has access to all my devices/location on my phone.

I dont know what kind of advice I am looking for. I have not forgiven him for asking for the first paternity test and am simply disgusted by his behavior. 

Edit:

I wanted to thank everyone for weighing in. So much food for thought, I am glad to know I am not overreacting. I already agreed to the test as long as it is done privately as I am deeply ashamed of having to go through it. I wont divorce my husband over this but I will do everything in my power to make him seek therapy that he goes to regularly and not a couple times like he used to.

On all the ultrasounds my doctor said how she's very active and since I started feeling her kicks (started quite late with me around 25 weeks), I can also tell that she's an active one.

But for the last ~36 hours she's completely silent. I felt like 1-2 really minor movements this morning, but other than that, nothing.

I know many babies have a growth spurt at 30 weeks and that can cause them to be move less. But as a mom I'm still worried, as it's so usual for her. I tried to get her to move, moved around myself and carefully massaged my belly to get a reaction from her, but so far nothing has helped.

Should I go to the hospital? Should I wait some more? I would be very thankful for some insight and advice on this =O

UPDATE: I had a CTG done and everything seems to be okay. Of course 5 minutes after starting the CTG, baby girl started kicking.

Over time I warmed up the idea and decided Id be okay with one baby. Husband wanted three, but was glad I was open to one. We got married and after a year of trying I got pregnant with my little girl who is due in June.

Now tell me why this man is watching me suffer and is already talking about a second baby??
We had discussed right before I got pregnant that I MIGHT do two, but we dont know what pregnancy and parenthood will be like and Im not rushing to make that decision before we see what life is like with a baby.

He keeps saying the baby needs a sibling and he really wants a boy and a girl. I thought on it and decided under certain conditions I could be open to one more, definitely not three.

My conditions: 
1. We must be comfortable with the political and economical climate at the time specifically in regard to womens rights and maternal rights.

2. After breast feeding husband pays for a breast lift and tummy tuck if needed.

3. He must be okay with stopping at 2 even if we have another daughter. By stopping at 2 I mean he will get a vasectomy.

Husband is willing to accept 1-2 and says even if its another girl hed gladly stop at 2 babies so she can have a sibling. 

However, he says he will not get a vasectomy. I explained in detail how its reversible and much safer than me getting my tubes tied. He insists we can continue to use condoms and plan B as needed. I told him currently in the USA they are working to ban birth control, abortion, and plan b and we will have no fall back if I get pregnant at 40 which we both agree we wouldnt want another kid at that age.

Is this unreasonable? He says he doesnt want to mess with his downstairs and I rolled my eyes and reminded him what Im doing to my body for us to have a child.

My husband has been kind and taken good care of me through this, but I feel Ive compromised a lot and met him half way on our ideals with what our family will be like. Is a vasectomy really asking too much??

Edit: Id like to point out as there seems to be some confusion. Id never force my husband to have a vasectomy. Its simply a condition if he wants a second child which is something he wants.

2025-03-15,1742042496.0,Husband keeps putting his phone on airplane mode,"Im 36 weeks pregnant and I live at home with my husband who has a difficult time sleeping. He often goes to sleep in the guest bedroom down the hall.

I dont mind typically, since I know he struggles with sleeping. However now that Im deep in the third trimester, I need him to be available. And often during the night&he isnt.

2 weeks ago, I had very bad pains for an hour that stopped me from being able to switch sides or even get out of bed. I felt like a beached whale. I tried calling him and texting him, but his phone was on do not disturb and he didnt add me as a person to get through to him when I needed to. After about 20 mins, I was able to get up and crouch my way over to the room down the hall where I angrily woke him up. Bc hes such a disturbed sleeper, he anxiously started yelling what what what! At the top of his lungs at me. I was really upset, bc I felt when I needed him around for our baby, he wasnt there. He was angry for about ten minutes that I woke him up and was grumbling about how I get to nap during the day and he doesnt, but I wasnt having any of it. Respectfully I told him to shut his mouth and do/say nothing unless its about being there for me. Im Puerto Rican and I dont play that . Turns out the baby dropped 2 centimeters!

A couple days later, Im up in the am and hes still sleeping in. My 2 40 pound dogs are on me and Im so big I cant get them off. I try calling him, since I made myself a do not disturb contact and wouldnt you know, he put on his airplane mode! So I couldnt reach him regardless. His excuse was well I went to the other room at 6 am and I figured you were up and youd be fine. Suffice it to say, I was NOT happy. I told him he cant do this, that he needs to be reachable at all times, even if Im just downstairs. 
What if I fall? What if Im in pain again and cant move? What if the dogs wont let me get up? I said if he did it again, there would be big problems.

Now today, same thing. This time, he slept in the other room all night and the dogs are crying to be walked and Im texting/calling him..his phone is off. Im trying to yell for him..but he isnt hearing me. He also planned on waking up this am to go for a quick shake out run since hes running a half marathon tmrw. His mother is landing from Minnesota in a half hour and hes not up. I made it clear that we need to turn over the guest room for her, and need to sweep downstairs. I cleaned pretty much the whole house in prep for her yesterday. Went to Costco to do my final prep run for freezer meal prep for us, so he doesnt lose his mind cooking meals and making a mess bc I wont be able to help much, AND went to his race expo with him to pick up his bib and help him navigate it. Its his first big formal race and Ive ran multiple halfs and a marathon. So wanted to show my support for him.

Why is she coming? Bc he needs to go to a work conference for a week in Utah and the only way Id let him go is if he made sure someone was with me. Bc Im always tired and always need some help.

Am I being a brat or unreasonable to want my husband to not put his need for sleep over making himself available to me in my last month of pregnancy?

Im just getting so annoyed that I have to keep having this convo with him and Im debating telling his mother. Although I dont know what that will do..she tends to coddle him lol. Ive done a lot of work to get him to be less coddled lol. Ive also done a lot of work to get myself to a point where I dont just pop off on him. Being a New Yorker and Latina, thats my instinct. But he doesnt respond well to that and says Im being disrespectful and wont engage with me.

Sorry for the rant everyone. Any advice? Am I being nuts? Thanks!

Update: I popped off on him via text and told him Im telling both of our parents he keeps doing this. He said sorry and that his phone gets put on airplane mode automatically and its just habit. Well it wasnt a habit when he had it on do not disturb and we got into a fight over that right? Now that I can reach him through DND, now its a years long habit lol. I just told him that the fact that he didnt make it a priority to be cognizant of before bed shows how careless and selfish hes being.

I snagged the MomCozy (Amazon) one on sale. They're probably the best brand I know of that's super fluffy. the only downside is the color selection is trash. I ended up with a boring grey because it was cheaper. 

**Good tips:**

 If you have a cosleeping toddler, get them one too = or you'll end up like me having to share with a tiny Snorlax *(thankfully I'm not big enough yet that it's an issue lol - hopefully I can get him his own soon lol)*

*Shape:* Everyone is different but I toss and turn like a gas station hotdog in my sleep so the U shaped one that is curved at the bottom was the best option for me. 

*Size:* I also got the 57inch one, I'm under 5ft (152) and it's like a nest (which I prefer). But my husband who is 5ft9 (179cm) is comfortable in it too so it's versatile for a variety of heights.

*Cheaper options:* Honestly if you get a cheaper one and it's not fluffy enough you can also use old pillows to stuff it more or get a bag polyfil)",pregnant,18.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jbljxd/just_get_the_pregnancy_pillow/

This is my 3rd pregnancy, but my other 2 pregnancies with my ex husband years ago&. I was in a bad marriage. I didnt enjoy being with him sexually and usually just used pregnancy as an excuse to NOT have sex for several months. 
 
However, NOW fast forward, my husband and I are expecting a baby together and we are deeply in love. We enjoy sex &amp; intimacy and want it. 
However we have always been missionary &amp; doggy people. I am 17 weeks now and neither of those are on the table. Ive heard doggy works for some, but Ive personally found it very uncomfortable the further into pregnancy Ive gotten&.. 
 
We havent had sex in like 2 weeks now because honestly we dont know how were going to do it. 
Weve never tried sex while lying on our sides. I can say Ive done it with an ex partner ages ago, and was successful. But Id also tried it in other relationships and not been so successful.

2025-03-15,1742042479.0,Unexpected pregnancy,"I (31F) just found out I am pregnant completely unexpectedly with my bf (38M) and I dont know what to do. We love eachother but weve only been together 1.5yrs and dont even live together yet. Weve talked about kids in vague terms as something we could possibly both see for ourselves if our relationship continues as it has been (maybe in the next 3 years kinda thing). Cut to yesterday, when Im peeing into a cup after what turns out to have been days of implantation cramps. Ive been on the pill for over half my life, so it was a total shock when I saw a positive result yesterday.

Although Weve both expressed there are a lot of things we would prefer to have happened before this step, my bf is supportive of my choice no matter what, and will rise to the occasion if I decide to continue the pregnancy.

We both have good jobs, we make good money in volatile albeit hot industries. My bf is new in his role, has some debt and has far less savings and security than me. I know people make it work with far less than us, but I dont necessarily feel like that means we should rush into this. 

Having kids has always been a well see thing, at the back of my mind, because Ive prioritized career stuff until now. I thought that Id eventually go off the pill and see what happens when I felt ready. Ive prepared myself for a future where its too late or not in the cards. But I never prepared myself for jumping right to the getting pregnant part. On one hand, I dont know if Im ready for my life to completely change. But another part of me is thinking& even though it wasnt the plan, maybe this is my time? Im terrified of making the wrong decision.

I went from 230lb down to 170lb over a year and a half. It was slow and steady, clean eating and being active. Part of the reason I wanted to lose weight was bc I wanted to be able to see my baby bump sooner after conceiving.

I thought having the healthy habits already established would help me eat well and stay active during pregnancy. 


Wrong. Im 14 weeks now. At my 10 week appt I had already gained 20lbs. 20 fucking lbs in 10 weeks. Idk where Im at now, Im scared to check. Im huge. My stomach is huge. None of my clothes fit. I cant keep googling weight gain during pregnancy bc all I see is the literature saying youre only supposed to gain 1 - 5 lbs in the first trimester. I see all the articles about how Im hurting my baby by gaining weight too quickly, that Im going to get GD and my baby is going to be too big and Im risking pre term birth or making it more likely that Ill need a c section. Idk how to slow the weight gain down without straight up restricting, and Im terrified to restrict bc I dont want to hurt baby

They are asking for sugar levels to be below 5mmols pre meals and below 7mmols post meals. Im getting more and more depressed. Nowadays my sugar is all over the place despite watching my diet and insulin. After having an apple for breakfast would increase my sugar to over 10mmols, just one apple!!

I barely slept last night bc of the gastric reflux and the impossible task of finding a comfortable position. Im still eating enough but its gotten to the point where Ive almost developed a fear of food. I dont know if its my organs shifting around or what, but lately things just hurt and burn (or maybe Im just hungry I dont know.) I find myself wondering if food will just make me feel worse, or sometimes its more like apathy, like Im just so tired of needing to eat so often. But then the stomach acid gets worse if I have an empty stomach, sometimes it wakes me up at night and I have to eat a bowl of cereal. I have woken up to myself choking on my own vomit/stomach acid more than once, despite sleeping popped up on pillows. I didnt know whether to label this post as a rant or seeking advice. I feel like the only thing that will help at this point is giving birth. I wish I could fast forward to the end. I try to remind myself at least I dont have other symptoms like sciatica (yet) or GD. I dont know. Im exhausted every day even though I dont really accomplish anything. Doing a load of laundry is a big task these days. I literally do not even remember what it feels like to feel normal, kindof like when youve had a cold for weeks and you cant even remember what it feels like to breathe through your nose (which funnily enough, Ive also had constant rhinitis since October.)

Maybe this is just a rant. I alternate between tums, gasx, Pepcid, etc its like Ive tried everything and it only kindof helps. Maybe Ill ask my OB for a refill of reglan bc it feels like food just sits and rots in me and doesnt move along like its supposed to. Pregnancy is just so sucky and hard and honestly lonely. I dont have any pregnant friends and my mom and MIL and husband are all supportive but its like idk what can anyone say? I hate how my mom hasnt been pregnant in decades and has clearly forgotten (or maybe really never experienced) how truly awful it is.

2025-03-15,1742034035.0,"I want to improve relationship with my mom, but I cant stand her","Im 26 weeks pregnant and my mom insists on staying at my house during postpartum to take care of me, but she hasnt cared much for me during pregnancy and I seriously cannot stand her, even though I love her very much.

Until now, she has come to visit me once, never texted or asked me about my conditions, said she would visit us but cancelled last minute twice. 

Today is my parents wedding anniversary, she told us to come for dinner but I said we would come over for lunch because I have other things. I came and she said she didnt know I would not be staying for dinner. I told her I had work that I cant miss, Ive been very stressed out about work that I woke up at 2am and cant fall back to sleep for several nights already. I was exhausted, the house was small there is no room for me to rest, so while my parents took afternoon nap in their room, I had to lay on the floor in the living room. I ended up leaving around 3pm because I didnt want to torture myself.

My husband and I are very private person, we dont like having other people in our house so we purposefully only built two rooms, one for home office and the other our bedroom. When my mom told me she would come over to stay, I told her we didnt have a room, and she said why built such a badly designed house. She wanted me to do postpartum confinement for at least 2 weeks without touching water (meaning no shower), and I said no. The argue only ended with my dads intervention telling my mom her way was very old-fashioned and not suitable anymore. I told her Ill let her know if I needed help, but Im not making any arrangements for now.

The thing is, I know my mom cares and her love language is food, but she talks too loudly and too much, and her obsession with food drives me nuts. Whenever I talked to her about other things, she brushed them off. I had so much childhood trauma with my mom I cant bring myself to be open with her anymore.

When I was a kid, I told my mom my hair was falling out but she didnt care until I was almost bald. She laughed at my handmade gift to her and told me it was ugly. In uni I asked her to bring home (southeast asia) some pottery and glass I made and treasured very much, she left them at my cousins house in the US. When I asked to move out because I didnt feel comfortable living together, she threatened to cut ties because she was afraid of what others might say. She never said sorry to me once. Honestly, I dont think my feelings matter much to her. Shes controlling, and loves my brother because he would listen to her demands all the time. I have stopped telling her anything going on with me because she would brush them off, telling me we earn a lot of money so those are not really problems.

Im afraid my relationship with my mom will affect the relationship with my child, and I really want to have a loving, open relationship with my mom. I know its two-way, Im also part of the problem as Im too independent and like spending time alone. I feel more at ease to be with my cats than with my mom because I dont have to talk or entertain them. I know my mom will be a great help once baby comes, but I cant bring myself to ask her anything. Im afraid Id be too annoyed at her and make myself even more tired.

FTM(31) here, 19 + 6. I had my regular prenatal appointment the other day, and one thing my doctor mentioned really stuck with me. She said its super important to stay active and keep my muscles in shape for the delivery. I didnt think much of it at the time, but now I'm starting to wonder what exactly she meant.

I've been going to the gym religiously (5 days a week for 1.5-2 hours) for the past 2-3 years. But since getting pregnant, I stopped going due to extreme fatigue in the first trimester. 
Now that Im starting to get my energy back, Im really struggling. Im almost always short of breath (just by existing) and cant even last 15 minutes on the stairmaster (level 6) without wheezing. 

I used to love lifting, but I cant even lift half the weight I used to pre-pregnancy. Honestly, even walking around the neighborhood feels exhausting.

What my doctor said really got me thinking and has me a bit worried, to be honest. Im wondering if anyone here can help me understand what she meant by keeping muscles in shape for delivery.

Is she referring to a specific muscle group? Or is it more about cardio? Im just feeling a bit lost on this one.

2025-03-15,1742007283.0,35 weeks. Need advice. What do I do after a non-fault car accident leaves our family with no income?,"Hello. I am located in SC, United States. Throwaway due to us still being in legal proceedings with the Car accident. I am currently 35 weeks pregnant with our first, and I am high risk. My husband got into a car crash last week that has left him with a broken leg in two spots. The car was totaled, and the other party was cited as 100% at fault. We have no idea how he is alive but I am unbelievably amazed that he is. His recovery is looking like 4-6 weeks, with no surgery. This will be confirmed at various follow ups so unfortunately until he heals, I do not have an exact timeframe. I am grateful that this does not currently look like a long term injury.

We have done the correct things regarding the accident, such as reaching out to our insurance, the other driver's insurance, and a family friend's recommended personal injury lawyer. I am following the advice of my lawyer regarding the car accident, but I am looking for advice regarding how to pay our bills in the meantime. Due to the nature of his injury, this is looking like it will be a relatively long settlement period while he recovers. We expect a reasonable amount at the end of this.

At this time, we have one remaining vehicle that is paid off and are not worried about getting a second anytime soon. The car involved in the accident was in my father's name and he will be receiving the car settlement, not us. The injury settlement will be what I am going to receive at the end of this. We live paycheck to paycheck and due to my high risk pregnancy, I am currently off work. Prior to the accident, at the end of our bills we have $80 for gas, and my father/WIC are covering our groceries. My husband barely makes just enough for us not to be eligible for food stamps. I do not have any disability pay or paid maternity leave. My husband just started a new job two months ago and is not eligible for disability or paid leave. Following the accident, my husband is unable to complete training at this time and is going to be placed on unpaid administrative leave until he is cleared by his doctors to continue training. I understand that in the settlement this will all be paid for due to the lost wages, but in the meantime, we are trying to not have our house foreclosed or our lights turned off, or bills go to collections. I have tried applying for a personal loan and we were denied due to lack of income. He has two small credit cards, and I have one small credit card (total credit borrowed less than $2,000). They are all at about 90% of max. We were denied for all credit increases due to paying the minimum amount and not more. We have been denied opening new lines of credit due to lack of income at this time. We are as prepared as we can be for the baby, and I plan to return to work as soon as I am able.

We do not have any friends or family with the funds to pay our mortgage and bills in the meantime while we wait for the settlement money.  Our church paid our mortgage and electric bill in January when I was put on unpaid maternity leave. I am trying to reach out to other churches and associations in our area but unfortunately most of the population is struggling in this economy and there's only so much money to go around. We have filed a deferment for the mortgage but it is not looking like they will give us more than a month. We already did a loan modification in January which was screwed over by an increase in escrow anyway. We are not eligible for another modification anytime soon. Our monthly expenses are not that high. Total is less than $3,500 a month for mortgage, bills, and utilities.

At this point, I feel like my only option is go fund me and pray. Our community has been wonderful, neighbors and friends helping me with chores, etc. so it's really just figuring out how to pay our bills in the meantime.

Can anyone please give me advice on how to proceed? Is there an option I'm missing? To reiterate, I am not asking anyone here for money, just advice. I'm terrified of being foreclosed on with a newborn because of this car accident.",pregnant,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jbllja/35_weeks_need_advice_what_do_i_do_after_a/

I think I am 4 weeks along after checking a few calculators online (first day of last period was Feb 10).  The symptoms I noticed about a week ago was sore boobs which only seem to be getting worse, and some tiredness here and there. Yesterday though, an hour after I ate my lunch, I got a sudden bout of nausea and thought I was going to vomit immediately. It came out of nowhere and honestly scared me and my body went into a flight/fight reaction, where suddenly I felt sick all over and thankfully didn't puke but I had to poop a few times and felt nauseous for many hours.  I also felt lightheaded the majority of the day but I assume it's because I didn't eat nearly as much as I normally would and I expelled everything out the other end lol.

I eventually got hungry again, about 5 hours later, and ate a handful of walnuts which made my stomach hurt.  Then about 2 hours after that I had a quesadilla and fiesta potatoes from Taco Bell which went down well, but I got a slight tummy ache again and just felt ""bleh"" and lethargic.  Woke up today feeling much better but had another bathroom trip which was rather unpleasant.

I do have IBS and have always had issues here and there with my stomach. I of course always worried that I would be absolutely terrible when pregnant and now I'm freaking out a bit because it's SO early in the pregnancy that I shouldn't be nauseous from it already...

Currently 12+4 with our < post IVF loss at 12+5 March of last year. As you can imagine Im struggling mentally and emotionally as the sense of loss never really goes away but of course grateful for this spontaneous pregnancy after TTC for 4yrs.

Starting Monday this week my nausea has essentially disappeared, breasts tender but not near as sore as they have consistently been. Im tired, and feel more bloated than normal. But feel like Im functioning more than I have been in the last three months. My nausea has kept me out of work several days in the last few weeks so the almost sudden absence is really sending me for a loop. 

Last year my symptoms also disappeared the 12th week and we found out at our appt at 12+5 wed had a silent miscarriage around the 11 week mark. There was a reason for the MC and this year our 8wk appt everything looked great. So Im of course just spinning at this point. Need to make it through the weekend on my own as hubby is visiting family and Im visiting mine, opposite directions. Monday is our NT scan.

I (32 female 39 weeks and 5 days pregnant) had everything, literally everything, I could think of done, cleaned, prepped and figured out. So of course the day prior my fiancé comes down with an illness. Mind you I've been extremely hyper vigilant on avoiding any illnesses this entire pregnancy. I wear disposable gloves and use Lysol wipes at the grocery store, avoid crowded events and stay away from people who are experiencing any symptoms. 

Yesterday morning my fiancé woke me up to tell me he was ill so I had him take a 3 panel at home test for COVID19 and flu A&amp;B. Everything came back negative. I noticed that my throat was starting to feel sore as well so I called the labor&amp;delivery department where my csection was scheduled as well as my obgyn. They both said to just come regardless and even though my fiancé is sick with fever, chills, head/body aches, congestion and runny nose he could still come too. Of course we would need to take proper precautions though. 

I continued to finish my preparations last night with the hope that this was just the RSV, that I'm vaccinated from, currently going around but still i woke up this morning with extreme anxiety. Looking at my s.o. hardly able to stand I asked him to take another test. He did and tested positive for flu A. Mind you my fiancé isn't the greatest at self awareness. He has been constantly coughing into his hands and touching everything. The pets, grabbing silverware, light switches, door knobs and cabinets. I'm trying to stay as calm as possible repeatedly disinfecting things behind him and kindly suggesting that he frequently washes his hands, coughs into his shirt and avoids touching everything. 

I felt like my fate had already been sealed and I was about to have a C-section then come down with the flu with a newborn and have no one to help with the baby and C-section recovery. My fiancé is like the typical manly man that gets taken out by illnesses. Nothing against him but I know I wouldn't be able to rely on him to safely take care of the baby while avoiding transmission. So I called labor/delivery and they said they'd have my obgyn call me. He never did so I prepared to go in anyway and once I got there they had him on the phone and he said let's just go ahead and reschedule.

I was initially at first relieved because I can't handle the thought of doing all of this alone while sick. The thought of a newborn with the flu feels like a nightmare. Now I'm reading that pregnancy with the flu can cause still births. I am just so torn because my only concern is our baby and I worry if I made the wrong choice. I'm not sure exactly what I'm asking for on here. Maybe some shared experiences and advice. I wouldn't be able to live with myself if anything happened to my baby girl. My anxiety has been dragging me all over the place. Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read and respond to this.

I can strech and it'll relieve the symptoms for a little while, but it comes right back within an hour. Sleeping propped up at a 45 degree angle helps, but I think that's only because it keeps the little one from being pushed into my chest as hard and squishing my organs when the muscles tighten.

A week ago I did go into preterm labor for about 4 hours. Luckily it stopped on its own before any big problems occurred, but my ob did say that I am not 1 cm dilated and about 50% effaced. The little one did drop into my pelvis and had a lot of pressure for about a day and a half until they came back up on their own. I do have medication available to me now to stop contractions if this happens again for the next 2 weeks where it'll be ok if I go into early labor.

I don't know if this has something to do with the early labor or just normal growing pains or what's going on. Just know that suddenly no matter what I do I can't keep my muscles from feeling like they're slowly strangling my insides. Fetal movement is good, lots of strong kicks like always. Honestly a bit too strong since I've got 3 bruised ribs.. and doc says heartbeat sounds strong and normal rhythm.

But ya, if anyone has any clues or advise on how to get the muscles to stop being a pain.. everywhere.. I'd appreciate t!",pregnant,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jc0onc/abdominal_paintension/
2025-03-15,1742013555.0,22(f) just found out Im pregnant after bf cheated,"I (22f) just found out my Christian boyfriend was cheating on me WITH TINDER GIRLS for about a month. As far as I know it was emotional cheating only but probably lots of sexting, etc. Anyways I broke up with him immediately after and that was two weeks ago. For more context, I went off the pill in July and have been extremely irregular since then, so I thought I was likely infertile until my cycle went pack to normal. Regardless, we had been extremely careful. We used condoms every single time except LITERALLY ONCE. This was back in December. I took a pregnancy test today because I have been abnormally bloated recently and thought I should to be safe. It was positive. I have had basically no other symptoms which is wild because I now am at around 3.5 months. Obviously I am freaking out. I have always been pro choice but anti abortion if that makes sense. However I am not in a situation (life or financial) where I am ready to be a single parent, and I believe that is what would happen if I went through with this. It is crazy to me that some people try for years that want a baby and some people get pregnant by a one time fluke. Life is cruel sometimes. Anyways, any words of wisdom  or encouragement would be appreciated. This is a very scary situation.

I feel so guilty that Im not my usual energetic self for my 18 month old :( Typically we go to the park or a walk down to the beach to play in the sand daily, but lately I have had zero energy to do anything besides keeping her fed and changed. We have been watching a lot of movies and Bluey. I feel like the worst mom for not being active for her right now. I struggle with extreme nausea and vomiting during pregnancy so Im often hunched over the toilet while she plays in the living room.

2025-03-15,1742054331.0,Kind of a rant,"I feel so emotionally and physically exhausted. Im only 18 weeks pregnant and Im not sure how others do it. Im a NICU RN and having seen coworkers work up until their due date amazes me. I worked almost 40 hours the last three days and Im off today feeling so exhausted. I just wanna lay in bed all day and just vegetate and cry. But I also wanna be able to have the energy to go out and spend time with my boyfriend and friends. My boyfriend went to play basketball with our friends this morning and just texted me to get ready so we can all go out to eat breakfast together. I started crying cause I just feel so exhausted but I do wanna go. 

And only being off today knowing I go back to work the next two just makes me not wanna do anything even more. Some days days at work arent too bad but when I worked this past Wednesday and had such a chaotic shift (dont get to eat much at all that day or go to the bathroom until 10 hours into my shift), it just took all my energy away and the next two shift werent bad but I just felt tired all day. 

I know every pregnancy is different but idk how people do it. Working, being pregnant, keeping up with house chores, etc. I dont mean to sound whiny but Im just so exhausted both mentally and physically right now. 

This is also my first pregnancy and I just feel so scared that something bad is going to happen even though the pregnancy has been healthy so far. Theres no reason for me to worry but I just cant help but not get my hopes up just in case something does happen. 

Sorry for the rant, just felt like getting this off my chest at the moment ",pregnant,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jby9im/kind_of_a_rant/
2025-03-15,1742063026.0,"Only sac is visible, when should my next ultrasound be?","Hello! This is my first pregnancy ever and l'm figuring out what to do next. According to my first day of my last period (24 January) l'm officially 7 weeks and 1 day.

Last week on tuesday l went for an ultrasound and they could only see the sac, no yolk or embryo. The doctor said that l can come back 2-3 weeks later. (This was done at a private hospital)

The last few days l got very sick (like a nasty cold) so l went to the urgent care this evening and they did an ultrasound and they could also only see the sac, nothing else. (This was done at the government hospital and the equipment looked a bit older l guess ?)

However, should l be worried? l do have the typical symptons (no vomiting though) and l think my ovultion might have been very late.

When is the best time to go for the next ultrasound? lm scared that if l go too early l will be disappointed again but l also find it difficult to wait for a while.

Both times were done by external ultrasound and didnt experience any spotting, etc.",pregnant,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jc1kd8/only_sac_is_visible_when_should_my_next/
2025-03-15,1742053673.0,"Single Income Home, Pregnant Breadwinner","I feel like my situation is really unique or maybe people just dont talk about it. Idk? 

Im near the end of my pregnancy and my husband and I have decided that hell be the stay at home dad and Ill be the breadwinner for this phase of our lives. Hes had health issues which have mostly resolved and he might finish up his degree at night. 

His personality is better suited to staying at home and providing childcare, while I get really restless at home and honestly have a lot of anxiety and trauma surrounding the thought of being a stay at home parent. I work from home now which I love and we have a really great and healthy relationship. Hes super supportive and eager to be an involved stay at home dad, and feels like it would personally be more fulfilling to him than a corporate job.

We feel really confident that this is what will work best for us. Weve grown up around a lot of single income families but usually its with more traditional gender roles (dad as the breadwinner). Were from the US and were raised very religious but are now atheist. 

Im currently debating how to split up my 3 weeks PTO and 60% Paid Short term disability pay since that will be all thats available to us. 

I guess my question is, are we normal? Is it possible in the US to live this life? Has anyone gone through a similar situation?

2025-03-14,1741989280.0,Im losing my mind,"This past week has been a nightmare. First day of LMP was 1/8, I have PCOS so I may have missed a cycle. Got a positive digital on Saturday 3/8. For a few days prior and after I was having light spotting. Some light pink but mostly light brown with very dark brown thick, stringy, bouncy clots occasionally. Called OB, nurse said to go the ER. ER detected no intrauterine pregnancy with an HCG in the 200s. Also detected 3.6cm cyst on left ovary. They diagnosed me with a miscarriage.

Cut to calling the nurse to let her know the diagnosis and schedule a follow up. I had my follow up yesterday on 3/12. They gave me an ultrasound and again, no signs of intrauterine pregnancy. Cyst had shrunk slightly to 3.2cm. They took my blood again and I got the results today.

HCG is now 513. Completely baffled by this, I call the OB and speak with the nurse. She says she suspects that I am still pregnant just very early and thats why nothing is showing on US.

I am so confused. I was pregnant, not pregnant and pregnant again within 6 days. I had already started grieving the loss. Now Im in a state of depressive shock until I know for sure. They scheduled me for another US on 3/31. I cant wait that long. I need to know. Something doesnt feel right. I have symptoms, breast tenderness, heartburn when lying down. But there is this emptiness in my uterus but also feels tight with little bubbles. Almost exactly the feeling right before a period floods. I started spotting again today, but this time it was bright red on the tp only when I wiped. Now back to brown again. Please give me any experiences or thoughts. I feel as though I am going to go insane.",pregnant,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jbfgtb/im_losing_my_mind/
2025-03-15,1742049111.0,"I am not talking about button-up shirts a size larger, but specifically button-up shirts that have that 'oversized' style. Would they work instead of maternity shirts which look like tents?","Just for extra clarification, I'm thinking of going not only a size up in work shirt, but it is a shirt that is specifically 'oversized' (as opposed to 'fitted' or 'normal').

I have already read several posts in this subreddit about going a size up in clothing not really being suitable, but nothing really talks about the 'oversize' style.

I am asking because I have seen pregnancy work shirts and they either look great, but are hyper expensive and I'll only wear them for a few weeks at the end of the pregnancy, or they're more inexpensive but look terrible, like  big drapey tents.

Before I even took the test, I remember telling my husband that I felt like I had a tape worm in my stomach because I was so abnormally hungry. Additionally, the fatigue has me already needing naps on my lunch break. My stomach looks bigger as well. And the worst has been the NONSTOP CONGESTION. I read this is more normal later in the pregnancy, but Ive had it for the last week and a half and I am going crazy not being able to breathe. I have tried everything (humidifier, nasal strips, nasal spray when I didnt know, saline spray after I read more, hot compress, elevated sleeping).

Im losing my f$ckin mind. Its tough being too early to tell anyone and just suffering in silence. I am terrified for the rest of it!

More of a vent, but would love to hear if anyones congestion got better and didnt just stick around for the whole duration&

It has really made me worry a lot. I feel so terrible for her she has 4 children already but has had a few miscarriages before, she is dealing with it really well considering, bless her soul. Its just made me concerned for the wellbeing of this baby, I have an appointment on Wednesday with the GP but will not have a scan until a few weeks from now. I am constantly nauseous I mean 24/7 if Im not nauseous I am asleep. I feel genuinely exhausted all day I can barely get up, my whole back hurts constantly. It feels truly debilitating, on top of that I am getting heart palpitations throughout the day, I really cant stand throwing up so I try hold it in but sometimes I cant, every smell makes me feel sick and I feel like I have super senses now and can smell every single particle in the air.  My partner is really supportive but he just doesnt have the perspective and I feel like Im being naggy and complaining constantly but its how I feel all the time.

I have recently lost my mother too who was like the pregnancy guru she had 6 daughters and 20 grandchildren and was present for almost every birth. I havent mentioned my pregnancy to my sisters because I found out so close to my sister miscarrying I dont want to bring it up for at least a few weeks

Ive marked this as a rant but feel free if you have any advice for me other than ginger biscuits haha
