""We get it elective abortions are wrong and icky but rape"" 

We need to hammer it home that elective reasons for abortion are just as important 

I can't help but feel we fall into the forced birther trap when we go ""but rape""

Because in the eyes of the forced birther it seems like a concession that elective abortions are wrong 

Not to mention we know forced birthers don't give a fuck about women 

They constantly dehumanize the pregnant woman in every argument they make

Trying to appeal to their emotions won't work since they don't even consider the pregnant woman an important aspect of this discussion 

Sure some may say the quiet part out loud, but if you have debated a forced birther you know the gaslighting very well

""I do care about women"" and then they go on and dehumanize the pregnant woman 

Rape is something we can certainly bring up because that's a cold hard reality of these laws because they benefit rapists and cause suffering for the victim

But our pro abortion arguments shouldn't just hinge on rape

Elective reasons are just as important and that should be addressed in our arguments as well ","prochoice",23,"https://www.reddit.com/r/prochoice/comments/1jb6gq2/we_need_to_stop_bringing_up_the_rape_argument/"

I don't see any exemptions for rape, incest, or the life of the pregnant person. I don't see a clarification that ONLY funds used for abortion will be withdrawn. I only see that money provided by the General Assembly will be revoked to healthcare providers (other than hospitals) that provide or induce abortions.

I had my consultation and had a medical abortion as I was about to take the tablet I stared at it for half an hour Knowing I didnt want to do it but I was scared of what my boyfriend would say so I forced it down my throat and when I started to lose the baby I regretted everything, a few months have gone by now and I still regret it while I was still bleeding I found out my boyfriend had the time had been cheating on me and now he has been out of my life for a while I feel so stupid and naive and I just want to go back in time, I feel like no one understands I know it was probably for the best Im young but that wasnt my choice I wish I was true to myself and I miss my baby so much It hurts I have this pain that never goes away I remember how much love I had for my baby and the plans I had to give them the best life I could and then I remember the pain the night I decided to do it and all the things my ex said to me haunting me, has anyone had a similar experience how did you get past It?

I feel so stupid for having this happen again. my boyfriend and i have 4 kids. aged 6, 4 (twins) and 2& the first time i had literally just given birth my baby was only 2 months. being pregnant again wasnt good for not only my body but lifes circumstances& it didnt make sense and i had to do what was best. 
the second time , my boyfriend was swearing up and down he was pulling out but then admitted after ive already found out im pregnant that he purposely stayed in& i couldve easily gotten a plan b and that experience was really hard for me because i didnt feel like i had a valid reason as to why i shouldnt keep the baby besides not being ready financially, not wanting to add a 5th child to my already 4,  it not making sense to have an abortion just to get pregnant again and keep the baby without lifes circumstances changing& but i was attached to the baby and i broke down completely having to get an abortion it broke me so badly and i never wanted to go through it again&
birth control doesnt agree with my body im already anemic and i bleed the entire time. otherwise id definitely be on something& 
my boyfriend doesnt like condoms , so i try to hold out as long as i can on sex and track ovulation days but im still here once again&  i want my baby , thats what sucks& i was just telling my boyfriend that i couldnt wait to finish nursing school, i couldnt wait until he gets where he wants to be in his career, because id like to have a final baby in a few years& i just cant do it right now and i hate myself for it. i really wish i could keep my baby. i really do& but i dont wanna be pregnant until we repair our credit, were both deep into our careers and financially secure, weve got the big house for our kids& if i cant be pregnant without stress, not having to worry about anything but my next craving , then i dont think its best& someone please give me beautiful words. im broken right now. 

i had my abortion today. they asked if id like to see the ultrasound, i said no. they asked if id like to know if they saw multiples, i said no. immediately after the ultrasound i got a mychart notification but i didnt look&
i felt okay after the abortion. i still felt like it was the best decision for right now&. i prayed and prayed and asked god that if i was making a mistake to put something in the way , but everything went so smoothly, so easily& 
i looked at that ultrasound test result when i got home. it was twins& i immediately broke down , ive never felt like a bad person, but i dont feel like i deserve to be here anymore. i shouldnt have said i wouldnt wanna know , but i didnt think that would be the case. i have been crying almost an hour. i cant take back what ive done. i dont deserve to be here i dont deserve to eat or breathe. i keep asking myself what have i done, i aborted twins = i dont think ill ever be okay","abortion",28,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jaohbd/it_was_twins_what_have_i_done/"

I discovered I was pregnant on Feb 26th; I'd had what I thought was a light period on January 29th-30th-31st, but it turns out that must have been implantation bleeding. I thought I was only 10 days late for my period based on the timing of that bleed, but it turns out I was much further along. I hadn't had many symptoms except for very sore breasts, some tiredness and loss of appetite, all of which I tend to get before my cycle anyway, so I didn't clue in right away.

I'm in a solid, loving relationship, but we just aren't currently in a situation to add to our family. I have a young child from my previous relationship, and we live in a fairly modest apartment, and for many other reasons it just wouldn't be right to add to the family right now. 

I was a bit panicked when I found out I was pregnant, but my partner was incredibly supportive and understanding. I called my doctor the same day and was referred to our local hospital which has a program for women seeking termination. My partner brought me to the appointment, which was on Wednesday of this week. I'm based in Canada and so it was a very calm and non-judgmental environment; I'm grateful to the doctor and nurse who walked me through my options and explained everything to me.

I was given an ultrasound and blood test the same day and they determined I was at exactly 10 weeks and 0 days, the cutoff for using medical termination in my province. They mentioned I could either schedule a surgical termination for the following week, or do the medical termination as long as I was willing to take the first pill that day. I decided on the medical because I wanted to end the pregnancy as soon as possible - my last pregnancy and birth process were extremely traumatic, and being pregnant again was giving me nightmares and flashbacks, so I couldn't handle the thought of waiting any longer.

Timeline:

6:00 pm Wednesday: took the mifepristone dose as directed. Had some very mild cramping starting about two hours later, which continued the following day.

1:00 pm Thursday: developed a headache, had some additional cramping and mildly upset stomach through the rest of the afternoon.

6:00 pm: took 10 mg ketorolac with a small amount of food.

6:45 pm: took 4 Misoprostol tablets in the cheek for 30 minutes as directed, washed down with water afterwards.

9:00 pm: started having some mild cramping which came in waves, slight chills. Very mild nausea which didn't last. Watched TV with partner and just tried to relax.

10:00 pm: started having some light spotting, cramps continuing. Cramps felt like my worst period day, nothing too major. Chills and started to have diarrhea.

10:45 pm: listened to an audiobook and went to sleep.

11:30 pm: woke up to a strange sensation, felt almost like my hands weren't attached to my body. Felt something shift in my lower abdomen, then a rush of fluid. Fortunately I was wearing heavy duty period undies in addition to a pad already and had no leakage. Went to the bathroom expecting pure blood but discovered it was pink tinted fluid which I assume was water breaking. Pad completely saturated. Pain very minimal.

As soon as I sat down on the toilet I felt something drop out. Had the sensation of needing to push, did so and a much larger clump came rushing out, along with quite a bit of blood. Peeked into the toilet and could see a ring shaped clot, and noticed a light pink thing partially submerged in the blood. It was not pleasant to see and I could tell it was part of a leg/lower torso of the embryo, extremely small but unmistakable.

Had a bit of a cry. Said I was sorry. Remembered what some of the other women have said on here about their babies becoming part of the water. I did not want to be pregnant, but I couldn't help but have feelings about it. I stayed for a while before saying goodbye and flushing.

1:30 am: woke up again, mild cramping and passed some more clots. Took a second ketorolac. Came back to bed and fell asleep easily.

6:00 am: woke up at my normal time, immediately felt different than I'd been feeling for the last few weeks. Breasts still a little sore but pain noticeably reduced from how they had been feeling prior. Did not have the morning upset stomach, and was able to enjoy a coffee (I'd been having aversion to it for about three weeks). Actually had energy as opposed to feeling extremely fatigued. Had moderate amount of blood on the pad and a few tiny clots when going to the bathroom, similar to a day 2 period.

10:30 am (present): cramps have almost completely subsided, have not needed more ketorolac. Ate some breakfast. Still have what is similar to a day 2 period. Energy is much higher than it normally is at this time of the morning.

I will still need to monitor for unusual bleeding, signs of infection, or increasing pain, and will need a follow up to confirm everything has passed, but ultimately the process was not what I expected. I originally worried that 4 Misoprostol wouldn't be sufficient, given that I was 10 weeks along and I've seen stories on here of women needing double the dose. I was worried it wasn't working initially as it took quite some time for the bleeding to start.

For anyone facing this situation right now: just know that you aren't alone. You are doing what is best for your body, and if you aren't ready to give up everything for a baby it means you're doing the right thing for your baby too. Sending healing thoughts and wishes to all of you who are reading this and feeling scared - you can do this if you need to.","abortion",3,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jb5i23/positive_ma_experience_10w_0d/"
"2025-03-14",1741960126,"Abortion Anniversary","I was just wondering what people do to commemorate their abortion anniversary if you do anything at all?  My ex and I chose a spot and put a stone angel in a lake along with letters that we both wrote.  My abortion was in 2020 and we did that the year after, Ive been attempting to visit the spot 1x a year since then.  This will be my first anniversary that my ex and I are split up, but I still want to keep going at least once a year.  I think it may even be better to go without him - last year we didnt make it there and the year before I felt like he was annoyed to be there with me.  I think he was just emotionally over the abortion and didnt care to honor it anymore which is fine but Im just not there.  Even though I am not going to have children I still feel connected to the soul that him and I created and hope to meet them in some form.  My abortion is a big part of me and it may always be, which I accept (it took me a long time to come to terms with that).  Ill see how it goes this year, but I think Ill go up to the town with the lake, stop at my favorite restaurant up there, hit the lake, and then stop at one of my favorite stores which also happens to be in that town.  Im scared that Ill be sad without him, but my heart wants to go so Im going to try.  I feel like Im spiritually connected to my ex because of this experience, which is a different conversation and another post for another time lol.

"2025-03-13",1741908477,"PH to BKK Experience (Klongtun Hospital)","Hello everyone! I just wanted to share my experience getting an MVA (Manual Vacuum Aspiration) from Klongtun Hospital in Thailand. 


So on February 2024, I found out I was around 4-5 weeks pregnant. At that time I was thinking about ordering pills from WOW and doing the Pill Method instead, but since reading reviews that shipping could take quite a while, my boyfriend and I decided to go to Thailand instead. 


Before the trip and procedure, I talked to Jenny from Klongtun on Line. She gave me the options they had and the price list for all the procedure and the room rates, she also explained what to expect before the procedure (all the lab test and etc). So eventually I booked a slot for March 14 and she gave me an appoinment card. 


Fast forward to March 14, my boyfriend and I took an early morning flight from Manila to Bangkok after everything we checked in our hotel first and had late lunch, eventually we arrived at Klongtun Hospital at around 3:50 PM. 


This was how the process went for me:
- I showed them my appointment card then they quickly asked for my passport and 500thb (cash) for the ultrasound. 

- After the ultrasound, I found out I was already 8 weeks pregnant. 

- I had a consultation and the doctor recommended I do the MVA method, since the whole procedure would only take 5 minutes and I just had to rest for 2-3 hours after. She quoted me 11,000thb for everything (all the tests, MVA procedure, and room fee). She also disclosed that the doctor who will be doing my procedure is male. Afterwards, I paid the 11k using my debit card. 

- After paying, I waited for a bit to do the physical exam (they measured my height, weight, blood pressure, and they cleaned my V and did a pap smear, tbh the pap smear was kind of painful, more painful than the ones I've had in Manila). 

- After the physical exam, they asked my boyfriend to wait in another building then they accompanied me to leave my stuff on the 2nd floor and then accompanied me to the 3rd floor to change to a hospital gown and remove my undies. 

- After changing to a hospital gown, they asked me to lie down first. At this point, there was another girl sleeping in the same room so I assumed I would also be resting there too. 

- After a few minutes they asked me to go to the operating room. It was quite hectic because as soon as I got there they asked me to lie down with my legs up, the nurse to my left stuck a needle on my left hand to sedate me to sleep, while the nurse to my right was measuring my blood pressure, then the nurse in front of me was cleaning my V for the procedure. I saw the male doctor walk in as well, all the nurses were female BTW. At this point, I was feeling very anxious and I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to sleep but yes I did fall asleep immediately after they sedated me. 

- After the procedure, I woke up in a different room with lots of beds but I was the only one there, and at this point the nurse in charge wouldn't let me go up to use the bathroom she just told me to rest and sleep. After a while, she did allow me to use the toilet and she said it was ok for me to use a bidet. At this time she showed me my new ultrasound and the baby was no longer there. She told me the don'ts after the procedure such as: don't drink or eat food that's too hot, don't use a hot compress but warm compress is ok, etc). She also told me that I was asleep for about an hour and a half. She also gave the medicine (ibuprofen, antibiotics, iron pills) and instructions post abortion. After that, I just changed to my clothes and used the sanitary pad they provided. 

- After I was done, I just chatted with some of the nurses they told me it was ok to eat spicy food and raw food. Just not to consume alcohol. 


*Some tips I think that would help:
- go on a weekday as the hospital is not crowded at all. 
- don't be shy to ask the hospital and doctors all your questions before and after the procedure. Based on my experience, they were very patient and answered everything for me. 
- the first few hours were painful for me (felt like really bad dysmenorrhea), but what really helped eased my cramps was doing a warm compress, emphasis on warm. I brought my own hot/cold pack and used it in the hotel. 
- be prepared for the Bangkok traffic, I thought Manila traffic was already crazy but Bangkok is on another level. Although in my opinion, the price of Grab here is better than in Manila. 
- I highly suggest doing this with someone you can trust, as the whole process is very overwhelming and honestly you will need help and assistance esp during the first few hours after the procedure.


I just wanted to share my experience for those who feel anxious about their situation now. For me, the whole experience was very comfortable and I'm glad I got the procedure and healthcare I needed without any prejudice. If you have any questions about the price of the procedure, or if you just have any questions I highly suggest messaging them directly. 

Will try to update again about the post abortion experience. So far it's been about 12 hours since and I don't feel any pain at all.

"2025-03-13",1741901137,"boyfriend left 3 months after abortion","I'm really just looking for emotional support, I've been going to therapy, talking to friends, but wanted to come into this space to see if others have had similar situations.

Backstory: My boyfriend was 13 years younger than me, I have 2 kids from a previous marriage, this was really the first time I was in love with someone again after my divorce which was a couple years out at this point. We got pregnant after seeing each other for about 3 months. At the time, it felt like an relatively easy answer. Never totally easy, especially as a mom, I know what it's like to go through pregnancy and give birth and love my babies, but I went ahead and opted for a MA right away. It ended up being fairly traumatic though, because it didn't work. I had to go in and get an ultrasound to confirm, and then went on to get a D&amp;C as soon as I could after that. So yeah, totally sucked, definitely left a mark on me more so than I would have expected. 

Fast-forward a few months later: I was on birth control pills now, and end up getting pregnant AGAIN anyways. This time, I'm feeling the effects of the previous experience, my boyfriend and I are much more stable and in love as a couple. I'm not really too spiritual but the chances of all this happening really floored me. I felt so much more protective of this pregnancy, big mama bear energy. Like I wanted to meet this person. I even started looking into open adoptions and contemplated what it would be like to raise a baby on my own, which honestly I felt pretty confident about. My boyfriend was freaked out, and basically gave me an ultimatum saying that if I went and kept the pregnancy he doesn't know if he could stay with me romantically at that point. I felt SO in love with this person that as soon as he said that, that was it, I felt so committed to our relationship and was like, I can't blame him for feeling this way, I get he was young and freaking out, but I choose him and our relationship. Had a harder time getting over this abortion, got depressed, the holidays were really rough for me. I was having a ton of depression and anxiety during this time. Then in January, about 3 months after the abortion, he broke up with me. 

It's been a couple months later, and I'm just SO angry and hurt. I'm such a loyal partner and I'm just so confused. I also hate the fact that this is causing me pain and I think about this all the time and I'm sure he hasn't even realized or given it a second thought. I usually have a lot of compassion for people, like if he needed to leave the relationship, I get it, but the timing still feels so awful, it still feels like I made a huge sacrifice for nothing.

I am 21, from the United States, and I thought I was doing what was right for me. I still believe that to be the case (I'm active duty military, still in school, and not mentally ready for a baby), but as the days go by I keep thinking about how things might have been. I still have the pregnancy tests from when I found out and I can't bring myself to get rid of them. 

I found out on March 1st, had my MA on the 7th. It all happened so fast that I didn't allow myself to feel any of the emotions until now. From the moment I found out, I had a gut feeling that it would have been a girl. After the initial shock, I accepted the fact that I was pregnant and grew attached to the life I was growing, even though I was only five weeks. I feel like I shouldn't be having these emotions, because it wasn't actually a baby, but I do. I don't have much of a support group (my fiance seems annoyed whenever I try to talk about it, my mother - though supportive - is very emotional and cries if I cry) so I'm mostly dealing with this alone.

He wanted to keep it, but ultimately told me he would support me through whatever decision I made. I was scared, and looking back I feel I made the cowardly decision. 

Fast forward to today, he broke up with me a few weeks ago saying he just didnt see us getting married. A few days ago he admitted (very kindly, gently, and while assuring me he has no ill will towards me) that he just never got past the abortion. He said deep down he doesnt think he truly forgave me for my decision, but didnt want me to feel that was my fault. He said this was his own emotional issue that he had to figure out himself. 

He was everything I wanted. I thought we would be married and starting a family soon. So did everyone around us. 

I feel so heartbroken that he doesnt forgive me. But Im more heartbroken because I truly regret the decision, and have since I did it. I cannot forgive myself. I hate myself for it. I cant help but feel like I was given everything I ever wanted, and I ruined it because I didnt trust it was the right time. I feel like god, the universe, whatever you believe in, is punishing me for not trusting the time was right, and for doing what I did. 

Im in such a dark place. I would give anything to go back and make a different decision. How do I ever forgive myself? ","abortion",5,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jas4oo/2_years_later_and_i_still_hate_myself/"
"2025-03-14",1741939059,"My experience with surgical abortion","Hello, I wanted to share my experience with a surgical abortion as I know reading other peoples experience helped ease my mind when I was going through it. It's quite detailed, feel free to skip straight to the abortion para, or the end if you just want the key takeaways. (I'm not going to be talking about the morality or debating, if you are pro-life this post isn't for you.)

PRE-ABORTION: I'm 23, I found out I was pregnant at 4 weeks, this was unplanned, I went to a doctor to discuss my options and was told if i wanted to terminate the pregnancy I had to be 5/6 weeks before I could have the pill. To schedule my abortion I called a woman's clinic and was recommended the surgical abortion from them which I was happier with having spoken to 2 people who had the medical one who both said they would recommend I do surgical instead. (I have a low pain tolerance and health anxiety so this made the most sense for me). For the next 2 weeks I had morning sickness and an intense fatigue accompanied with a lack of appetite and just genuinely feeling nauseous and exhausted all the time. 

ABORTION: The day of my abortion I was just over 5 weeks pregnant, when I got to the clinic i was initially in a waiting room, my boyfriend was with me, as I was going under anesthesia and so you have to have someone to drive you home and stay with you for the next 4 hours minimum. I was called in for the first part of it and was given the option to bring him with me up until the actual procedure, which i took. In this part I had an ultrasound where I saw the fetus (I wasn't asked if this is something I wanted to see), then I signed consent forms saying i wouldn't drive, understood the risks etc... 

Then I went into the next room where i spoke to the doctor who was going to be carrying out the abortion. There was a sign on the wall saying ""sometimes hard decisions are the right ones,"" which I liked. She asked me about contraception in the future and when i said condoms she accepted it without question and didn't try to pressure me into hormonal birth control which I've experienced with male doctors in the past. (We didnt use a condom the time I accidentally conceived). She then explained the procedure and that they would essentially be sucking it out of my uterus.  Next i spoke to the anesthesiologist who answered any of my questions regarding that. 

For the procedure I was given a lightweight pink robe instead of a hospital gown, a nurse took me through to the operating room. There was 3 people in total: nurse, doctor and anesthesiologist. I was freaking out at this point and they were compassionate with me and told me when the needle was going in, I began to get groggy and then they put a mask on my face and that was the last thing I remembered.

I woke up in a separate room, made private by a curtain, very groggy and confused, I was laying on a bed with a hot water bottle on my stomach. A nurse came in, asked me how i was feeling and if i wanted painkillers, to which i said yes. The pain wasn't that bad it was like period cramping I more so felt strange. They then offered me coffee/tea/juice and brought in a pack of biscuits and brought my boyfriend in to sit with me as the anesthesia started to wear off. I was there about 30/40 minutes from waking up before we were discharged. For the rest of the day I slept/ watched tv on the couch and took it really slow, as i was very tired. I have only had very minimal bleeding and light cramping since the procedure. The nausea and morning sickness went away instantly. I was given a course of antibiotics for 6 days to prevent infection as that is one of the most common side effects so i have taken one of them every day but for the most part I was fine after with very minimal pain (i used a hot water bottle, didn't need painkillers).

  
Overall I would say it went as well as it could and the procedure itself is nothing to be afraid of as you are in good hands and they do these things every single day multiple times a day, and I have a low pain tolerance and I really had very little (which was one of my main concerns). 

The only other thing to note was price, it was expensive, $700 Aud with Medicare but as i didn't have it i was $1200 out of pocket. ","abortion",4,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jayr3g/my_experience_with_surgical_abortion/"

I was also exactly 6 weeks when I did this. 

Wednesday, I took the first pill at 1:20pm and had absolutely no side effects to this. 

Thursday, at 2:40 I took Tylenol, ibuprofen and nausea meds then 3:20 I put the 4 pills in my mouth and let them dissolve and then I swallowed what was left of them. 
I IMMEDIATELY started getting cramps after I swallowed them I would say pain wise a 2/10 it felt like period cramps. By 5pm I started lightly bleeding and my cramps got stronger id say a 4/10. By 7pm I was still light bleeding in my pad but on the toilet I was having heavier bleeding and small clots coming out like the size of a orange seed or grain of rice. 
At 11pm I decided to take the 2nd dose of the 4 pills and by 12am I had super intense cramps 6/10 and more bleeding which then I had 1 larger clot come out that was still small but bigger then the others id say it was the size of a nickel. 
My bleeding never filled a pad during the day but overnight it got filled once and I still have some cramps on and off and bleeding.

I do not know how far along I am ( I am about to make an appointment at PP for next week) but Im guessing I am around 8-9 weeks. Unfortunately, I have to lie and say that I am having a miscarriage. There is more info below on that. 

A couple of things - I had a MA about a year ago. The process was long and extremely painful for me. I was bleeding heavily for about 24 hours, and kept bleeding for several days with pain. It was an extremely difficult process and I still felt completely drained at my follow up appointment.

I have a few reasons why I am not sure if a SA or MA is better.

1. I will not have an informed support system this time around. I dont want to get into too many details, but I have to lie and say that I had a miscarriage and not an abortion (I know some will think this is wrong. I am sorry but it is my situation. I will be leaving this situation once the abortion is done). This is the main reason why I think a MA might be better, unfortunately.

2. The pain. I understand SA is also painful, but from what I have read, it is much quicker. And I like the idea of having a medical team with me during the whole process. 

3. I am nervous about having to sneak to two separate appointments for an MA. 

I also have a few questions, if anyone is willing to share. 

1. How long do you bleed after the SA procedure? 

2. Can a doctor tell that I have had a surgical abortion if I go to the ER? I believe they cant tell if I have had an MA.

3. When I go to my appointment, will they do the SA on that day?

Hi, everyone. Im 22 years old located in Arizona, USA and recently had a medical abortion, which has been physically and emotionally overwhelming. Its been a few weeks since I took pill, and Im still dealing with a mix of physical symptoms, like bleeding, and feeling physically exhausted. Ive had moments where I felt like I couldnt even get out of bed due to the pain, and now Im just dealing with extremely sore boobs and light bleeding. 

Whats really hard is the emotional toll this has taken. I feel incredibly disconnected from my life, and sometimes like Im PMSing, just this intense sadness that comes and goes. The emotional part caught me off guard; Im crying more than usual and feeling like Im just stuck in a funk. I also feel a lack of support from people around me. I didnt tell anyone about the abortion and have gone through it all alone, which has made everything feel even more isolating. Ive realized I dont have anyone checking in on me to see how Im doing, and its been tough feeling so alone in this. Its hard to balance everything, my job, school, emotional health. I feel like I cant focus on anything. Im so overwhelmed and just want this feeling to go away.

The physical symptoms dont help either. Ive been feeling full faster, and eating is difficult now, which wasnt an issue before. Im trying to eat when I can, but my body feels off and Im just not sure whats going on with me. My boobs are still really sore, and its been a few weeks since the procedure, so thats been adding to everything.

I guess Im just looking for others who may have felt similar things post-abortion, or anyone who can share advice on how to get through this emotional rollercoaster. Im trying to stay positive, but right now, its been hard.

Thanks in advance.

So I thought I could track and that way Id prevent pregnancy and avoid getting on bc until his surgery that is now this month. I was told it was good way to avoid pregnancy if you didnt want to be on birth control. I figured I could handle that.

In the beginning he told me I had to get an abortion and at 6 weeks when we made the appointment to go to Planned Parenthood, I couldnt take the first pill. I sobbed and sobbed and begged him to not make me do this and he did not care. We had many fights before that appointment and after that appointment where he told me Im an awful selfish person if I keep the child and how its not okay to gamble on a childs happiness, as it will be adopted by its biological grandmother and still have contact with its birth mother (me). Sorry this is kind of all over the place, but at 4 weeks I told him I was keeping it and so he yelled at me about how much he hated me then left. I freaked out so I told him if he comes back Ill get an abortion. After the appointment where I couldnt take the pills, he left again. And for those two weeks where he was gone I have never been more depressed and lonely. I just missed him so much and wanted a partner in this. My first trimester was really really really rough (nausea, vomiting, MAJOR cramping, flu, sinus infection, ear infections, fatigue). I just began doubting if I could really survive these next 7 1/2 months and that maybe an abortion is whats best. He agreed, as he thinks its selfish to develop the embryo into a child. He said if i get an abortion hell be there for me 24/7 and whenever I need and do whatever I need but Im very unsure. Lately, I constantly cry about loving my baby and he just corrects me saying its an embryo still. But at the same time, if I get an abortion we would be together, wed live together over the summer, wed go on trips&but I know Ill regret it for the rest of my life. My biggest dream has been to have children and I know I wont be able to raise this child, but Im so attached already. I know Ill look at my future children and wonder what if. He says my regret will pass but I adamantly dont think it will& Im unsure what to do. I feel like Im choosing short term suffering over long term suffering. I cant talk to my family about this because they are pro life, so they would not be thrilled with my actions. I just dont know what to do. My gut is telling me to keep my baby but Idk if i can handle the depression and loneliness for these next few months. But I also dont know if i can handle that regret for the rest of my life.

I unfortunately had an abortion on 15th Jan 2025. I bled A LOT and for a while afterwards and it stopped a little and was a lot lighter around 10th Feb but then started again a day later heavily again for about a week then carried on a lighter (bloody discharge sorry if TMI) until about 25th Feb when it fully stopped, I am not sure whether this was still bleeding from the abortion or a period? Because I never fully stopped bleeding until the 25th if that makes sense? 

Google has said it can take 4-8 weeks for a period to return, its now been 8 weeks so is this normal or should I be worried? 

Ive been keeping an eye out on my period since as I am starting the patch but want to wait until I have an actual period so I can learn my menstrual cycle again and make sure I have had an actual period since the abortion before I get on contraception.

I started bleeding again earlier in the week but it lasted one day and then normal again until today where I am bleeding lightly. 

Its so hard to pin point what is a period and what isnt after an abortion >r has anyone experienced something similar or have some advice as Im keen to start contraception soon?

17 days ago I had a suction abortion, I was 6 weeks so early to handle what I had to do. 

Im 31 year old and I have a son who is 10 years old. 

I have a stable and supportive relationship with my boyfriend of almost 2 years and we live together in my houseboat. 

I had the abortion because my boyfriend wasnt ready yet (he is 23) and also the thought of having a baby on board is possible but not at all ideal. 
I did what I knew was best even tho I got warm fuzzy feelings towards the idea of being pregnant and having a love baby together. 

Since Im not on birthcontrol (I tried several times but I have a lot of side effects wich I dont want to have) I asked if he would want a vesectomy (excuse my English as it isnt my language) but he doesnt want that so we agreed on condoms. 

I made him clear that I want him to take the lead and the responsibility in this since he is the one that isnt ready to have kids, pointed out where I put the new package of condoms etc (within reach) 

Today (17 days after the abortion) we had sex for the first time, you probably hear it coming already; as he started cuddling and slides it in unprotected.. even tho I did warn him several times AND told him I dont want to have had this abortion for nothing as we have the risk of getting pregnant directly. 

I did push him out eventually and he is a very supportive and good lovely guy but this action of him gave me a lot of emotions so I wanted to talk about it in this group. 
Afterwards I did confront him as well about if he did think when he just pushed it in and he said he did but couldnt resist.

Its killing me because Im terrified to experience that pain again, but also the guilt that we both want children.

I feel so angry, and depressed that I cant properly decide on keeping the baby and settling to loose our freedom, or to abort and seek the life we wanted?

"2025-03-14",1741941564,"Abortion Is Okay Because Its Their Choice","At the end of the day, abortion is a personal decision, and no one should be forced to stay pregnant against their will. Pregnancy is a major medical event that affects a persons body, health, future, and life in ways that only they can fully understand. No one else has to experience the physical pain, the risks, the emotional toll, or the lifelong consequences of giving birthso why should anyone else get to decide?

Some argue that a fetus has a right to life, but even if we grant that, no one has the right to use another persons body without consent. We dont force people to donate organs, even if it would save a life. If bodily autonomy applies to everyone else, why should it suddenly stop applying to pregnant people?

People get abortions for all kinds of reasonsfinancial instability, medical risks, being too young, not wanting to be a parent, or simply not wanting to be pregnant. And they shouldnt have to justify it. No one is obligated to give up their body for someone else, and pregnancy should be no exception.

If someone believes abortion is wrong, they dont have to get one. But forcing others to stay pregnant against their will is not about valuing lifeits about controlling peoples bodies.","Abortiondebate",220,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jazbb9/abortion_is_okay_because_its_their_choice/"
"2025-03-13",1741893655,"PL for religious reasons - why are your churchs teachings on reproductive rights the 100% absolute truth?","One of the biggest arguments that I see PL make is that the Bible says abortion is wrong &amp; it goes against Christian values. Faith is not something I particularly relate to, but I do think it can be comforting and deeply personal. In fact, I think its admirable that people can so strongly believe in something that there is not necessarily physical evidence of - I am truly happy for all who find comfort in it.

My question is: why do you feel that your denominations abortion beliefs is correct and above all others?

There are 6 main branches of Christianity &amp; all of them have varying beliefs on abortion. Many protestant denominations are not only pro-choice, but actively advocate for womens reproductive rights. About 60% of Catholics are pro-choice, despite the churchs view on it. 40% of Evangelical Protestants support abortion in cases of rape &amp; 51% are in support for medical reasons. The Mormon, Episcopal, Methodist &amp; Southern Baptist churches support abortion in cases of rape &amp; medical reasons. 

Of course we also need to recognize that many Christian denominations are against it. I am not denying that. But even the churchs messaging is more empathetic &amp; does not include the typical you opened your legs, deal with it sentiment I see from a lot of PL Christians. For example, Pope Francis, who is against abortion, recognizes and advocates for more support for women seeking an abortion, such as grace, community and love. The Baptist Churchs stance preaches the need for access to contraception, community support &amp; financial help. They also acknowledge the complexity of abortion, and even stated this: We acknowledge that we often lack compassion, insight &amp; the necessary commitment to serve our Christian community. We affirm our commitment to &. maintain fellowship with those whose opinions differ from ours and extend the compassion of Christ to all. 

So PL Christians, why are you so adamant that your denominations teachings are correct? Why is whatever your pastor says the 100% absolute truth? Are those who take a more liberal stance not a true Christian and if so, why do you think you or your church has the right to decide what makes someone a real Christian?

How do you justify the contradictions in the Bible? There is not a soul on earth who can never sin, even the Bible says so. Why is abortion one of the worst sins, if all sins are equal? Why do you choose that abortion is wrong, but ignore the part about loving thy neighbor and not judging? Why are you a better Christian than your neighbor who attends a more liberal church down the street?

"2025-03-14",1741930652,"Hypothetical for PL: A perfect form of birth control","A new form of perfect birth control is developed. It has 100% efficiency and will stop 100% of unintended pregnancies. 

Here is how it will work: Nano-bots are placed inside the female reproductive system. They work by monitoring the reproductive system for new, unique human DNA. If fertilization occurs, and such unique DNA is detected, the cell containing it is destroyed by the nano-bot. 

Not only does this stop 100% of unintended pregnancies when used, they are perfectly safe for the AFAB person as they only attack unknown, unique human DNA. And, it's completely reversible, simply through remote control. 

Assuming this form of birth control could be cheap and widely available, it would most certainly have a massive impact in the abortion rate. Would the PL movement accept this as a valid alternative to bans? Are there any individual PLers in this subreddit who would find this acceptable?","Abortiondebate",100,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jawucb/hypothetical_for_pl_a_perfect_form_of_birth/"

This unborn child was diagnosed with spina bifida at 20 weeks gestation. At 24 weeks, surgeons removed the child from her mothers womb and performed a surgery to repair her spinal cord. They then returned her to her mothers womb to complete the pregnancy. 

Was this child a person after being removed? Was she a non-person again after being put back in? 

Im particularly curious: suppose after being removed, the doctors determined the childs condition was more serious than anticipated and surgery offered little hope of improving the childs disability. Or, the doctors discovered another fetal abnormality inconsistent with life while the child was out. Should the mother still have the option to abort? If the mother did choose abortion at this point, why go the trouble of putting the child back in, aborting the child, then removing the child a second time as a corpse?

At the same Time through, most of abortion issues originate from the ethicality of It, which can't be completely objective because good and evil are overall subjective. Considering this, i think that the best overall ""objective"" solution to abortion issues would be a solution that wouldn't overall discriminately attack the fetus and/or the mother. The question is if It can actually be resolved in a way that would be found by the most amount possible of people as acceptable. We could try, like It Is done in many other ethical issues, to make a conclusion based on whenever or not human rights are respected in the situation. If we theorically consider fetuses as human lives(this statement Is found by overall most biologists as true based on multiple surveys such as the biomed One or others), then the killing of the human being would be considered as Murder as long as It Is premediated and unjustificate. In the law, with some excemption, Murder Is usually Only justificate if It Is done in self defense. Based on It, It can be found that if the fetus can potentially put the Life of the mother at risk, abortion would be a self defense of her Life. At the same Time through, this solution, even if It follow something objective such as the law, It probably wouldn't content a large amount of people. In conclusion, do you think that finding the overall Better solutions ( based on It being found by many as acceptable while It not discriminately attacking the mother and or the fetus) could be possible or not?

Since the last abortion, weve been super careful and honestly it was super low chances that I even became pregnant this time around.

"2025-03-13",1741893655,"PL for religious reasons - why are your churchs teachings on reproductive rights the 100% absolute truth?","One of the biggest arguments that I see PL make is that the Bible says abortion is wrong &amp; it goes against Christian values. Faith is not something I particularly relate to, but I do think it can be comforting and deeply personal. In fact, I think its admirable that people can so strongly believe in something that there is not necessarily physical evidence of - I am truly happy for all who find comfort in it.

My question is: why do you feel that your denominations abortion beliefs is correct and above all others?

There are 6 main branches of Christianity &amp; all of them have varying beliefs on abortion. Many protestant denominations are not only pro-choice, but actively advocate for womens reproductive rights. About 60% of Catholics are pro-choice, despite the churchs view on it. 40% of Evangelical Protestants support abortion in cases of rape &amp; 51% are in support for medical reasons. The Mormon, Episcopal, Methodist &amp; Southern Baptist churches support abortion in cases of rape &amp; medical reasons. 

Of course we also need to recognize that many Christian denominations are against it. I am not denying that. But even the churchs messaging is more empathetic &amp; does not include the typical you opened your legs, deal with it sentiment I see from a lot of PL Christians. For example, Pope Francis, who is against abortion, recognizes and advocates for more support for women seeking an abortion, such as grace, community and love. The Baptist Churchs stance preaches the need for access to contraception, community support &amp; financial help. They also acknowledge the complexity of abortion, and even stated this: We acknowledge that we often lack compassion, insight &amp; the necessary commitment to serve our Christian community. We affirm our commitment to &. maintain fellowship with those whose opinions differ from ours and extend the compassion of Christ to all. 

So PL Christians, why are you so adamant that your denominations teachings are correct? Why is whatever your pastor says the 100% absolute truth?

It's quite detailed, feel free to skip straight to the abortion para, or the end if you just want the key takeaways. (I'm not going to be talking about the morality or debating, if you are pro-life this post isn't for you.)

PRE-ABORTION: I'm 23, I found out I was pregnant at 4 weeks, this was unplanned, I went to a doctor to discuss my options and was told if i wanted to terminate the pregnancy I had to be 5/6 weeks before I could have the pill. To schedule my abortion I called a woman's clinic and was recommended the surgical abortion from them which I was happier with having spoken to 2 people who had the medical one who both said they would recommend I do surgical instead. (I have a low pain tolerance and health anxiety so this made the most sense for me). For the next 2 weeks I had morning sickness and an intense fatigue accompanied with a lack of appetite and just genuinely feeling nauseous and exhausted all the time. 

ABORTION: The day of my abortion I was just over 5 weeks pregnant, when I got to the clinic i was initially in a waiting room, my boyfriend was with me, as I was going under anesthesia and so you have to have someone to drive you home and stay with you for the next 4 hours minimum. I was called in for the first part of it and was given the option to bring him with me up until the actual procedure, which i took. In this part I had an ultrasound where I saw the fetus (I wasn't asked if this is something I wanted to see), then I signed consent forms saying i wouldn't drive, understood the risks etc... 

Then I went into the next room where i spoke to the doctor who was going to be carrying out the abortion. There was a sign on the wall saying ""sometimes hard decisions are the right ones,"" which I liked. She asked me about contraception in the future and when i said condoms she accepted it without question and didn't try to pressure me into hormonal birth control which I've experienced with male doctors in the past. (We didnt use a condom the time I accidentally conceived). She then explained the procedure and that they would essentially be sucking it out of my uterus.  Next i spoke to the anesthesiologist who answered any of my questions regarding that. 

For the procedure I was given a lightweight pink robe instead of a hospital gown, a nurse took me through to the operating room. There was 3 people in total: nurse, doctor and anesthesiologist. I was freaking out at this point and they were compassionate with me and told me when the needle was going in, I began to get groggy and then they put a mask on my face and that was the last thing I remembered.

I woke up in a separate room, made private by a curtain, very groggy and confused, I was laying on a bed with a hot water bottle on my stomach. A nurse came in, asked me how i was feeling and if i wanted painkillers, to which i said yes. The pain wasn't that bad it was like period cramping I more so felt strange. They then offered me coffee/tea/juice and brought in a pack of biscuits and brought my boyfriend in to sit with me as the anesthesia started to wear off. I was there about 30/40 minutes from waking up before we were discharged. For the rest of the day I slept/ watched tv on the couch and took it really slow, as i was very tired. I have only had very minimal bleeding and light cramping since the procedure. The nausea and morning sickness went away instantly. I was given a course of antibiotics for 6 days to prevent infection as that is one of the most common side effects so i have taken one of them every day but for the most part I was fine after with very minimal pain (i used a hot water bottle, didn't need painkillers).

  
Overall I would say it went as well as it could and the procedure itself is nothing to be afraid of as you are in good hands and they do these things every single day multiple times a day, and I have a low pain tolerance and I really had very little (which was one of my main concerns). 

The only other thing to note was price, it was expensive, $700 Aud with Medicare but as i didn't have it i was $1200 out of pocket. ","abortion",4,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jayr3g/my_experience_with_surgical_abortion/"
"2025-03-13",1741894005,"im torn whether to get an abortion (CA)","Im 18 years old and in college. Im 10 1/2 weeks pregnant and have an appointment to get an abortion tomorrow (pills). But I have so much fear and anxiety around it. I told my mom and grandma I was pregnant at 3 weeks right after I found out. They were very supportive and my mom and stepdad would adopt the baby. They have two young children (under 4 years old), so my baby would be in their age range. Im also due the week before next school year starts so my pregnancy doesnt affect my schooling. When I first found out, I was so scared and nervous, but loved my baby immediately. At 6 weeks I had an ultrasound and saw the little blob and I felt so much excitement, even though I knew I would never get to raise it. HOWEVER, the issue is, my partner does not want this child. In the beginning he told me I had to get an abortion and at 6 weeks when we made the appointment to go to Planned Parenthood, I couldnt take the first pill. I sobbed and sobbed and begged him to not make me do this and he did not care. We had many fights before that appointment and after that appointment where he told me Im an awful selfish person if I keep the child and how its not okay to gamble on a childs happiness, as it will be adopted by its biological grandmother and still have contact with its birth mother (me). Sorry this is kind of all over the place, but at 4 weeks I told him I was keeping it and so he yelled at me about how much he hated me then left. I freaked out so I told him if he comes back Ill get an abortion. After the appointment where I couldnt take the pills, he left again. And for those two weeks where he was gone I have never been more depressed and lonely. I just missed him so much and wanted a partner in this. My first trimester was really really really rough (nausea, vomiting, MAJOR cramping, flu, sinus infection, ear infections, fatigue). I just began doubting if I could really survive these next 7 1/2 months and that maybe an abortion is whats best. He agreed, as he thinks its selfish to develop the embryo into a child. He said if i get an abortion hell be there for me 24/7 and whenever I need and do whatever I need but Im very unsure. Lately, I constantly cry about loving my baby and he just corrects me saying its an embryo still. But at the same time, if I get an abortion we would be together, wed live together over the summer, wed go on trips&but I know Ill regret it for the rest of my life. My biggest dream has been to have children and I know I wont be able to raise this child, but Im so attached already. I know Ill look at my future children and wonder what if. He says my regret will pass but I adamantly dont think it will& Im unsure what to do. I feel like Im choosing short term suffering over long term suffering. I cant talk to my family about this because they are pro life, so they would not be thrilled with my actions. I just dont know what to do. My gut is telling me to keep my baby but Idk if i can handle the depression and loneliness for these next few months. But I also dont know if i can handle that regret for the rest of my life.

I couldn't come up with any good reason to have a child but now I regret it. I wanted to take care of it. I wanted to apologize. It had eyes and a nose and a mouth and legs and arms and fingers. I feel so terrible. I don't know who to talk to about this. Only my mom and boyfriend knew I was pregnant. My mom doesn't want to talk to me about it at all. She doesn't agree with abortions. My boyfriend was very supportive at the moment but doesn't seem to want to talk about it anymore. I have the image of the baby in the palm of my hand covered in blood burned into my mind. I feel so alone and it's eating me up. I haven't been sleeping. I just feel so bad. I know this was the right thing to do but I just can't help but feel like such a failure.","abortion",13,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jatswq/mixed_feelings_about_my_abortion/"
"2025-03-14",1741939059,"My experience with surgical abortion","Hello, I wanted to share my experience with a surgical abortion as I know reading other peoples experience helped ease my mind when I was going through it. It's quite detailed, feel free to skip straight to the abortion para, or the end if you just want the key takeaways. (I'm not going to be talking about the morality or debating, if you are pro-life this post isn't for you.)

PRE-ABORTION: I'm 23, I found out I was pregnant at 4 weeks, this was unplanned, I went to a doctor to discuss my options and was told if i wanted to terminate the pregnancy I had to be 5/6 weeks before I could have the pill. To schedule my abortion I called a woman's clinic and was recommended the surgical abortion from them which I was happier with having spoken to 2 people who had the medical one who both said they would recommend I do surgical instead. (I have a low pain tolerance and health anxiety so this made the most sense for me). For the next 2 weeks I had morning sickness and an intense fatigue accompanied with a lack of appetite and just genuinely feeling nauseous and exhausted all the time. 

ABORTION: The day of my abortion I was just over 5 weeks pregnant, when I got to the clinic i was initially in a waiting room, my boyfriend was with me, as I was going under anesthesia and so you have to have someone to drive you home and stay with you for the next 4 hours minimum. I was called in for the first part of it and was given the option to bring him with me up until the actual procedure, which i took. In this part I had an ultrasound where I saw the fetus (I wasn't asked if this is something I wanted to see), then I signed consent forms saying i wouldn't drive, understood the risks etc... 

Then I went into the next room where i spoke to the doctor who was going to be carrying out the abortion. There was a sign on the wall saying ""sometimes hard decisions are the right ones,"" which I liked. She asked me about contraception in the future and when i said condoms she accepted it without question and didn't try to pressure me into hormonal birth control which I've experienced with male doctors in the past. (We didnt use a condom the time I accidentally conceived). She then explained the procedure and that they would essentially be sucking it out of my uterus.  Next i spoke to the anesthesiologist who answered any of my questions regarding that. 

For the procedure I was given a lightweight pink robe instead of a hospital gown, a nurse took me through to the operating room. There was 3 people in total: nurse, doctor and anesthesiologist. I was freaking out at this point and they were compassionate with me and told me when the needle was going in, I began to get groggy and then they put a mask on my face and that was the last thing I remembered.

I woke up in a separate room, made private by a curtain, very groggy and confused, I was laying on a bed with a hot water bottle on my stomach. A nurse came in, asked me how i was feeling and if i wanted painkillers, to which i said yes. The pain wasn't that bad it was like period cramping I more so felt strange. They then offered me coffee/tea/juice and brought in a pack of biscuits and brought my boyfriend in to sit with me as the anesthesia started to wear off. I was there about 30/40 minutes from waking up before we were discharged. For the rest of the day I slept/ watched tv on the couch and took it really slow, as i was very tired. I have only had very minimal bleeding and light cramping since the procedure. The nausea and morning sickness went away instantly. I was given a course of antibiotics for 6 days to prevent infection as that is one of the most common side effects so i have taken one of them every day but for the most part I was fine after with very minimal pain (i used a hot water bottle, didn't need painkillers).

  
Overall I would say it went as well as it could and the procedure itself is nothing to be afraid of as you are in good hands and they do these things every single day multiple times a day, and I have a low pain tolerance and I really had very little (which was one of my main concerns).

"2025-03-14",1741941564,"Abortion Is Okay Because Its Their Choice","At the end of the day, abortion is a personal decision, and no one should be forced to stay pregnant against their will. Pregnancy is a major medical event that affects a persons body, health, future, and life in ways that only they can fully understand. No one else has to experience the physical pain, the risks, the emotional toll, or the lifelong consequences of giving birthso why should anyone else get to decide?

Some argue that a fetus has a right to life, but even if we grant that, no one has the right to use another persons body without consent. We dont force people to donate organs, even if it would save a life. If bodily autonomy applies to everyone else, why should it suddenly stop applying to pregnant people?

People get abortions for all kinds of reasonsfinancial instability, medical risks, being too young, not wanting to be a parent, or simply not wanting to be pregnant. And they shouldnt have to justify it. No one is obligated to give up their body for someone else, and pregnancy should be no exception.

If someone believes abortion is wrong, they dont have to get one. But forcing others to stay pregnant against their will is not about valuing lifeits about controlling peoples bodies.","Abortiondebate",220,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jazbb9/abortion_is_okay_because_its_their_choice/"
"2025-03-13",1741908318,"Is It even possible to find the overall Better objective solution to abortion issues?","A thing that i notice in so many abortion discussions Is that, usually, the best solution to abortion issues end up being Just subjective to the individual view on the matter. At the same Time through, most of abortion issues originate from the ethicality of It, which can't be completely objective because good and evil are overall subjective. Considering this, i think that the best overall ""objective"" solution to abortion issues would be a solution that wouldn't overall discriminately attack the fetus and/or the mother. The question is if It can actually be resolved in a way that would be found by the most amount possible of people as acceptable. We could try, like It Is done in many other ethical issues, to make a conclusion based on whenever or not human rights are respected in the situation. If we theorically consider fetuses as human lives(this statement Is found by overall most biologists as true based on multiple surveys such as the biomed One or others), then the killing of the human being would be considered as Murder as long as It Is premediated and unjustificate. In the law, with some excemption, Murder Is usually Only justificate if It Is done in self defense. Based on It, It can be found that if the fetus can potentially put the Life of the mother at risk, abortion would be a self defense of her Life. At the same Time through, this solution, even if It follow something objective such as the law, It probably wouldn't content a large amount of people. In conclusion, do you think that finding the overall Better solutions ( based on It being found by many as acceptable while It not discriminately attacking the mother and or the fetus) could be possible or not? If yes, how?","Abortiondebate",179,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1japy44/is_it_even_possible_to_find_the_overall_better/"

"2025-03-13",1741897800,"Am I overreacting?","I have a 3 way group chat with a new friend in common with a girl I've been friends with since I was a teenager. (I'm 25) and thought she was a lil odd when she started texting in it daily after the 3 of us hung out once for an hour this past NYE. Any who, I found out I was pregnant Feb 2nd and we had never spoke of babies up until I found out I was preggo. She got completely fixated on that and did everything she could to suddenly get pregnant shortly after. She would send messages almost nightly about how she just got 'creampied' and give like all these details of how she was keeping the semen inside to get preggo. And then suddenly she said she and her boyfriend had been trying for a while to get pregnant and it never worked..... Well she sent a positive test probably around 2 weeks ago and she found out when she was like 8 days pregnant and had booked an ultrasound the day of at PP. Freaked out because they couldn't see the baby (because she literally just got pregnant but for some reason lied and told them she was 4 weeks pregnant) and has just been fucking non stop ever sense. I caught her lying about her saying her boyfriend was 'actively' trying to get her pregnant for a while, because now that she is he's not excited because hes 23 and he said he wasn't planning to have a baby and basically just said she started getting crazy about it out of nowhere....... I shit you not she has been daily been sending messages EVEN AT 9 DAYS PREGNANT about having food aversions, nausea, all this stuff but then when she was worried that they didn't see anything at 8 days pregnant she admitted she hasn't had any symptoms so she was concerned that they were saying they didn't see any signs of a fetus. It's just been so weird. Every day she's been non stop and normally I would be excited to have someone to relate to but I feel like she is pushing it all so hard. I struggled so bad between weeks 6-9 and she just doesn't understand idk. I'm sure she's starting to have symptoms at 4 weeks, but every single day its something but then shes out doing a whoooooole bunch of stuff which I feel like contradicts what she says and I just find it hard to believe how authentic shes being about it all because shes just been weirding me out entirely honestly. every day she just talks about herself nonstop and will go on and on and on &amp; not pick up social cues of when to stop and sometimes its like overly detailed and TMI??? She once sent a photo of toilet paper after she wiped to show her discharge ?

We were all talking in the chat today and she of course is already just going on and on and on about how shes already created her baby registry and shes going to start sending it out and she sent it in the chat to my friend &amp; I, and she was just saying how excited she is etc and I responded saying I'm just nervous because its a complete life change and something I've obviously never done before (she hasn't either) and that i hope i will be a good mom etc and she responded this entire paragraph saying this"" sometimes being a mother isn't meant for everyone, you really have to consider if this is the right choice for you, it is going to be a life altering decision, and a addition to your life that once its here it is truly your responsibility. you are a very young girl and you already have a lot of animals, if you genuinely don't think being a mother is something your going to want to do for the next 16 years until they get their license, its okay to wait a bit longer. i don't want to stress you out but there are going to be sacrifices. this is legit the rest of your life that's going to be changed. god forbid they do a sport that you hate."" and i was honestly appalled by this message. She made me feel like i was SO out of line for saying I'm genuinely nervous to be a mother and i get anxious thinking about it sometimes. Like who are you to tell me that at all? Idk. The girl just rubs me wrong honestly. Or maybe I'm just a bitch.

I discovered I was pregnant on Feb 26th; I'd had what I thought was a light period on January 29th-30th-31st, but it turns out that must have been implantation bleeding. I thought I was only 10 days late for my period based on the timing of that bleed, but it turns out I was much further along. I hadn't had many symptoms except for very sore breasts, some tiredness and loss of appetite, all of which I tend to get before my cycle anyway, so I didn't clue in right away.

I'm in a solid, loving relationship, but we just aren't currently in a situation to add to our family. I have a young child from my previous relationship, and we live in a fairly modest apartment, and for many other reasons it just wouldn't be right to add to the family right now. 

I was a bit panicked when I found out I was pregnant, but my partner was incredibly supportive and understanding. I called my doctor the same day and was referred to our local hospital which has a program for women seeking termination. My partner brought me to the appointment, which was on Wednesday of this week. I'm based in Canada and so it was a very calm and non-judgmental environment; I'm grateful to the doctor and nurse who walked me through my options and explained everything to me.

I was given an ultrasound and blood test the same day and they determined I was at exactly 10 weeks and 0 days, the cutoff for using medical termination in my province. They mentioned I could either schedule a surgical termination for the following week, or do the medical termination as long as I was willing to take the first pill that day. I decided on the medical because I wanted to end the pregnancy as soon as possible - my last pregnancy and birth process were extremely traumatic, and being pregnant again was giving me nightmares and flashbacks, so I couldn't handle the thought of waiting any longer.

Timeline:

6:00 pm Wednesday: took the mifepristone dose as directed. Had some very mild cramping starting about two hours later, which continued the following day.

1:00 pm Thursday: developed a headache, had some additional cramping and mildly upset stomach through the rest of the afternoon.

6:00 pm: took 10 mg ketorolac with a small amount of food.

6:45 pm: took 4 Misoprostol tablets in the cheek for 30 minutes as directed, washed down with water afterwards.

9:00 pm: started having some mild cramping which came in waves, slight chills. Very mild nausea which didn't last. Watched TV with partner and just tried to relax.

10:00 pm: started having some light spotting, cramps continuing. Cramps felt like my worst period day, nothing too major. Chills and started to have diarrhea.

10:45 pm: listened to an audiobook and went to sleep.

11:30 pm: woke up to a strange sensation, felt almost like my hands weren't attached to my body. Felt something shift in my lower abdomen, then a rush of fluid. Fortunately I was wearing heavy duty period undies in addition to a pad already and had no leakage. Went to the bathroom expecting pure blood but discovered it was pink tinted fluid which I assume was water breaking. Pad completely saturated. Pain very minimal.

As soon as I sat down on the toilet I felt something drop out. Had the sensation of needing to push, did so and a much larger clump came rushing out, along with quite a bit of blood. Peeked into the toilet and could see a ring shaped clot, and noticed a light pink thing partially submerged in the blood. It was not pleasant to see and I could tell it was part of a leg/lower torso of the embryo, extremely small but unmistakable.

Had a bit of a cry. Said I was sorry. Remembered what some of the other women have said on here about their babies becoming part of the water. I did not want to be pregnant, but I couldn't help but have feelings about it. I stayed for a while before saying goodbye and flushing.

1:30 am: woke up again, mild cramping and passed some more clots. Took a second ketorolac. Came back to bed and fell asleep easily.

6:00 am: woke up at my normal time, immediately felt different than I'd been feeling for the last few weeks. Breasts still a little sore but pain noticeably reduced from how they had been feeling prior. Did not have the morning upset stomach, and was able to enjoy a coffee (I'd been having aversion to it for about three weeks). Actually had energy as opposed to feeling extremely fatigued. Had moderate amount of blood on the pad and a few tiny clots when going to the bathroom, similar to a day 2 period.

10:30 am (present): cramps have almost completely subsided, have not needed more ketorolac. Ate some breakfast. Still have what is similar to a day 2 period. Energy is much higher than it normally is at this time of the morning.

I will still need to monitor for unusual bleeding, signs of infection, or increasing pain, and will need a follow up to confirm everything has passed, but ultimately the process was not what I expected. I originally worried that 4 Misoprostol wouldn't be sufficient, given that I was 10 weeks along and I've seen stories on here of women needing double the dose. I was worried it wasn't working initially as it took quite some time for the bleeding to start.

I feel so terrible. I don't know who to talk to about this. Only my mom and boyfriend knew I was pregnant. My mom doesn't want to talk to me about it at all. She doesn't agree with abortions. My boyfriend was very supportive at the moment but doesn't seem to want to talk about it anymore. I have the image of the baby in the palm of my hand covered in blood burned into my mind.

"2025-03-13",1741908477,"PH to BKK Experience (Klongtun Hospital)","Hello everyone! I just wanted to share my experience getting an MVA (Manual Vacuum Aspiration) from Klongtun Hospital in Thailand. 


So on February 2024, I found out I was around 4-5 weeks pregnant. At that time I was thinking about ordering pills from WOW and doing the Pill Method instead, but since reading reviews that shipping could take quite a while, my boyfriend and I decided to go to Thailand instead. 


Before the trip and procedure, I talked to Jenny from Klongtun on Line. She gave me the options they had and the price list for all the procedure and the room rates, she also explained what to expect before the procedure (all the lab test and etc). So eventually I booked a slot for March 14 and she gave me an appoinment card. 


Fast forward to March 14, my boyfriend and I took an early morning flight from Manila to Bangkok after everything we checked in our hotel first and had late lunch, eventually we arrived at Klongtun Hospital at around 3:50 PM. 


This was how the process went for me:
- I showed them my appointment card then they quickly asked for my passport and 500thb (cash) for the ultrasound. 

- After the ultrasound, I found out I was already 8 weeks pregnant. 

- I had a consultation and the doctor recommended I do the MVA method, since the whole procedure would only take 5 minutes and I just had to rest for 2-3 hours after. She quoted me 11,000thb for everything (all the tests, MVA procedure, and room fee). She also disclosed that the doctor who will be doing my procedure is male. Afterwards, I paid the 11k using my debit card. 

- After paying, I waited for a bit to do the physical exam (they measured my height, weight, blood pressure, and they cleaned my V and did a pap smear, tbh the pap smear was kind of painful, more painful than the ones I've had in Manila). 

- After the physical exam, they asked my boyfriend to wait in another building then they accompanied me to leave my stuff on the 2nd floor and then accompanied me to the 3rd floor to change to a hospital gown and remove my undies. 

- After changing to a hospital gown, they asked me to lie down first. At this point, there was another girl sleeping in the same room so I assumed I would also be resting there too. 

- After a few minutes they asked me to go to the operating room. It was quite hectic because as soon as I got there they asked me to lie down with my legs up, the nurse to my left stuck a needle on my left hand to sedate me to sleep, while the nurse to my right was measuring my blood pressure, then the nurse in front of me was cleaning my V for the procedure. I saw the male doctor walk in as well, all the nurses were female BTW. At this point, I was feeling very anxious and I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to sleep but yes I did fall asleep immediately after they sedated me. 

- After the procedure, I woke up in a different room with lots of beds but I was the only one there, and at this point the nurse in charge wouldn't let me go up to use the bathroom she just told me to rest and sleep. After a while, she did allow me to use the toilet and she said it was ok for me to use a bidet. At this time she showed me my new ultrasound and the baby was no longer there. She told me the don'ts after the procedure such as: don't drink or eat food that's too hot, don't use a hot compress but warm compress is ok, etc). She also told me that I was asleep for about an hour and a half. She also gave the medicine (ibuprofen, antibiotics, iron pills) and instructions post abortion. After that, I just changed to my clothes and used the sanitary pad they provided. 

- After I was done, I just chatted with some of the nurses they told me it was ok to eat spicy food and raw food. Just not to consume alcohol. 


*Some tips I think that would help:
- go on a weekday as the hospital is not crowded at all. 
- don't be shy to ask the hospital and doctors all your questions before and after the procedure. Based on my experience, they were very patient and answered everything for me. 
- the first few hours were painful for me (felt like really bad dysmenorrhea), but what really helped eased my cramps was doing a warm compress, emphasis on warm. I brought my own hot/cold pack and used it in the hotel. 
- be prepared for the Bangkok traffic, I thought Manila traffic was already crazy but Bangkok is on another level. Although in my opinion, the price of Grab here is better than in Manila. 
- I highly suggest doing this with someone you can trust, as the whole process is very overwhelming and honestly you will need help and assistance esp during the first few hours after the procedure.


I just wanted to share my experience for those who feel anxious about their situation now. For me, the whole experience was very comfortable and I'm glad I got the procedure and healthcare I needed without any prejudice. If you have any questions about the price of the procedure, or if you just have any questions I highly suggest messaging them directly. 

Will try to update again about the post abortion experience. So far it's been about 12 hours since and I don't feel any pain at all.

I am 21, from the United States, and I thought I was doing what was right for me. I still believe that to be the case (I'm active duty military, still in school, and not mentally ready for a baby), but as the days go by I keep thinking about how things might have been. I still have the pregnancy tests from when I found out and I can't bring myself to get rid of them. 

I found out on March 1st, had my MA on the 7th. It all happened so fast that I didn't allow myself to feel any of the emotions until now. From the moment I found out, I had a gut feeling that it would have been a girl. After the initial shock, I accepted the fact that I was pregnant and grew attached to the life I was growing, even though I was only five weeks. I feel like I shouldn't be having these emotions, because it wasn't actually a baby, but I do. I don't have much of a support group (my fiance seems annoyed whenever I try to talk about it, my mother - though supportive - is very emotional and cries if I cry) so I'm mostly dealing with this alone.

"2025-03-13",1741901137,"boyfriend left 3 months after abortion","I'm really just looking for emotional support, I've been going to therapy, talking to friends, but wanted to come into this space to see if others have had similar situations.

Backstory: My boyfriend was 13 years younger than me, I have 2 kids from a previous marriage, this was really the first time I was in love with someone again after my divorce which was a couple years out at this point. We got pregnant after seeing each other for about 3 months. At the time, it felt like an relatively easy answer. Never totally easy, especially as a mom, I know what it's like to go through pregnancy and give birth and love my babies, but I went ahead and opted for a MA right away. It ended up being fairly traumatic though, because it didn't work. I had to go in and get an ultrasound to confirm, and then went on to get a D&amp;C as soon as I could after that. So yeah, totally sucked, definitely left a mark on me more so than I would have expected. 

Fast-forward a few months later: I was on birth control pills now, and end up getting pregnant AGAIN anyways. This time, I'm feeling the effects of the previous experience, my boyfriend and I are much more stable and in love as a couple. I'm not really too spiritual but the chances of all this happening really floored me. I felt so much more protective of this pregnancy, big mama bear energy. Like I wanted to meet this person. I even started looking into open adoptions and contemplated what it would be like to raise a baby on my own, which honestly I felt pretty confident about. My boyfriend was freaked out, and basically gave me an ultimatum saying that if I went and kept the pregnancy he doesn't know if he could stay with me romantically at that point. I felt SO in love with this person that as soon as he said that, that was it, I felt so committed to our relationship and was like, I can't blame him for feeling this way, I get he was young and freaking out, but I choose him and our relationship. Had a harder time getting over this abortion, got depressed, the holidays were really rough for me. I was having a ton of depression and anxiety during this time. Then in January, about 3 months after the abortion, he broke up with me. 

It's been a couple months later, and I'm just SO angry and hurt. I'm such a loyal partner and I'm just so confused. I also hate the fact that this is causing me pain and I think about this all the time and I'm sure he hasn't even realized or given it a second thought. I usually have a lot of compassion for people, like if he needed to leave the relationship, I get it, but the timing still feels so awful, it still feels like I made a huge sacrifice for nothing. I feel like I want some kind of justice, but I know the healthy thing is to forgive him and move on.

So I thought I could track and that way Id prevent pregnancy and avoid getting on bc until his surgery that is now this month. I was told it was good way to avoid pregnancy if you didnt want to be on birth control. I figured I could handle that. We have literally had sex maybe three times at max in the last three months just trying to be cautious. I have two kids and my last baby I got car sick with.

Im still three days away from my period but I never get car sick expect when Im pregnant so that thought was eating me up so just to ease my mind I thought Id take a test.

My head wants to blame my husband because he was supposed to get V surgery over this past year and he put it off and of course when he finally gets it scheduled he had to reschedule. But two abortion back to back feels sick in my head because I know I could have prevented it and just got in bc in the mean time but besides just my mental health I didnt want my huband using me being on bc asa cop out.

I physically couldnt carry a baby anyways anymore because after my last baby, I was told my uterus is so thin they couldnt tell the difference from a uterus in the sack. The baby was in and that I was lucky she had even made it to 36 weeks without my uterus bursting. It was due to devious c-section I have a lot scar tissue and it has sheered out my uterus.

Im struggling with my decision to have an abortion. Im currently 6 weeks, and the next available appointment isnt until April 2nd (by then Ill be 9 weeks). The guilt is eating me alive, I have had a medical abortion 2 years ago and it was traumatizing! The pain I felt was extreme, and Ive vowed that I would do that again but here I am&

Ive been trying to justify my decision with the fact that Ive been experiencing severe hg and also suffer with HS (which is causing me immense pain due to the hormonal change), and as well as the thoughts that once it is gone Ill be okay again.. but my biggest excuse is that Im terrified to lose my freedom. 

Im 25 and I am in my second year of university while working full time..my spouse has landed a new job also and were excited to have a reliable income together. We are the type of people who are always doing something together, going to the movies randomly, attending concerts, clubbing, and just making spontaneous decisions..so when I found out I was pregnant, I felt like my world was coming to an end. Mind you, I do want children (we both do), but at this point in my life I feel like this is not the time :( I still want to travel the world while were young, because I know when we have children we will lose that freedom. Its killing me because Im terrified to experience that pain again, but also the guilt that we both want children. 

We have been talking about how we feel like were getting old meanwhile everyone around us has families (joking our kids wont have friends because everyone will be older). I feel so angry, and depressed that I cant properly decide on keeping the baby and settling to loose our freedom, or to abort and seek the life we wanted? Every day my decision changes like okay Ill keep it and accept the loss then the next Ill mourn the loss of my freedom and want the abortion. Im angry at my spouse because he doesnt understand the mental turmoil Im going through and is just all whatever you choose, its fine with me so Im left making this huge decision for our lives.

But I have so much fear and anxiety around it. I told my mom and grandma I was pregnant at 3 weeks right after I found out. They were very supportive and my mom and stepdad would adopt the baby. They have two young children (under 4 years old), so my baby would be in their age range. Im also due the week before next school year starts so my pregnancy doesnt affect my schooling. When I first found out, I was so scared and nervous, but loved my baby immediately. At 6 weeks I had an ultrasound and saw the little blob and I felt so much excitement, even though I knew I would never get to raise it. HOWEVER, the issue is, my partner does not want this child. In the beginning he told me I had to get an abortion and at 6 weeks when we made the appointment to go to Planned Parenthood, I couldnt take the first pill. I sobbed and sobbed and begged him to not make me do this and he did not care. We had many fights before that appointment and after that appointment where he told me Im an awful selfish person if I keep the child and how its not okay to gamble on a childs happiness, as it will be adopted by its biological grandmother and still have contact with its birth mother (me). Sorry this is kind of all over the place, but at 4 weeks I told him I was keeping it and so he yelled at me about how much he hated me then left. I freaked out so I told him if he comes back Ill get an abortion. After the appointment where I couldnt take the pills, he left again. And for those two weeks where he was gone I have never been more depressed and lonely. I just missed him so much and wanted a partner in this. My first trimester was really really really rough (nausea, vomiting, MAJOR cramping, flu, sinus infection, ear infections, fatigue). I just began doubting if I could really survive these next 7 1/2 months and that maybe an abortion is whats best. He agreed, as he thinks its selfish to develop the embryo into a child. He said if i get an abortion hell be there for me 24/7 and whenever I need and do whatever I need but Im very unsure. Lately, I constantly cry about loving my baby and he just corrects me saying its an embryo still. But at the same time, if I get an abortion we would be together, wed live together over the summer, wed go on trips&but I know Ill regret it for the rest of my life. My biggest dream has been to have children and I know I wont be able to raise this child, but Im so attached already. I know Ill look at my future children and wonder what if. He says my regret will pass but I adamantly dont think it will& Im unsure what to do. I feel like Im choosing short term suffering over long term suffering. I cant talk to my family about this because they are pro life, so they would not be thrilled with my actions. I just dont know what to do. My gut is telling me to keep my baby but Idk if i can handle the depression and loneliness for these next few months. But I also dont know if i can handle that regret for the rest of my life.

17 days ago I had a suction abortion, I was 6 weeks so early to handle what I had to do. 

Im 31 year old and I have a son who is 10 years old. 

I have a stable and supportive relationship with my boyfriend of almost 2 years and we live together in my houseboat. 

I had the abortion because my boyfriend wasnt ready yet (he is 23) and also the thought of having a baby on board is possible but not at all ideal. 
I did what I knew was best even tho I got warm fuzzy feelings towards the idea of being pregnant and having a love baby together. 

Since Im not on birthcontrol (I tried several times but I have a lot of side effects wich I dont want to have) I asked if he would want a vesectomy (excuse my English as it isnt my language) but he doesnt want that so we agreed on condoms. 

I made him clear that I want him to take the lead and the responsibility in this since he is the one that isnt ready to have kids, pointed out where I put the new package of condoms etc (within reach) 

Today (17 days after the abortion) we had sex for the first time, you probably hear it coming already; as he started cuddling and slides it in unprotected.. even tho I did warn him several times AND told him I dont want to have had this abortion for nothing as we have the risk of getting pregnant directly. 

I did push him out eventually and he is a very supportive and good lovely guy but this action of him gave me a lot of emotions so I wanted to talk about it in this group. 
Afterwards I did confront him as well about if he did think when he just pushed it in and he said he did but couldnt resist.

This unborn child was diagnosed with spina bifida at 20 weeks gestation. At 24 weeks, surgeons removed the child from her mothers womb and performed a surgery to repair her spinal cord. They then returned her to her mothers womb to complete the pregnancy. 

Was this child a person after being removed? Was she a non-person again after being put back in? 

Im particularly curious: suppose after being removed, the doctors determined the childs condition was more serious than anticipated and surgery offered little hope of improving the childs disability. Or, the doctors discovered another fetal abnormality inconsistent with life while the child was out. Should the mother still have the option to abort? If the mother did choose abortion at this point, why go the trouble of putting the child back in, aborting the child, then removing the child a second time as a corpse?

I'm literally crying my eyes out as I type this. I'm 39+6 today, I will be 40 weeks tomorrow. I have tried *everything* I can do get this baby out since 39 weeks. Now before I get lectured about being patient and letting the baby &amp; my body do what it needs to do, I want to say that unless you're in my situation, I don't want to hear that. 

I wanted to be induced at 40 weeks from the beginning as this as been a very difficult pregnancy and I *have* to work up until I give birth and I work as a housekeeper at a hospital, so I have a physically demanding job. I have accomodations and now I only clean one corridor during my shift but at this point, I'm so exhausted. Everything hurts. I have no stamina or energy anymore.

But at my last appointment with my OB, she didn't want to schedule an induction and wanted to discuss it later (this was at 37 weeks) I missed my 38 week appointment due to oversleeping and I missed my 39 week appointment which was yesterday due to the fact that I was having contractions and believed I was going into labor so I spent the time that should've been my appointment, at the hospital being evaluated for the contractions. The contractions stopped. So, it was false labor I guess. 

My next appointment is on the 19th but my doctor will be out of office and I'm meeting with her nurse instead. 

But I can't take this anymore. I just want relief. I'm sick of working while heavily pregnant. I just want to have my baby and start my leave. 

I'm going to try the miles circuit again tonight but if that doesn't work, I feel like my last resort is to go to L&amp;D and beg for them to induce me tomorrow at 40 weeks. I don't care about pitocin, emergency C-Sections, or anything else. I am literally losing my mind, I'm at my wit's end and I can't stop crying, I can't take this anymore 

If I didn't work or have an office job, then yes I'd be more patient, but with the nature of my job, it's just too much for me 

If I go to L&amp;D and request to be induced will they let me??? Please help. ","pregnant",7,"https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jan3ac/can_i_go_to_ld_and_ask_to_be_induced_40_weeks/"

My boyfriend (22) and I (25) always said that if an ""oops"" happened, abortion would be the planbut we also acknowledged that you never truly know how youll feel until you're in that situation. And now, here we are.

I finish my nursing degree in December, have a steady job managing social media (which isnt hard to do and pays well), and were planning to move to Florida next summer. My boyfriend still has at least 3-4 years left of school (he's studying to be a chiropractor or physical therapist), and while he wants to be a dad one day, he admits now is not ideal. That said, he has made it clear that its ultimately my choice, since its my body.

I am pro-choice, but the thought of going through an abortion puts me in such a dark place mentally that I genuinely dont think I could survive it. Its not that I feel ""ready"" to be a mombecause who ever really is?but I just cant see myself going through the process of an abortion. His mom initially said its my decision, but she supports abortion and even called me to basically push for it. My boyfriend, while not pressuring me, also knows keeping the baby isnt what he would have chosen.

I know having a baby right now would make things a lot harder, especially with our move coming up. But I also know I *can* do it. My job is remote, and Ill still be able to work once we move. Plus, Ive always dreamed of being a momliterally forever. I want to be a pediatric or NiCU nurse, and once we move, I plan to find a job in either PEDS or NICU nursing while continuing to work remotely. Having a baby while finishing school wasnt part of the plan, but its not impossible.

Whats weighing on me is knowing that this wouldnt be his choice, and that his mom has already made it clear where she stands. He also told me that if we keep the baby, he probably wouldnt be able to work while studying, and he wants to be able to give the baby everything. I dont want to ruin his future, but I also feel like Id be ruining myself if I went through with an abortion.

"2025-03-13",1741896873,"Feeling territorialanyone else?","Admittedly this isnt a huge deal, but for some reason it **really** bugs me. 

Im at 32 weeks, and friends have been giving gifts and signing them Aunt. For example, they sign their name as Aunt Jane in cards to me, or with a note to baby on the inside of a book. 

No one has asked me how I feel about it, and tbh it feels weird!! I love these people, but many of them live far away, and I would call them FRIENDS, not family. Im so excited for them to meet this baby and vice versa, but I dont think they will be the babys family. 

Obviously family isnt just blood or marriage. But not every friend is family. Some friends are just friends, even if they are very good friends!

I think it bugs me because while I know they are really writing this because they feel close to me, my baby is a separate person. I want this baby to be able to have clear boundaries and expectations with adults. I want them to understand what it means to have familywhat you should be able to expect from family, and what they should be able to expect from you. Friends and family might blur together sometimes, but if someone says theyre your family, kids should be able to form ideas of what that means. And if they decide one of my friends feels like an aunt to them, or we become so interdependent with someone that they become family, then great! But thats not where we are with these folks. 

I know were some time away from these things actually becoming an issue, and that likely it will never be an issue. But some of these folks I see once every 1-3 years. I dont want to show up at their house for a visit one day and have to explain to them then that no, Im not going to tell my child to call them aunt, and they shouldnt ask for that, either. 

My husband assures me this is very far from a big deal, and I know hes right, but it just feels very intrusive. Its like the emotional equivalent of someone touching your belly without asking. I know people already love this baby, and I love that, but they are their own little person, not just an extension of me. 

I know others will likely have their own opinions here. Please feel free to share, but Id also just ask up front that you dont feel the need to say there is a right vs wrong here or try to put down the feeling that Im having.

For some background, I have PCOS, so glucose is something we are concerned about. I went in for 2 hour glucose testing at 15 weeks, and my fasting level was normal as well as my 2 hour level. 

I went in for the routine one hour glucose test at 26 weeks and failed. Which, I was like okay no biggie, lots of people fail their one hour test. 

I went in for my three hour test, and I ended up high for my fasting level. I was a 103, but honestly I think that could be explained by the fact that fasting can make your glucose go up if you have PCOS (they had me fast for 12 hours this time whereas last time I only fasted for 8 hours), AND the girl taking my blood was CLEARLY new. She stabbed my arm like 6 times before moving over to the other arm, again stabbed me like 6 times, and finally had to go get someone else to do it. I REALLY dont do well with blood, and stress can cause your blood sugar to spike. 

My one hour came back and it was exactly 180, which is the cutoff. Then I passed my 2 hour and 3 hour with flying colors! Like, I was a 140 for my two hour (cutoff is 155), and I was a 118 for my three hour (cutoff is 140). 

My doctor calls me today and tells me that I have gestational diabetes. Uhm, WHAT??!!! What do you mean???? I passed my two hour and my three hour test???? And I was right at the cutoff for my one hour test. So they basically just qualified me because my fasting levels are off ? Even though that can be explained by my PCOS and the stress of being stabbed multiple times. And because my one hour test is EXACTLY on the 180 mark? 

I just feel like my doctors dont know what theyre talking about which makes me so nervous. And I was trying to talk to the nurse and she just kept saying your results were abnormal so you qualify and I was like but then why did I even do the two and three hour testing?? If you were going to qualify me from the one hour why didnt you do that the first time I failed my one hour test at 26 weeks?? They told me I had to go in to see how I did at 2 hours and 3 hours and that would determine whether I had it or not. And I passed both of those well within the normal range! 

I just really dont want to prick my finger four times a day if it doesnt seem necessary. I am really really really not good with blood. I of course will do whatever I need to do to protect my baby, but I just wish someone could explain to me how these numbers mean that I have gestational diabetes. I thought you could fail your one hour and still be fine, but apparently being exactly on the cutoff for one hour and being high for a fasting level is enough to qualify you?

I see a ton of posts about inductions being pushed for suspected large babies but not small, so I wanted to initiate the conversation and see if anyone has experience with this. I have had a totally normal healthy pregnancy so far, 31 years old pregnant with my first baby (a baby boy!) and underwent a routine 36 week US at my office (in retrospect I wish I declined this but you live and you learn) which showed that my baby's estimated fetal weight is 9th percentile, which is technically ""fetal growth restriction"". Of note he measured 24th percentile at prior ultrasound at 28 weeks. I have a repeat growth scan at 38 weeks 3 days and if he is still 9th percentile my OB is recommended induction between 38 to 39 weeks. I have had BPPs and dopplers to check blood flow which have all been totally normal, and I have a gut feeling that this is all seriously overkill. Also of note I was a small baby (6lb4oz at birth) and my husband and I are not big people (115lb pre pregnancy, husband is 150lb), and I have only gained 20-25 lbs during pregnancy. I am praying that he is 10th percentile or above at the growth scan so this is all a moot point, but if he does remain 9th percentile I am really inclined to decline induction if everything else remains stable as to not open the can of worms for cascade of intervention, but of course my first priority is baby's safety and would never want to put him at risk in doing so. Does anyone have any words or wisdom or experience this?!

Ill get straight to the point, me and my gf are expecting our little girl in May and I could not be anymore excited to be a girl dad! She is currently 7 months so its getting closer. 

Tonight we had a bad argument. My gf has been sooooo clingy to the point its suffocating me. I dont understand and never will understand pregnancy, all I could do is research but Ill never understand what it feels like. I applause all you women who sacrifice your bodies for our children.

Shes been so clingy up the point where if I wanna go to the gym, take care of errands, or go with my family, she gets upset. I tell her to go with me but the days she doesnt feel like doing anything, she stays and complains. Ive been going to the gym and dropping weight and feeling better and I work pretty much everyday because Im trying to save up for a new house for all three of us. Its non stop with me, Im always working just to save money and grind for us. 

Tonight, she started ranting to me that Im never there for her or she feels alone. Ive heard it before and I step up and when she asks me to massage her feet, back, shoulders, etc I do it with no complaints. I always check on her when Im at work and always asks if she needs anything before I get home. She once again, said that she feels like Im not affectionate when all I do is care for her. She literally thanked me the other day and said she appreciates me everyday because Im so good to her but tonight I hit a boiling point..

I regret it and said some ugly things because she started saying ugly things to me and absolutely HATE yelling especially since our little girl can hear now. But I feel soooo unappreciated when she complains about me daily and when Im doing the best I can for her.. and for us.. we never really fight but its just built up and built up to the point where I got mad tonight. She left and went to go stay with her sister. Another thing i talked to her about was keeping our business private. The last fight we had she went and told her mom& like we have these arguments but I never go and run and tell my parents.. its so frustrating. I love her and thank her everyday for carrying our little girl but I feel like she doesnt see how HARD Im trying for us. I come home from work and I cuddle with her and spend time with her and its not good enough.. still saying Im not affectionate. She began crying saying that Im not affectionate and everything Im literally trying my best here.. but anything I do isnt good enough. 

I admit it, theres times Im exhausted from a 13-15 hour shift and im not as affectionate.. but Im tired. Then I still massage her with NO COMPLAINING. I just needed this little rant and we have our baby shower in a few weeks.. its not easy.. its our first baby. Im trying my best to be understanding but sometimes it builds up..","pregnant",14,"https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jauxem/30_yo_male_needs_advice/"

First pregnancy, went in for my anatomy scan at 20 weeks and Im 23 now and just had another because the original one couldnt see her limbs well. Everything else was normal on the first one, she was a little small but nothing crazy either 35th or 25th percentile I cant remember. On this one I did earlier this week, yesterday, they told me her head measured below the 3rd percentile and her body was the 19th. Shes still active and OB said my belly is measuring fine and heart sounds great, but Im being referred to a high risk specialist to do a more detailed ultrasound.
Im terrified. Im so scared shes not growing enough and Ive done something wrong. Recently Ive been dealing with insane amounts of stress causing inappetence and heart palpitations, but Im not underweight and Im still able to force stuff down. Dr isnt concerned with my weight or calorie intake either since its only been the past couple weeks, but what can I do?? My partner is taking over the role of taking care of the family matter thats caused so much stress (basically out of nowhere they started talking to his ex again and she doesnt like me bc she wants the dog and I have been working with him and the day she came she wanted to have him and I said not today bc I was about to go the vet in a couple hours to see if he had cancer and I wanted him to come home and relax. He does have cancer and his surgery is next week. Anyway his brother and mom and dad all love her and she came to stay with his twin brother, and then they all got together at dinner without us and started talking shit about me, doing background checks on me, trying to tell my partner Ive lied about who I was bc they couldnt find my last job and one of my degrees on it and they dont see him as much so I must be controlling and manipulating him, meanwhile Im just trying to fuckin feed myself and nest. WHOLE BIG THING) so partner is going to tell them theyre either cut off or it all stops and they need to cut the ex off. He thought I was crazy at first bc inconceivable right?? but once it all came to light he was so pissed and apologized heavily for not supporting 100% in the beginning. BESIDE THE POINT. Its put my daughter at risk and I have been an absolute mess. 
Now what?? I havent gotten the call to schedule the referral yet, my childhood friend lost her first baby at 6 months because she also stopped growing, and I dont know what I can do? Has this happened to anyone and they went for the referral and everything was fine? Is it possible shes just small? My moms and my sisters babies were all tiny and we are all fine?

"2025-03-14",1741911316,"Today I had the most inappropriate, violating, dismissive, condescending care ever by an MFM who has never met me before."," WARNING  If you are near Long Island, NY and you ever have a pregnancy in which you need a referral to an MFM for possible high-risk factors, DO NOT EVER go to Cecilia Avila, part of Stony Brook Medicine. Every other doctor in this practice is wonderful. I got the bad egg this time due to bad timing and luck. 

Today I received the most inappropriate and VIOLATING care Ive ever received by a doctor (keep in mind this includes the team and surgeons that *misdiagnosed my appendicitis and left my appendix in by accident*, rendering me infertile and needing IVF in the first place. I wish I had looked up her reviews beforehand. Theyre dreadful. 

Today I was supposed to see an MFM one more time as a formality to make sure I can continue under the Midwives care for the remaining 1-4 weeks of my pregnancy and deliver with them. Thats not what happened. 

Would rate negative stars if I could. She came into the room without ever greeting me or introducing herself. Without ever having met me or reviewing my chart, told me she refuses to allow me back into the SBU midwives care although I have *no high-risk factors* at 36 weeks other than my age (45) and this being an IVF pregnancy. (The baby is in perfect health and is growing on schedule. I am in perfect health, BP is fine, no GD.)

She then told me my plan to go to 40 weeks is basically killing my baby, although Id already been cleared by another MFM in the practice to do exactly that with close monitoring. The statistics for placental issues after 39 weeks for IVF/older patients are in 17/1000 births as opposed to 11/1000 births in other pregnancies. Thats still only 1.7% vs 1.1% - yes, its 42% higher than younger natural pregnancies but LOOK AT THE NUMBERS. 

She went on a rant, speaking poorly of all of these IVF patients lately who dont want induction or to go before 40 weeks and want care other than MFM. Her opinion on IVF patients desire for the least invasive options that can *safely* be done was vile and simply& wrong. Im not a monster for wanting to be under the care of midwives that are still connected to the hospital system, particularly when an OB or MFM on call at the hospital can take over at any time if medically necessary. 

The icing on the cake was when she did a RECTAL SWAB INSERTION for Group B Strep with no forewarning of what she was about to do. I understand this can be part of the process, but a decent doctor would tell the patient what she was about to do first. Had I done this at my midwife appointment, the swab wouldve been self-administered and ONLY vaginal. Not even a hello, and she was shoving a Q-tip up my ass. 

Ive never been treated like this by any medical professional  in 45 years of life. She was dismissive, haughty, condescending, rude, and violating. She does not belong seeing patients. She should be a desk doctor only, reviewing paperwork or in a lab somewhere. Her knowledge of IVF pregnancies is outdated and shes not up on the current peer-reviewed science. She bases opinions on old information and is not interested in hearing new statistics. Checking her reviews, she has told patients to TMFR without doing any actual diagnostic testing!

An MFM sees patients who are high-risk and already frightened and anxious about their pregnancies and their babies health. To treat these patients with anything other than kind, gentle, compassionate care is negligent at best, and dangerous and detrimental to both mental and physical health.

Im not a Karen. I have never reported a doctor in all of the years Ive been alive. Ive seen MANY doctors. This is the first time I have ever been treated like this. I am filing a formal complaint with Patient Advocacy as well as the home office. I plan to contact the Board as well. It seems Im not the first patient who has had this experience - but I want to make sure I am the last. No one should ever be told theyre killing their baby or have an invasive test without warning. 

I honestly have no idea who will be handling my pregnancy here on out, and its so jarring. I was almost at the finish line.

"2025-03-13",1741909051,"Had my baby at 35 + 3.","Went into labor and delivery triage Thursday morning after 12 hours of intense lower pelvic pain and was told I was 2 centimeters and thinning, but after observation they sent me home for not progressing further. Went to work Friday and Saturday like normal, but woke up Sunday morning at 5am to horrid back pain. I went back into triage around 7:15 after not being able to relieve the pain through a hot shower, heat packs, or relaxing.

They get me all checked in, vitals taken, push fluids. and find Im now 4 centimeters and thinning more around 8:15. They move me to an actual delivery suite and tell me to get comfortable. Around 8:30 theyre finally ready to start an IV so I can get my epidural done afterwards per my birth plan, as they wont start one without the IV fluids. The pain has gotten so bad in my back that Im in tears, and my nurse leaves around 9 to track down the anesthesiologist because he hasnt shown up yet, and she tells me to call if I get the urge to poop.

Im texting my husband updates while he tries to hurriedly finish a few last minute things around the house to prepare for her, thinking that we have plenty of time and only live about 5 minutes away. About two minutes later, I get the urge and call, and the midwife does a quick check and tells me Im 10 centimeters and complete and its time to start pushing. Two nurses rush in with the cart while my midwife is still tying on her gown and gloving up, and tells me to start pushing if I need to before shes ready. My husband is rushing to the hospital&but baby girl comes out after 4 minutes of pushing and he runs in the door as theyre placing her on my chest.

Born on the 9th at 5lbs 1.6 ounces. But shes perfect and stays in room with me and husband. No breathing issues, no real health concerns. Im feeling immediate relief and two hours later I feel like I could already slowly walk a marathon around the hospital. Pain is minimal and my nurses are telling me how amazing it is that Im so okay. Were over the moon and bonding, though husband is sad about missing the birth by minutes.

Then I wake up at 2am that first night covered in sweat and shaking so badly I cant safely pick up my baby. Call the nurse, and I have a temp of 102 but no pain or other symptoms of anything. The nurses and midwife are stumped because aside from the fever they track over 2 days, Im perfectly fine. No stomach pain, minimal bleeding, no discomfort. They do rounds of blood work and even send me down for a CT scan the night of the 11th.

And find appendicitis. So I have my baby on the 9th and my appendix removed on the 12th. And after the recovery, our planned 2 day hospital stay turned into 5. But were home now and adjusting, and in a way it all feels like some weird fever dream, going from 4 to 10 centimeters in about an hour. Im in more pain from the surgery than the delivery, but baby is healthy and thriving and thats all that really matters.

I want to preface this by saying I did have dental issue prior to my first pregnancy but it was manageable at the time. This is a direct result of my pregnancy. Anyways I had my second baby last year (2 under 2) and one of the most disheartening things has been my teeth. I have to get dental implants because my pregnancy cost me my bottom molars on both side. During my pregnancy I had HG which made me severely anemic, malnourished, and stressed. I would grind my teeth at night, threw up at any time especially early morning, and I couldnt stomach tooth paste. I couldnt take my prenatal either because even after trying 7 different brands I would vomit to the point of bleeding after taking them. Which means my babies took the calcium they needed from me. On top of everything I was so depressed that I barely cared once I noticed my teeth literally cracking (was speaking out pieces of teeth). With this combination my teeth were destroyed with the latest being pulled last month. I hate to smile now because my teeth have cracks, chips, and holes in most of my teeth. I lost my job during my first pregnancy so I have basic dental care through medicaid which doesnt cover the work I need. I love my babies dearly but I didnt know it would cost me my smile in so many ways. Emotionally and mentally I barely want to smile and now its a physical reason that my smile feels horrible. Please take your prenatals, please push your doctors to check your levels to insure youre not deficient anywhere, and do remember that pregnancy is harsh. Never have a baby for any reason other than YOU wanting that baby because it can cost you in ways you never wouldve thought. I had my babies for me of course but the cost hit really fast.

So um. Nobody prepared me for the pain that comes with contractions. The pain will be different for everyone of course, but in my experience contractions started off like bad abdominal period cramps for a day, very tolerable. The following day.. they progressed to my back and it felt like someome was using all their force and swinging a baseball bat into my tailbone/lower back =5=« HOLY F!! No one prepares you for that. I just remember thinking God PLEASE help me!  and all you can do is shut your eyes as tight as they allow and groan through it. 

I finally went to the hospital that second night and next came the cervical check. The cervical check to me, felt like a sharp hot knife entering your vagina.. WTFFF. I instantly started sobbing and asked the nurse to please stop, and that i dont want to have a cervical check done. She told me she barely even went in but i was sobbing uncontrollably, i couldnt catch my breath, the pain was like nothing ive ever felt before. They had to convince me to get a cervical check with the help of fentanyl. Once I got the fentanyl, I was able to tolerate a cervical check. I was 6cm dilated. Thank you God for modern medicine! 

The pain absolutely wiped me out, I just wanted to sleep in between each contraction, my eyes would shut from all the pain and my body wanted me to fall asleep because it took every ounce of energy out of me. But then another contraction would beat you up awake again =5=«=-


My pain tolerance must be so low! I got the epidural shortly after being admitted... epidural = pure bliss.

I'm not high risk,  nor have I had any complications other than terrible pregnancy sickness.  

The anxiety is just horrible, I have stomach issues, even before pregnancy and I was warned the scar tissue could turn cancerous if I don't take care of myself so I already have a chance of dying it feels like.  (I've been puking stomach acid this while pregnancy, I know it's getting worse I can feel the pain from time to time) 

No matter what my bf thinks, I'm going to tell the Dr to deliver my baby that if any complications arise, save me before, baby.  We can have another kid. My mom can't have another me.  I never wanted to be a mom, so I had no intention of dying for a child I didn't want.

I'm worried my bf will hate me for saying that, but I've said since we met, I didn't want kids.  This pregnancy was not planned, and he's the ""God gave us this kid for a reason"" type of guy.  So, he probably would've left me had I went through with  the termination.  Of all the women out there PRAYING for a baby, why did it have to be ME that gets one??


Edit
He is not using me for a baby.  That's not what happened.  The condom broke, and I got pregnant.  I told him from the beginning that if I'd accidentally fall  pregnant, I wasn't sure if I'd keep it.  But, he proved to me that he isn't like my father was to me. He'll be a great dad.  We were together for a while before it happened, I know him like the back of my hand.  And he knows me like the back of his hand.  We never argued or fought once. We had disagreements, but it was settled quickly without any problems.  I wanted it to be us for a while longer before we had kids if we got to that point.

(I'm 25) and thought she was a lil odd when she started texting in it daily after the 3 of us hung out once for an hour this past NYE. Any who, I found out I was pregnant Feb 2nd and we had never spoke of babies up until I found out I was preggo. She got completely fixated on that and did everything she could to suddenly get pregnant shortly after. She would send messages almost nightly about how she just got 'creampied' and give like all these details of how she was keeping the semen inside to get preggo. And then suddenly she said she and her boyfriend had been trying for a while to get pregnant and it never worked..... Well she sent a positive test probably around 2 weeks ago and she found out when she was like 8 days pregnant and had booked an ultrasound the day of at PP. Freaked out because they couldn't see the baby (because she literally just got pregnant but for some reason lied and told them she was 4 weeks pregnant) and has just been fucking non stop ever sense. I caught her lying about her saying her boyfriend was 'actively' trying to get her pregnant for a while, because now that she is he's not excited because hes 23 and he said he wasn't planning to have a baby and basically just said she started getting crazy about it out of nowhere....... I shit you not she has been daily been sending messages EVEN AT 9 DAYS PREGNANT about having food aversions, nausea, all this stuff but then when she was worried that they didn't see anything at 8 days pregnant she admitted she hasn't had any symptoms so she was concerned that they were saying they didn't see any signs of a fetus. It's just been so weird. Every day she's been non stop and normally I would be excited to have someone to relate to but I feel like she is pushing it all so hard. I struggled so bad between weeks 6-9 and she just doesn't understand idk. I'm sure she's starting to have symptoms at 4 weeks, but every single day its something but then shes out doing a whoooooole bunch of stuff which I feel like contradicts what she says and I just find it hard to believe how authentic shes being about it all because shes just been weirding me out entirely honestly. every day she just talks about herself nonstop and will go on and on and on &amp; not pick up social cues of when to stop and sometimes its like overly detailed and TMI??? She once sent a photo of toilet paper after she wiped to show her discharge ?

We were all talking in the chat today and she of course is already just going on and on and on about how shes already created her baby registry and shes going to start sending it out and she sent it in the chat to my friend &amp; I, and she was just saying how excited she is etc and I responded saying I'm just nervous because its a complete life change and something I've obviously never done before (she hasn't either) and that i hope i will be a good mom etc and she responded this entire paragraph saying this"" sometimes being a mother isn't meant for everyone, you really have to consider if this is the right choice for you, it is going to be a life altering decision, and a addition to your life that once its here it is truly your responsibility. you are a very young girl and you already have a lot of animals, if you genuinely don't think being a mother is something your going to want to do for the next 16 years until they get their license, its okay to wait a bit longer. i don't want to stress you out but there are going to be sacrifices. this is legit the rest of your life that's going to be changed. god forbid they do a sport that you hate."" and i was honestly appalled by this message. She made me feel like i was SO out of line for saying I'm genuinely nervous to be a mother and i get anxious thinking about it sometimes. Like who are you to tell me that at all? Idk. The girl just rubs me wrong honestly. Or maybe I'm just a bitch.

She did break my water before but the cervix check hurt more than that. We got the epidural placed and all was well. I started feeling my right leg though, as well as contractions on that side of my stomach, and had to tell a nurse three times before she got the anesthesiologist to come back and look at it.

Not a big cuddler, best we get is sleeptime purring while she circles us like a hawk and begs for pets. She's mostly in our bedroom, where we plan to keep the baby stuff until we build the extra room that will hopefully serve as long term kid's room. The crib will have a breathable mesh net on top to keep her out and her litter box is hidden inside a cabinet (those nifty ones with a hole entrance just big enough for a cat that look like classic TV stands). Unless she does something totally horrible, I am not throwing her out. We will also have a portable crib for others rooms so no leaving them alone in bedroom without supervision.

I asked for an elective induction on my due date for my second pregnancy. I actually drove myself to the hospital and begged to be induced ha. They agreed (I guess labor and delivery was slow that day.) We tried a membrane sweep the week prior and nothing. I was just done being pregnant, I had a rough and painful (had to start leave from work a month earlier than expected because my hip pain was so bad I could barely walk) third trimester. Pregnancy was otherwise really healthy/ uncomplicated. Ive had one previous vaginal delivery (spontaneous labor at 39 weeks after membrane sweep). Relatively uncomplicated hospital birth (20hrs in labor, 30min pushing, second degree tear, normal recovery. I did have terrible back labor though but once I got the epidural I felt nothing).

My husband met me at the hospital and we had lunch and then walked over to L&amp;D. We got checked in and found out I was already 5cm dilated. Got started in pitocin and started having contractions. I BARELY felt the contractions though they felt like mild period cramps but could see them in the monitor. My husband and I happily hung out and watched tv for three hours (we joked it was the first date wed been on in months ha). 

After a few hours the contractions started to hurt a but more so I asked for an epidural. By the time i got the epidural they were pretty painful but i was able to breathe through it all. Epidural worked and dulled the pain a bit (not as strong as the one id had with my first delivery). Nurse checked my cervix (7cm now) and accidentally broke my water. 

I IMMEDIATELY felt the need to push/ excruciating pressure. She checked me again, lo and behold I was at 10cm. 

I pushed like 4 times and my healthy baby girl was born 8 minutes later. The midwife barely had time to get to the room. I didnt tear at all! They removed the epidural and I basically felt totally normal& 

Shockingly easy recovery, was out to lunch with friends a few days later& 

It felt like the epidural didnt work below my belly but honestly the pushing part was so fast it was fine. I also wonder if I didnt tear because I could feel everything& Anyways, I hope any future birth I may have goes exactly like this again.

From the time I was 17 I was told I'd never be able to have kids because of severe endometriosis and pcos and was absolutely devastated because I always knew I wanted babies seeing as I had helped raise babies since I was 12. Fast forward to 27 and finding out I was pregnant for the first time and crying so hard because it finally happened.  Unfortunately for my husband and I we lost our angel at 8 weeks and I felt like my whole world was crashing around us. It felt like there was our only chance after 7 years together struggling and hoping.  Then last year happened. Exactly a year after we lost our baby we found out we were pregnant again.  To say I was terrified would be an understatement always wondering if something would go wrong. Always looking to each appointment to make sure baby boy was ok. Every appointment we waited for the other shoe to drop. We just tried to enjoy the time we had while hoping everything would stay healthy.

They've been getting better in my 2nd trimester, however, I have a coworker who irritates theeee shiiiiit out of me. She's actually SO NICE, but she reeks of ""desperation""... I can't think of a different or better word... of wanting to ""fit in"" &amp; be a part of every conversation... its irritating.. we are at work, I'm inquiring about something work related &amp; she manages to squeeze in a comment regarding something outside of work.. just to say it... or just to have an interaction.. and the bosses have new rules now &amp; she sarcastically brings them up, OFTEN. Like okay, jokes old already &amp; I don't want to fake laugh, just bc i feel bad.. also, she was calling my baby ""peanie"" the entire first trimester.. just a horrid nickname..not cute..and in the sonogram, baby didn't even LOOK like a peanut.. if it did, call it peanut.. not peanie... bc wth is that? I asked her to stop. My aunt also called it peanut.. I literally asked, ""where does it look like a peanut?"" ... its annoying as shit.

Anyway, back to coworker (who I've known since hs.. we are in our mid 30s now)

Examples:
1. How's peanie? Idk...... good, I hope!
2. Go eat, you're eating for two now.... no, I'm not.. and I don't eat unless I feel hungry or it's been a while since I've eaten. Even so, just bc I feel a slight twinge of hunger, doesn't mean I have to go stuff my face.
3. When im walking away from my work station, ""don't forget to clock out &amp; not waste company time.. or you'll get fired"" (jokes old already! .) - ""don't forget to clock out before you use the bathroom"" - all sarcastic joking comments, and only she's laughing.. legit laughing.. and im like.. this isn't even funny to me.. enough already.. 
4. Talking about work related shit &amp; she wants to throw in, ""we need a girl day"" . . . Or some personal stressful detail about her life, COMPLETELY irrelevant from the work related shit im talking about.. not even a conversation starter, just legit one sentence. One comment. Just to say it.
5. Talking about food and how hungry she is ALL THE TIME and then comments about how good the food was or how bad it messed up her belly.. comments on it FOR HOURS throughout the workday.. I've turned into a ""that's crazy"" person.... &amp; a ""don't make eye contact"" person, otherwise, she's blurting out ""those empanadas were so good.. I want more"" ..... SO GET THEM! It's like why do you have to say something every single time i face your direction? Like idc!
6. I had a browning banana on my desk and she tells me, ""you better eat that before it goes bad.."" - I said i will if I want it, but if it goes bad, I'll toss it. I'm not afraid to throw food away if i need to.. I'm not a food hoarder and I don't eat every single moment I'm hungry or just bc food is in front of me. 
7. She thinks just bc I'm pregnant I'm supposed to be eating like a cow... I was telling her something about me and my bf eating and she inquires about my bf, ""he eats as much as you?""  - B%#$* !! first of all, I'm not heavy. I love my body, I think I'm pretty =% hot, &amp; I feel good about myself in a world where what we see online can make us feel like pure shit. Even if i was heavy, juicy,.... a voluptuous woman.. id still feel sexy. however, I do not look like I overeat.. at all. So that comment implies that just bc I'm expecting, I eat more than my 5""11 190lb weight lifting BF !? I can barely eat with all of my food aversions. I'm 5'3, always bloated in belly (prior to pregnancy) due to PCOS.. but to say that shit...  my blood boiled. The assumptions are crazy annoying. Just bc im pregnant, you're simply going to assume i cant control my food intake. Wth. 
8. She suffers from anxiety, I'm someone who worries here and there, has fears, like anyone else... especially as a FTM and possible complications etc. I was so nervous in the beginning of this pregnancy... and so she would make comments like, ""people like us"" or ""you know how our mind works"" ... associating me with an anxiety disorder. It's like she took my valid ass fears or worries.. and moments* of anxiety... to compare to HER &amp; associates with anxiety
9. Tells my worker (who trusts my pallet) that as long as she sits next to me, she's going to gain weight. (Again, not bc I'm heavy.. she just think bc I'm pregnant, I eat like a savage) mind you I have 2 meals a day bc so many food thoughts turn me off.) You're not about to blame me for my food recommendations*** &amp; if someone chooses to eat it.. and gains weight, ""blame her"" .. you're not cute or funny. Bc what you're saying isn't even true! If it were true, it wouldn't bother me.

All this shit IRKS me &amp; I can't control the annoyed feelings.

I was diagnosed with a short cervix and SCH almost a week ago after having lots of pink and brown discharge/mucus with blood clots along with some mild cramping. I went to the ER (mind you this was my third doctor visit in a week to find out whats wrong.) They spotted a SCH that had some blood and debri, they assured me that was where the extra nasty discharge was probably coming from. They told me that should pass on its own. They then noticed how short my cervix was. It was at a 2.3-2.5. They kept me overnight with the TOCO machine to spot any early contractions and had me on progesterone all night to see if it helped. The high risk doctor measured my cervix the next morning and it was a 3.1. He was more confident that things were better but still wanted to follow up in a few days to check on things. They prescribed me progesterone and Ive been on it for 5 days now. I went back to the doctor today for a follow up. My cervix is measuring at 1. They are assuming the progesterone wasnt doing so well and are highly suggesting a cerclage. Ive took it very easy the past few days and missed a bunch of work and been on bed rest (my decision.) Im not sure what caused the cervix to get that bad so quickly. Im going to be admitted again tonight. They are going to put me back on the toco machine to check for contractions and put me on more medication tonight to prepare for surgery tomorrow. God willing. The doctor told me she has seen a lot of success with cerclages but she has also been there for cases that still had a bad outcome where they went into pre term labor and couldnt stop it regardless of the cerclage. She made sure I knew that if that were the case, the baby wouldnt survive and at this point they are definitely concerned of that happening. They are going to do anything preventative they can.

In your experience, is it worth it, does it increase stress and costs unnecessarily, and does it push for interventions that aren't needed/scans that end up getting false positives? 

I'm labeled high risk at 39 as a FTM who conceived through IVF (unexplained, but very likely cervical issues). I agreed to MFM care in my first trimester because I was struggling with anxiety and happy for any additional assuring appointments. But at 22 weeks, anxiety is gone and everything is going perfectly with me and baby. I have a baby echocardiogram scheduled for 3 weeks from now, and apparently I'd start to see MFM every 2 weeks (!!) not long after that, in addition to all my OB appointments. 

I spoke with my normal GP today, who specializes in women's reproductive health, and she strongly recommended I consider bowing out of MFM care. This is given my zero indicated risk and the high likelihood that they would induce me (they told me they'd induce me before my due date) and overall push for scans and tests that often give false positives. 

She said MFM really pushes for babies to be born alive and early (pushing induction) vs. thinking about the baby's overall start in life (being able to nurse, breathe well, fight infection, etc). She sees the difference in newborn response and overall health whereas MFM and OB don't treat babies after birth, and the differences she sees between babies born 36-39 weeks vs. 40-41 weeks (especially for healthy women who eat, move, and have supportive communities) is huge. 

It's got me thinking! Anyone else avoid MFM or even extra OB intervention to avoid induction or being pressured toward induction (or just lots of expensive appointments/scans that aren't needed)?

For my first 2 children we found out the sex of our babies at birth, so I think I was just too focussed on actual labour and birth to be thinking about the sex! We decided to find out this time now but my husband loves making the calls when theyre born to tell everyone so were keeping it a secret just the 2 of us which is really exciting, also why I cant speak to anyone about it! 

We have 2 perfect boys, for my first I didnt really care for my second I so wanted another boy, I have a sister so I wanted the same sex bond I grew up with and I was so happy for my son that we had a boy. We always knew wed have a third. This time I dont really know how I feel, I love having boys and I know Ill adore having another one, my youngest wants a boy. It occurred to me this week that this is our last ever baby, so if it is another boy I will never experience having a daughter and everything that comes with that, my eldest really wants a girl. 

Id never thought about it too deeply before but it hit me a bit today that one way or another that tomorrow we will know for sure what our family will be and thats a bit overwhelming. Having never found out in pregnancy before I didnt realise how utterly nerve wrecking it is! I cant think about anything else, please tell me Im not the only one! I dont even have a real gut instinct, I think it will be a boy because I think thats all my husband makes but at every scan so far we come away thinking maybe its a girl.

Im having my c section in 7 days and Im excited.

"2025-03-13",1741899475,"Newly pregnant after TTC for a year, an ectopic, and diagnosed infertility","I guess I need somewhere to spill my news of excitement and anxiety. 

My husband and I decided to TTC last year this month and we got pregnant in July, only for it to end with an ectopic pregnancy rupturing and I lost my right fallopian tube. I was diagnosed with stage 3 endometriosis during this surgery (which I never knew I had) and it had eaten through my entire fallopian tube, causing the ectopic. It was covering my ovaries and all over my insides. After my ectopic, we continued TTC with times sex and using LH strips and BBT monitoring. 

After my ectopic, I started having really short luteal phases (7-8 days) several months in a row. After pushing my OBGYN, they finally decided to run CD21 progesterone labs and discovered that my progesterone was too low to confirm ovulation each month. They tested me three months in a row and confirmed I had stopped ovulating on my own. That combined with my stage 3 endo diagnosis, I was diagnosed with infertility. 

In January, they did an endometriosis excision surgery and found that my other tube was completely clear (yay!). They ran progesterone labs again the following month and I still was not ovulating. They decided to put me on Letrozole 5mg. 

I hit one year TTC this month and my husband and I took a trip to France. I didnt have my hopes high because Im so used to disappointment and seeing negatives, but the night I got home, on 10DPO, I got a positive. 

I immediately took a digital and it came back positive too. I cant believe my first cycle on 5mg Letrozole actually worked!! I am cautiously excited because the protocol following an ectopic is to get bloodwork every 48 hours until I can get a 6 week placement scan to ensure it is not ectopic again. I have started my bloodwork and my 6 week appointment is scheduled. 

I am terrified of losing this baby that we have tried for for so long. I am waiting for the other shoe to drop and I cant help but feel terrified that this baby wont make it, despite really healthy first bloodwork.

Im currently 9 weeks and 4 days pregnant with my first baby. After my first prenatal appointment, I received unexpected news from my employer that we need to return to the office after nearly three years of working remotely. I was devastated because I had hoped to work from home during my pregnancy and through my babys first year, but here we are.

I spoke with my doctor about it, and she gave me some great advice to make the transition easier, like treating myself to lunch nearby, listening to my favorite podcast on the commute, and finding small ways to make the experience more pleasant. That helped me mentally prepare, but Im still struggling with first-trimester fatigue, sleepiness, food aversions, and all the fun symptoms that come with early pregnancy. I have been told things get better in the second trimester, so Im hopeful.

Now, I have the option to work either:

* 5 days a week, 8 hours a day
* 4 days a week, 10 hours a day with 3-day weekends

I would love to hear from others who have worked a flex schedule while pregnant. For context, I'm a software developer. My commute would be 45 - 60 minutes. Would working four longer days be worth it for the extra day off, or would the longer shifts be too exhausting? I understand that everyone is different and experiences may vary.

I plan on talking to my doctor tomorrow but I am struggling with my anxiety. 

I am currently 20w along with my second pregnancy. 

I first was great till the birth. Had him at 39+4 and he was semi big at 8lb 1oz. He also was sunny side up (nose facing my pelvis vs nose facing tail bone like normal) And for anyone that doesn't know that means that the widest part of the baby head is coming out first instead of the cone part of the head which is made to come out first. 

Him being born in that position caused me to tear in 3 locations all needing stitches and all VERY painful. I had the Epidural for my labor which also was a very long process for me as well but it only semi worked. i could feel contraction pain in my tail bone and my left butt cheek... they of course turned it off for the pushing part which lasted 2 1/2 hours for me. 

During my birth i was crying and saying i couldn't handle it anymore, i was in so much pain i wanted to quit. which i technically did as i stopped pushing myself though my body still naturally pushed and they had to help pull him out of me once his head came out. 

I feel as though I'm sort of traumatized and I'm having so much anxiety about giving birth again. I've told my husband that I am considering a C section as the cons of a c section sound way more worth it to me than going through a 24 hour labor, and 2+ plus hours of pushing and feeling like I'm giving up. 

I am aware a C section has a several month healing process, I'm aware of how the procedure works. What I maybe want is hearing other peoples experience.

I had been on birth control for 20 ish years and stopped taking my pill around Christmas time. I had my regular withdraw bleed on Jan 2. My husband and I both assumed it would take 3-6 months for my body to regulate and start normal cycles again. Towards the very end of January I started to feel like I was about to start my period but never did. This feeling lasted 2-3 weeks, no period, but I tested very positive on Feb 23.

I called my dr and we went to our first appointment yesterday. He seemed quite discouraged, and said that our baby was only measuring about 5-6 weeks when he felt it should be closer to 8-9. He was not able to detect a heartbeat, but has scheduled us to come back in on the 24th for a repeat ultra sound. 

This is our first baby, so we arent sure what to expect or think. I am convinced that I ovulated at the very end of January/early February, we werent really trying yet so I have to admit I wasnt tracking anything. Im just going by the clear stringing stuff that was coming out of me = sorry if TMI, but it was def the egg white discharge

 My honest feelings are telling me they are going off my last period which wasnt even a period to assume how far along we should be - which I just dont think is accurate. I feel like the 5-6 week mark is correct, in which case our baby is right on track. I have had 0 spotting this entire time btw.

What are the chances of seeing a heartbeat at that stage through a vaginal ultra sound? Should we be worried or does this sound okay? I know the worst thing to do is stress, just wondering if there is anything else I could be doing to find out if everything is going as it should be??

He's cooking, cleaning , doing laundry, disposing garbage waste,and shopping grocery for me along with a very demanding research job which continues even beyond 9am-5pm.

I was so moved by seeing burning signs on his hands that came from cooking in a very small apartment where we're living now, I stepped forward to help him in cooking.

I've seen him sacrificing his meals for me and eating in the middle of long nights to make sure he's feeding himself well to take the extra responsibilities of this really tough time. This melt my heart =

I am skilled in handling household chores that includes almost everything, I am contributing in finding spices, deciding menus, arranging ingredients for the menu,he is cleaning dishes that he always hated to do.

Love in a relationship/marriage need not always be showy for my husband but I feel, love lies in little gestures like these. I am so grateful to God for sending a gem = in my life.=O","pregnant",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jbbtj9/husband_appreciation_post/"

I am 23 weeks pregnant, due first week of July. I work full time at the same company for a 1 year and a half now. My husband and I are struggling with rent/expenses and I fear we may need to move to my families house (temporarily until we decide where we want to live after baby is born)  to help financially but also when baby comes for extra family help since this will be my first baby.

Some insight on our housing - we rented a house with a roommate last July as we had no idea that we would be having a baby this year- our roommate left to the military a month back and we are just struggling in general to keep everything up before our lease ends in July. (My birth month). I want to move to my parents asap but I am still working and do not want to quit because then I won't get my maternity leave. (I am in California). Are there any benefits I can apply to in my situation? Would I qualify for unemployment due to relocation needs + being pregnant?  or try to get Maternity leave early? So we can at least be able to pay our car insurance, car payment, phone bills, etc bills while we move to my parents? I fear 1 paycheck (my husbands) will not be able to cover all our expenses.

Some backstory, we are recent friends. Less than a year. We started hanging out because we have daughters around the same age and have similar interests. She has started to confide in me about her own infertility journey pretty recently into our friendship, maybe around 4 or 5 months ago. She recently had her first failed round of IVF, that she said she was disappointed but not surprised by because she has had so many losses in the past. All of her fertilized eggs are boys and she has also talked about how she has been worried about having a boy after wanting a sister for her daughter. 

Im currently pregnant with my third child and its a boy and I havent told her. I havent seen her in about a month but we have been hanging out while Ive been pregnant and Ive worn baggy clothes all winter. Ive been very very depressed this whole pregnancy. I just barely told my family a month ago (meaning they eventually told me they could tell I was pregnant and so I had to fess up that I am). I told a different friend only a few weeks ago also because I couldnt hide my belly anymore. I only told my extended family last week. I understand people closer to me may feel like I was withholding something from them or feel awkward about the times we have spent together and them not knowing Im pregnant, but Ive truly been so very depressed this whole time, crying myself to sleep and contacting the suicide hotline multiple times. Which has honestly made me feel worse because I have this friend who is trying so hard to have another baby and here I am being depressed while pregnant.

I want to see this friend again but I have no idea how to tell her now. She just barely had her first failed round of her boy embryo and is trying again next month.

I was heavily relying on my ex for both emotional support but also just to make me feel less lonely.

I know he has his own life to lead and hes said himself he cant be there 24/7 but does want to be involved, then backed off about 2/3 weeks ago. I have reached out but was brushed off, again it was a me problem, but if Im not healthy then baby isnt safe.

I want to be comfortable around him for the birth but also afterwards. I dont think Ill want a practical stranger around me when Im in labour or even in the weeks/months following the birth. 
The fact he is aware that hes the only person I really have right now but is stepping away is also making me think will he do this to the baby.  Can I really trust him to be the best dad. I just want to build a friendship now, maybe initially I thought we could work on us but not now. 

For reference were late 30s early 40s he already has older children (young adults) this is my first but had previous miscarriages. I am financially stable enough to do it alone but just struggling with everything and him having stepped back Im feeling completely isolated. As I said I do have friends I can rely on but they have their own lives (jobs/kids/families etc)

Is it unreasonable to expect baby dad to be involved with me throughout the pregnancy?  Am I expecting too much to build a friendship or even expect him to support me right now?  I dont feel comfortable having him at the appts now or even asking for support when I had a scare. Baby seems to be ok its me thats not doing great. 

We got into a huge fight when I told him that I didnt want him to come along to my next appt and that from now on I was going to do it alone. I would just inform him of updates if there was issues.  That if he couldnt offer the support I needed then we would have to reassess his coming along and also the birth and beyond. I would honestly rather be alone than have him around right now. He just said theres no reason for us to be friends but he does want to know and be there for appts. He isnt getting my view that its my body and if I feel like he will be a stranger then it will be me who decides when he can visit and when he can attend the appts or hospital after birth. 

Maybe I was being too needy, maybe I was expecting too much.  But when I discovered I was pregnant I wasnt expecting to have this emotional turmoil, or to have such a high risk pregnancy. But I also feel he should have been clearer from the start about his boundaries. ","pregnant",2,"https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jargtm/pregnant_to_my_ex/"

If responding quickly and lovingly to a child's distress in the day is important, why is it somehow less important just because the sun is down?

After all, it's nearly universally agreed upon that we should not completely ignore our child's fear, anxiety or emotional distress. Doing so we term negligence. This is still true even if we start by ignoring our child's distress for 5 minutes and gradually increase the duration over time until we ignore their cries completely. Why is it okay to do this at night?","changemyview",76,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jay4cq/cmv_sleep_training_is_ultimately_a_choice_to/"

"2025-03-14",1741963333,"Positive MA experience - 10w 0d","Using a throwaway for this one just in case. Although every MA is different, I want to share my story in hopes it will help others in a similar situation.

I discovered I was pregnant on Feb 26th; I'd had what I thought was a light period on January 29th-30th-31st, but it turns out that must have been implantation bleeding. I thought I was only 10 days late for my period based on the timing of that bleed, but it turns out I was much further along. I hadn't had many symptoms except for very sore breasts, some tiredness and loss of appetite, all of which I tend to get before my cycle anyway, so I didn't clue in right away.

I'm in a solid, loving relationship, but we just aren't currently in a situation to add to our family. I have a young child from my previous relationship, and we live in a fairly modest apartment, and for many other reasons it just wouldn't be right to add to the family right now. 

I was a bit panicked when I found out I was pregnant, but my partner was incredibly supportive and understanding. I called my doctor the same day and was referred to our local hospital which has a program for women seeking termination. My partner brought me to the appointment, which was on Wednesday of this week. I'm based in Canada and so it was a very calm and non-judgmental environment; I'm grateful to the doctor and nurse who walked me through my options and explained everything to me.

I was given an ultrasound and blood test the same day and they determined I was at exactly 10 weeks and 0 days, the cutoff for using medical termination in my province. They mentioned I could either schedule a surgical termination for the following week, or do the medical termination as long as I was willing to take the first pill that day. I decided on the medical because I wanted to end the pregnancy as soon as possible - my last pregnancy and birth process were extremely traumatic, and being pregnant again was giving me nightmares and flashbacks, so I couldn't handle the thought of waiting any longer.

Timeline:

6:00 pm Wednesday: took the mifepristone dose as directed. Had some very mild cramping starting about two hours later, which continued the following day.

1:00 pm Thursday: developed a headache, had some additional cramping and mildly upset stomach through the rest of the afternoon.

6:00 pm: took 10 mg ketorolac with a small amount of food.

6:45 pm: took 4 Misoprostol tablets in the cheek for 30 minutes as directed, washed down with water afterwards.

9:00 pm: started having some mild cramping which came in waves, slight chills. Very mild nausea which didn't last. Watched TV with partner and just tried to relax.

10:00 pm: started having some light spotting, cramps continuing. Cramps felt like my worst period day, nothing too major. Chills and started to have diarrhea.

10:45 pm: listened to an audiobook and went to sleep.

11:30 pm: woke up to a strange sensation, felt almost like my hands weren't attached to my body. Felt something shift in my lower abdomen, then a rush of fluid. Fortunately I was wearing heavy duty period undies in addition to a pad already and had no leakage. Went to the bathroom expecting pure blood but discovered it was pink tinted fluid which I assume was water breaking. Pad completely saturated. Pain very minimal.

As soon as I sat down on the toilet I felt something drop out. Had the sensation of needing to push, did so and a much larger clump came rushing out, along with quite a bit of blood. Peeked into the toilet and could see a ring shaped clot, and noticed a light pink thing partially submerged in the blood. It was not pleasant to see and I could tell it was part of a leg/lower torso of the embryo, extremely small but unmistakable.

Had a bit of a cry. Said I was sorry. Remembered what some of the other women have said on here about their babies becoming part of the water. I did not want to be pregnant, but I couldn't help but have feelings about it. I stayed for a while before saying goodbye and flushing.

1:30 am: woke up again, mild cramping and passed some more clots. Took a second ketorolac. Came back to bed and fell asleep easily.

6:00 am: woke up at my normal time, immediately felt different than I'd been feeling for the last few weeks. Breasts still a little sore but pain noticeably reduced from how they had been feeling prior. Did not have the morning upset stomach, and was able to enjoy a coffee (I'd been having aversion to it for about three weeks). Actually had energy as opposed to feeling extremely fatigued. Had moderate amount of blood on the pad and a few tiny clots when going to the bathroom, similar to a day 2 period.

10:30 am (present): cramps have almost completely subsided, have not needed more ketorolac. Ate some breakfast. Still have what is similar to a day 2 period. Energy is much higher than it normally is at this time of the morning.

I will still need to monitor for unusual bleeding, signs of infection, or increasing pain, and will need a follow up to confirm everything has passed, but ultimately the process was not what I expected. I originally worried that 4 Misoprostol wouldn't be sufficient, given that I was 10 weeks along and I've seen stories on here of women needing double the dose. I was worried it wasn't working initially as it took quite some time for the bleeding to start.

For anyone facing this situation right now: just know that you aren't alone. You are doing what is best for your body, and if you aren't ready to give up everything for a baby it means you're doing the right thing for your baby too. Sending healing thoughts and wishes to all of you who are reading this and feeling scared - you can do this if you need to.","abortion",3,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jb5i23/positive_ma_experience_10w_0d/"

Some backstory, we are recent friends. Less than a year. We started hanging out because we have daughters around the same age and have similar interests. She has started to confide in me about her own infertility journey pretty recently into our friendship, maybe around 4 or 5 months ago. She recently had her first failed round of IVF, that she said she was disappointed but not surprised by because she has had so many losses in the past. All of her fertilized eggs are boys and she has also talked about how she has been worried about having a boy after wanting a sister for her daughter. 

Im currently pregnant with my third child and its a boy and I havent told her. I havent seen her in about a month but we have been hanging out while Ive been pregnant and Ive worn baggy clothes all winter. Ive been very very depressed this whole pregnancy. I just barely told my family a month ago (meaning they eventually told me they could tell I was pregnant and so I had to fess up that I am). I told a different friend only a few weeks ago also because I couldnt hide my belly anymore. I only told my extended family last week. I understand people closer to me may feel like I was withholding something from them or feel awkward about the times we have spent together and them not knowing Im pregnant, but Ive truly been so very depressed this whole time, crying myself to sleep and contacting the suicide hotline multiple times. Which has honestly made me feel worse because I have this friend who is trying so hard to have another baby and here I am being depressed while pregnant.

I want to see this friend again but I have no idea how to tell her now. She just barely had her first failed round of her boy embryo and is trying again next month. Im worried I messed up by not telling her earlier, but I also hadnt told a single soul until very recently. Do I explain that part to her she she doesnt think I was lying to try to spare her feelings?

I asked for an elective induction on my due date for my second pregnancy. I actually drove myself to the hospital and begged to be induced ha. They agreed (I guess labor and delivery was slow that day.) We tried a membrane sweep the week prior and nothing. I was just done being pregnant, I had a rough and painful (had to start leave from work a month earlier than expected because my hip pain was so bad I could barely walk) third trimester. Pregnancy was otherwise really healthy/ uncomplicated. Ive had one previous vaginal delivery (spontaneous labor at 39 weeks after membrane sweep). Relatively uncomplicated hospital birth (20hrs in labor, 30min pushing, second degree tear, normal recovery. I did have terrible back labor though but once I got the epidural I felt nothing).

My husband met me at the hospital and we had lunch and then walked over to L&amp;D. We got checked in and found out I was already 5cm dilated. Got started in pitocin and started having contractions. I BARELY felt the contractions though they felt like mild period cramps but could see them in the monitor. My husband and I happily hung out and watched tv for three hours (we joked it was the first date wed been on in months ha). 

After a few hours the contractions started to hurt a but more so I asked for an epidural. By the time i got the epidural they were pretty painful but i was able to breathe through it all. Epidural worked and dulled the pain a bit (not as strong as the one id had with my first delivery). Nurse checked my cervix (7cm now) and accidentally broke my water. 

I IMMEDIATELY felt the need to push/ excruciating pressure. She checked me again, lo and behold I was at 10cm. 

I pushed like 4 times and my healthy baby girl was born 8 minutes later. The midwife barely had time to get to the room. I didnt tear at all! They removed the epidural and I basically felt totally normal& 

Shockingly easy recovery, was out to lunch with friends a few days later& 

It felt like the epidural didnt work below my belly but honestly the pushing part was so fast it was fine.

They've been getting better in my 2nd trimester, however, I have a coworker who irritates theeee shiiiiit out of me. She's actually SO NICE, but she reeks of ""desperation""... I can't think of a different or better word... of wanting to ""fit in"" &amp; be a part of every conversation... its irritating.. we are at work, I'm inquiring about something work related &amp; she manages to squeeze in a comment regarding something outside of work.. just to say it... or just to have an interaction.. and the bosses have new rules now &amp; she sarcastically brings them up, OFTEN. Like okay, jokes old already &amp; I don't want to fake laugh, just bc i feel bad.. also, she was calling my baby ""peanie"" the entire first trimester.. just a horrid nickname..not cute..and in the sonogram, baby didn't even LOOK like a peanut.. if it did, call it peanut.. not peanie... bc wth is that? I asked her to stop. My aunt also called it peanut.. I literally asked, ""where does it look like a peanut?"" ... its annoying as shit.

Anyway, back to coworker (who I've known since hs.. we are in our mid 30s now)

Examples:
1. How's peanie? Idk...... good, I hope!
2. Go eat, you're eating for two now.... no, I'm not.. and I don't eat unless I feel hungry or it's been a while since I've eaten. Even so, just bc I feel a slight twinge of hunger, doesn't mean I have to go stuff my face.
3. When im walking away from my work station, ""don't forget to clock out &amp; not waste company time.. or you'll get fired"" (jokes old already! .) - ""don't forget to clock out before you use the bathroom"" - all sarcastic joking comments, and only she's laughing.. legit laughing.. and im like.. this isn't even funny to me.. enough already.. 
4. Talking about work related shit &amp; she wants to throw in, ""we need a girl day"" . . . Or some personal stressful detail about her life, COMPLETELY irrelevant from the work related shit im talking about.. not even a conversation starter, just legit one sentence. One comment. Just to say it.
5. Talking about food and how hungry she is ALL THE TIME and then comments about how good the food was or how bad it messed up her belly.. comments on it FOR HOURS throughout the workday.. I've turned into a ""that's crazy"" person.... &amp; a ""don't make eye contact"" person, otherwise, she's blurting out ""those empanadas were so good.. I want more"" ..... SO GET THEM! It's like why do you have to say something every single time i face your direction? Like idc!
6. I had a browning banana on my desk and she tells me, ""you better eat that before it goes bad.."" - I said i will if I want it, but if it goes bad, I'll toss it. I'm not afraid to throw food away if i need to.. I'm not a food hoarder and I don't eat every single moment I'm hungry or just bc food is in front of me. 
7. She thinks just bc I'm pregnant I'm supposed to be eating like a cow... I was telling her something about me and my bf eating and she inquires about my bf, ""he eats as much as you?""  - B%#$* !! first of all, I'm not heavy. I love my body, I think I'm pretty =% hot, &amp; I feel good about myself in a world where what we see online can make us feel like pure shit. Even if i was heavy, juicy,.... a voluptuous woman.. id still feel sexy. however, I do not look like I overeat.. at all. So that comment implies that just bc I'm expecting, I eat more than my 5""11 190lb weight lifting BF !? I can barely eat with all of my food aversions. I'm 5'3, always bloated in belly (prior to pregnancy) due to PCOS.. but to say that shit...  my blood boiled. The assumptions are crazy annoying. Just bc im pregnant, you're simply going to assume i cant control my food intake. Wth. 
8. She suffers from anxiety, I'm someone who worries here and there, has fears, like anyone else... especially as a FTM and possible complications etc. I was so nervous in the beginning of this pregnancy... and so she would make comments like, ""people like us"" or ""you know how our mind works"" ... associating me with an anxiety disorder. It's like she took my valid ass fears or worries.. and moments* of anxiety... to compare to HER &amp; associates with anxiety
9. Tells my worker (who trusts my pallet) that as long as she sits next to me, she's going to gain weight. (Again, not bc I'm heavy.. she just think bc I'm pregnant, I eat like a savage) mind you I have 2 meals a day bc so many food thoughts turn me off.) You're not about to blame me for my food recommendations*** &amp; if someone chooses to eat it.. and gains weight, ""blame her"" .. you're not cute or funny. Bc what you're saying isn't even true! If it were true, it wouldn't bother me.

All this shit IRKS me &amp; I can't control the annoyed feelings.

Im currently 9 weeks and 4 days pregnant with my first baby.

I was devastated because I had hoped to work from home during my pregnancy and through my babys first year, but here we are.

I spoke with my doctor about it, and she gave me some great advice to make the transition easier, like treating myself to lunch nearby, listening to my favorite podcast on the commute, and finding small ways to make the experience more pleasant. That helped me mentally prepare, but Im still struggling with first-trimester fatigue, sleepiness, food aversions, and all the fun symptoms that come with early pregnancy. I have been told things get better in the second trimester, so Im hopeful.

Now, I have the option to work either:

* 5 days a week, 8 hours a day
* 4 days a week, 10 hours a day with 3-day weekends

I would love to hear from others who have worked a flex schedule while pregnant. For context, I'm a software developer. My commute would be 45 - 60 minutes. Would working four longer days be worth it for the extra day off, or would the longer shifts be too exhausting? I understand that everyone is different and experiences may vary.

Im almost 15 weeks now, so still pretty early in the grand scheme of things, and Im really struggling with my body. 

Im 57 and my comfortable weight when Im eating well and working out is around 135 (Im small framed and dont carry much muscle, so this is not too thin on me). The constant hormones and stress of IVF bumped me up to 145 prior to this pregnancy. 

Now Im fresh into the second trimester and have already gained another 10 pounds. As of this morning, Im 155. My appetite has definitely increased and Im not depriving myself. 

I feel like I dont look pregnant, just chubby and I feel frumpy. My bump is not prominent yet and just looks like extra belly fat (and some of it definitely is=). My arms, hips, thighs, and boobs have already grown a lot too. None of my clothes fit me right now and nothing I try on makes me feel good.

Ill circle back to state that I am SO grateful to finally be pregnant. If it takes me gaining 100 pounds to bring this baby into the world, I absolutely will. But Im just not feeling like myself. 

Is anyone else feeling the same? When did your clothes start to not fit you anymore?

"2025-03-14",1741964366,"Should I break up with MFM? (Labeled ""high risk"" because of IVF and 39, but textbook pregnancy so far)","Curious for this group's thoughts on MFM. In your experience, is it worth it, does it increase stress and costs unnecessarily, and does it push for interventions that aren't needed/scans that end up getting false positives? 

I'm labeled high risk at 39 as a FTM who conceived through IVF (unexplained, but very likely cervical issues). I agreed to MFM care in my first trimester because I was struggling with anxiety and happy for any additional assuring appointments. But at 22 weeks, anxiety is gone and everything is going perfectly with me and baby. I have a baby echocardiogram scheduled for 3 weeks from now, and apparently I'd start to see MFM every 2 weeks (!!) not long after that, in addition to all my OB appointments. 

I spoke with my normal GP today, who specializes in women's reproductive health, and she strongly recommended I consider bowing out of MFM care. This is given my zero indicated risk and the high likelihood that they would induce me (they told me they'd induce me before my due date) and overall push for scans and tests that often give false positives. 

She said MFM really pushes for babies to be born alive and early (pushing induction) vs. thinking about the baby's overall start in life (being able to nurse, breathe well, fight infection, etc). She sees the difference in newborn response and overall health whereas MFM and OB don't treat babies after birth, and the differences she sees between babies born 36-39 weeks vs. 40-41 weeks (especially for healthy women who eat, move, and have supportive communities) is huge. 

It's got me thinking! Anyone else avoid MFM or even extra OB intervention to avoid induction or being pressured toward induction (or just lots of expensive appointments/scans that aren't needed)?

My previous two pregnancies were both so textbook-like: nausea and super crazy exhaustion starting in 1st trimester, both symptoms pretty much gone near the end of 1st trimester. Not much craziness for symptoms besides that. Both pregnancies previously were boys (now 3 &amp; 5 years old). The only main difference is that with my first pregnancy, my morning sickness wore off each day around dinner time (what a blessing!), but with my second pregnancy, I was pretty much just nauseous 24/7. =.=¨

But this pregnancy?? This pregnancy... I'm sometimes tired, sometimes EXHAUSTED, sometimes nauseous, random times of day it comes and goes, also random pains and cramps at different parts of my abdomen (mostly on the right but occasionally on the left) that also come and go...just...!? And earlier on it was lots of bloating and constipation and gas and sometimes also heartburn and now I also get bursts of mom rage but really I just feel SO all over the place. =

People I've talked to are like ""oh, it's a girl"" = which maybe it is since my boy pregnancies were both so similar and predictable but this one is so all over the place and unpredictable so far. I know you can't really predict that, but I can't help but laugh at how many people have said that to me?! Like, what?? Haha.

Also my sister had fraternal twins during her 3rd pregnancy and I'm 34 and in my 3rd pregnancy so I can't help but wonder if I'm having twins?! I'll find out next week at my first checkup (just 6 more days!) but it's definitely been on my mind.

Not looking for predictions or anything, mostly just wondering there are any other mamas out there who have had similar situations, with crazy symptoms all over the place? Even if you haven't been pregnant before your current pregnancy. Maybe this can just be a safe place for us to rant about symptoms being so random, unpredictable, and all over the place. >à

My first appointment with the OB-GYN is not until April and I am really nervous if my symptoms are normal?

I am looking for some reassurance and tips that has helped you get through your first trimester especially before the first prenatal consultation.

I've tried to be relatively vigilant about the things I'm eating and avoid highly processed food or fast foods, and balance my diet in general so I'm not getting too much of one thing. Of course, sometimes it doesn't always work out, but I like to think I'm doing alright. The issue is, it seems like my desire to eat healthy has verged into overreactive anxiety. It's gotten really bad, where I'm starting to actually count grams of each ingredient and overthink even healthy things, like peanut butter or yogurt or too much fruit. A few years ago I battled anorexia, and it occurred to me today that a lot of the thoughts I've had the past couple weeks seem almost identical to the ones I struggled with back thenthe only difference is that I'm not starving myself. However, if I wasn't pregnant, I probably would. It doesn't help that my mom keeps sending me posts all the time about potential dangers, like chemicals in foods or mattresses or toys, etc. She's trying to be helpful but it just makes me feel worse. I had two brownies yesterday and cried about it because I felt so ashamed. Now I'm avoiding my salad because I think the lettuce tastes weird and I worry there's pesticides on it.

My wife (26) and I (27M) just found out we are pregnant. This hasnt been easy as we have been trying for over three years, so the news was amazing and I have finally stopped crying everytime I see a stroller, which is a lot. We have now known for 3 days and each have only told one person. We are waiting until Mothers Day to tell our families as that would be the end of the first trimester and we dont want to jinx anything considering how long and hard the process has been, but now for the problem. I know I will get some judgement but I have always enjoyed tipping some back and as my family are farmers and very blue collar, theres not a family function that alcohol is not involved, as I have cut back my drinking significantly and often take breaks (Dry January) my family always knows the reason why and always support me. If I just stop drinking without proudly explaining why, they will know something is up and likely deduce the news. Since my wife obviously cant drink Im not drinking as well. Has anyone else dealt with this issue before and have any tips? We really dont want the news to get out early, as much as we both want to shout it from the rooftops, I just dont know how to throw them off the trail as we have multiple birthdays and a college graduation coming up where alcohol will be flowing.

I do not know how far along I am ( I am about to make an appointment at PP for next week) but Im guessing I am around 8-9 weeks. Unfortunately, I have to lie and say that I am having a miscarriage. There is more info below on that. 

A couple of things - I had a MA about a year ago. The process was long and extremely painful for me. I was bleeding heavily for about 24 hours, and kept bleeding for several days with pain. It was an extremely difficult process and I still felt completely drained at my follow up appointment.

I have a few reasons why I am not sure if a SA or MA is better.

1. I will not have an informed support system this time around. I dont want to get into too many details, but I have to lie and say that I had a miscarriage and not an abortion (I know some will think this is wrong. I am sorry but it is my situation. I will be leaving this situation once the abortion is done). This is the main reason why I think a MA might be better, unfortunately.

2. The pain. I understand SA is also painful, but from what I have read, it is much quicker. And I like the idea of having a medical team with me during the whole process. 

3. I am nervous about having to sneak to two separate appointments for an MA. 

I also have a few questions, if anyone is willing to share. 

1. How long do you bleed after the SA procedure? 

2. Can a doctor tell that I have had a surgical abortion if I go to the ER? I believe they cant tell if I have had an MA.

3. When I go to my appointment, will they do the SA on that day? 

Thanks in advance for the help. Its really difficult and scary doing this by myself and keeping it a secret. I just want to be as prepared and informed as possible.

I told him I was pregnant and was keeping the baby, I have a decent paying job and expected to have a good support network around. It was his choice if he wanted to be involved. He said he would support my decision and be there for me. 

Fast forward to now Im currently 16 weeks pregnant, I have a few friends that are supportive (but have their own lives)and baby dad who was doing what he could until the past couple weeks. My family have said Im being selfish (very old fashioned and think Im crazy doing it alone) and havent been supportive at all. I have basically cut them out at this point. 

I was heavily relying on my ex for both emotional support but also just to make me feel less lonely. Its not been an easy pregnancy so far and Im high risk, Ive had to have him come over a few times at the advice of midwives. I know he has his own life to lead and hes said himself he cant be there 24/7 but does want to be involved, then backed off about 2/3 weeks ago. I have reached out but was brushed off, again it was a me problem, but if Im not healthy then baby isnt safe. He has been there when the midwives have advised me to take it easy and knows how high risk I am. I have been signed off work too. How much is too much to expect ?  Im really struggling both physically and mentally with the pregnancy. I also want to build a friendship with him so we can coparent to the best of our ability. I want to be comfortable around him for the birth but also afterwards. I dont think Ill want a practical stranger around me when Im in labour or even in the weeks/months following the birth. 
The fact he is aware that hes the only person I really have right now but is stepping away is also making me think will he do this to the baby.  Can I really trust him to be the best dad. I just want to build a friendship now, maybe initially I thought we could work on us but not now. 

For reference were late 30s early 40s he already has older children (young adults) this is my first but had previous miscarriages. I am financially stable enough to do it alone but just struggling with everything and him having stepped back Im feeling completely isolated. As I said I do have friends I can rely on but they have their own lives (jobs/kids/families etc)

Is it unreasonable to expect baby dad to be involved with me throughout the pregnancy?  Am I expecting too much to build a friendship or even expect him to support me right now?  I dont feel comfortable having him at the appts now or even asking for support when I had a scare. Baby seems to be ok its me thats not doing great. 

We got into a huge fight when I told him that I didnt want him to come along to my next appt and that from now on I was going to do it alone. I would just inform him of updates if there was issues.  That if he couldnt offer the support I needed then we would have to reassess his coming along and also the birth and beyond. I would honestly rather be alone than have him around right now. He just said theres no reason for us to be friends but he does want to know and be there for appts. He isnt getting my view that its my body and if I feel like he will be a stranger then it will be me who decides when he can visit and when he can attend the appts or hospital after birth. 

Maybe I was being too needy, maybe I was expecting too much.  But when I discovered I was pregnant I wasnt expecting to have this emotional turmoil, or to have such a high risk pregnancy. But I also feel he should have been clearer from the start about his boundaries. ","pregnant",2,"https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jargtm/pregnant_to_my_ex/"

"2025-03-13",1741893655,"PL for religious reasons - why are your churchs teachings on reproductive rights the 100% absolute truth?","One of the biggest arguments that I see PL make is that the Bible says abortion is wrong &amp; it goes against Christian values. Faith is not something I particularly relate to, but I do think it can be comforting and deeply personal. In fact, I think its admirable that people can so strongly believe in something that there is not necessarily physical evidence of - I am truly happy for all who find comfort in it.

My question is: why do you feel that your denominations abortion beliefs is correct and above all others?

There are 6 main branches of Christianity &amp; all of them have varying beliefs on abortion. Many protestant denominations are not only pro-choice, but actively advocate for womens reproductive rights. About 60% of Catholics are pro-choice, despite the churchs view on it. 40% of Evangelical Protestants support abortion in cases of rape &amp; 51% are in support for medical reasons. The Mormon, Episcopal, Methodist &amp; Southern Baptist churches support abortion in cases of rape &amp; medical reasons. 

Of course we also need to recognize that many Christian denominations are against it. I am not denying that. But even the churchs messaging is more empathetic &amp; does not include the typical you opened your legs, deal with it sentiment I see from a lot of PL Christians. For example, Pope Francis, who is against abortion, recognizes and advocates for more support for women seeking an abortion, such as grace, community and love. The Baptist Churchs stance preaches the need for access to contraception, community support &amp; financial help. They also acknowledge the complexity of abortion, and even stated this: We acknowledge that we often lack compassion, insight &amp; the necessary commitment to serve our Christian community. We affirm our commitment to &. maintain fellowship with those whose opinions differ from ours and extend the compassion of Christ to all. 

So PL Christians, why are you so adamant that your denominations teachings are correct? Why is whatever your pastor says the 100% absolute truth? Are those who take a more liberal stance not a true Christian and if so, why do you think you or your church has the right to decide what makes someone a real Christian?

How do you justify the contradictions in the Bible? There is not a soul on earth who can never sin, even the Bible says so. Why is abortion one of the worst sins, if all sins are equal? Why do you choose that abortion is wrong, but ignore the part about loving thy neighbor and not judging? Why are you a better Christian than your neighbor who attends a more liberal church down the street?

Thank you in advance - I see a lot of points on the PL side, but this is one that I just really dont comprehend so I appreciate all of the insight! ","Abortiondebate",40,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jak9lk/pl_for_religious_reasons_why_are_your_churchs/"

I had decided I would track my period and we would avoid sex on ovulation or near it. But some how I guess I failed at that. I didnt want get on bc because of how it effects me mentally and I have already have mental health issues. So I thought I could track and that way Id prevent pregnancy and avoid getting on bc until his surgery that is now this month. I was told it was good way to avoid pregnancy if you didnt want to be on birth control. I figured I could handle that. We have literally had sex maybe three times at max in the last three months just trying to be cautious. I have two kids and my last baby I got car sick with. Two days ago I felt car sick and nauseous the next morning and I thought no way. Im still three days away from my period but I never get car sick expect when Im pregnant so that thought was eating me up so just to ease my mind I thought Id take a test. The way I felt sick immediately after getting the positive. Now my son birthday party is tomorrow and I have to make it through that whole time knowing Ive got so this all over again. My head wants to blame my husband because he was supposed to get V surgery over this past year and he put it off and of course when he finally gets it scheduled he had to reschedule. But two abortion back to back feels sick in my head because I know I could have prevented it and just got in bc in the mean time but besides just my mental health I didnt want my huband using me being on bc asa cop out. Not saying he has before but I thought it would make him push off my V more so if he felt I could get pregnant again ( he also doesnt want anymore kids) he would be motivated to get it done. Now I have to do the walk of shame to planned parenthood again I feel so embarrassed. The doctor there really encouraged me to get on bc and now look at me. I could break down crying. This sucks so bad and Im sorry to myself and my body. Im sorry to this baby that I cant keep. I physically couldnt carry a baby anyways anymore because after my last baby, I was told my uterus is so thin they couldnt tell the difference from a uterus in the sack. The baby was in and that I was lucky she had even made it to 36 weeks without my uterus bursting. It was due to devious c-section I have a lot scar tissue and it has sheered out my uterus.

But I have so much fear and anxiety around it. I told my mom and grandma I was pregnant at 3 weeks right after I found out. They were very supportive and my mom and stepdad would adopt the baby. They have two young children (under 4 years old), so my baby would be in their age range. Im also due the week before next school year starts so my pregnancy doesnt affect my schooling. When I first found out, I was so scared and nervous, but loved my baby immediately. At 6 weeks I had an ultrasound and saw the little blob and I felt so much excitement, even though I knew I would never get to raise it. HOWEVER, the issue is, my partner does not want this child. In the beginning he told me I had to get an abortion and at 6 weeks when we made the appointment to go to Planned Parenthood, I couldnt take the first pill. I sobbed and sobbed and begged him to not make me do this and he did not care. We had many fights before that appointment and after that appointment where he told me Im an awful selfish person if I keep the child and how its not okay to gamble on a childs happiness, as it will be adopted by its biological grandmother and still have contact with its birth mother (me). Sorry this is kind of all over the place, but at 4 weeks I told him I was keeping it and so he yelled at me about how much he hated me then left. I freaked out so I told him if he comes back Ill get an abortion. After the appointment where I couldnt take the pills, he left again. And for those two weeks where he was gone I have never been more depressed and lonely. I just missed him so much and wanted a partner in this. My first trimester was really really really rough (nausea, vomiting, MAJOR cramping, flu, sinus infection, ear infections, fatigue). I just began doubting if I could really survive these next 7 1/2 months and that maybe an abortion is whats best. He agreed, as he thinks its selfish to develop the embryo into a child. He said if i get an abortion hell be there for me 24/7 and whenever I need and do whatever I need but Im very unsure. Lately, I constantly cry about loving my baby and he just corrects me saying its an embryo still. But at the same time, if I get an abortion we would be together, wed live together over the summer, wed go on trips&but I know Ill regret it for the rest of my life. My biggest dream has been to have children and I know I wont be able to raise this child, but Im so attached already. I know Ill look at my future children and wonder what if. He says my regret will pass but I adamantly dont think it will& Im unsure what to do. I feel like Im choosing short term suffering over long term suffering. I cant talk to my family about this because they are pro life, so they would not be thrilled with my actions. I just dont know what to do. My gut is telling me to keep my baby but Idk if i can handle the depression and loneliness for these next few months. But I also dont know if i can handle that regret for the rest of my life.

I couldn't come up with any good reason to have a child but now I regret it. I wanted to take care of it. I wanted to apologize. It had eyes and a nose and a mouth and legs and arms and fingers. I feel so terrible. I don't know who to talk to about this. Only my mom and boyfriend knew I was pregnant. My mom doesn't want to talk to me about it at all. She doesn't agree with abortions.

"2025-03-14",1741963333,"Positive MA experience - 10w 0d","Using a throwaway for this one just in case. Although every MA is different, I want to share my story in hopes it will help others in a similar situation.

I discovered I was pregnant on Feb 26th; I'd had what I thought was a light period on January 29th-30th-31st, but it turns out that must have been implantation bleeding. I thought I was only 10 days late for my period based on the timing of that bleed, but it turns out I was much further along. I hadn't had many symptoms except for very sore breasts, some tiredness and loss of appetite, all of which I tend to get before my cycle anyway, so I didn't clue in right away.

I'm in a solid, loving relationship, but we just aren't currently in a situation to add to our family. I have a young child from my previous relationship, and we live in a fairly modest apartment, and for many other reasons it just wouldn't be right to add to the family right now. 

I was a bit panicked when I found out I was pregnant, but my partner was incredibly supportive and understanding. I called my doctor the same day and was referred to our local hospital which has a program for women seeking termination. My partner brought me to the appointment, which was on Wednesday of this week. I'm based in Canada and so it was a very calm and non-judgmental environment; I'm grateful to the doctor and nurse who walked me through my options and explained everything to me.

I was given an ultrasound and blood test the same day and they determined I was at exactly 10 weeks and 0 days, the cutoff for using medical termination in my province. They mentioned I could either schedule a surgical termination for the following week, or do the medical termination as long as I was willing to take the first pill that day. I decided on the medical because I wanted to end the pregnancy as soon as possible - my last pregnancy and birth process were extremely traumatic, and being pregnant again was giving me nightmares and flashbacks, so I couldn't handle the thought of waiting any longer.

Timeline:

6:00 pm Wednesday: took the mifepristone dose as directed. Had some very mild cramping starting about two hours later, which continued the following day.

1:00 pm Thursday: developed a headache, had some additional cramping and mildly upset stomach through the rest of the afternoon.

6:00 pm: took 10 mg ketorolac with a small amount of food.

6:45 pm: took 4 Misoprostol tablets in the cheek for 30 minutes as directed, washed down with water afterwards.

9:00 pm: started having some mild cramping which came in waves, slight chills. Very mild nausea which didn't last. Watched TV with partner and just tried to relax.

10:00 pm: started having some light spotting, cramps continuing. Cramps felt like my worst period day, nothing too major. Chills and started to have diarrhea.

10:45 pm: listened to an audiobook and went to sleep.

11:30 pm: woke up to a strange sensation, felt almost like my hands weren't attached to my body. Felt something shift in my lower abdomen, then a rush of fluid. Fortunately I was wearing heavy duty period undies in addition to a pad already and had no leakage. Went to the bathroom expecting pure blood but discovered it was pink tinted fluid which I assume was water breaking. Pad completely saturated. Pain very minimal.

As soon as I sat down on the toilet I felt something drop out. Had the sensation of needing to push, did so and a much larger clump came rushing out, along with quite a bit of blood. Peeked into the toilet and could see a ring shaped clot, and noticed a light pink thing partially submerged in the blood. It was not pleasant to see and I could tell it was part of a leg/lower torso of the embryo, extremely small but unmistakable.

Had a bit of a cry. Said I was sorry. Remembered what some of the other women have said on here about their babies becoming part of the water. I did not want to be pregnant, but I couldn't help but have feelings about it. I stayed for a while before saying goodbye and flushing.

1:30 am: woke up again, mild cramping and passed some more clots. Took a second ketorolac. Came back to bed and fell asleep easily.

6:00 am: woke up at my normal time, immediately felt different than I'd been feeling for the last few weeks. Breasts still a little sore but pain noticeably reduced from how they had been feeling prior. Did not have the morning upset stomach, and was able to enjoy a coffee (I'd been having aversion to it for about three weeks). Actually had energy as opposed to feeling extremely fatigued. Had moderate amount of blood on the pad and a few tiny clots when going to the bathroom, similar to a day 2 period.

10:30 am (present): cramps have almost completely subsided, have not needed more ketorolac. Ate some breakfast. Still have what is similar to a day 2 period. Energy is much higher than it normally is at this time of the morning.

I will still need to monitor for unusual bleeding, signs of infection, or increasing pain, and will need a follow up to confirm everything has passed, but ultimately the process was not what I expected. I originally worried that 4 Misoprostol wouldn't be sufficient, given that I was 10 weeks along and I've seen stories on here of women needing double the dose. I was worried it wasn't working initially as it took quite some time for the bleeding to start.

For anyone facing this situation right now: just know that you aren't alone. You are doing what is best for your body, and if you aren't ready to give up everything for a baby it means you're doing the right thing for your baby too. Sending healing thoughts and wishes to all of you who are reading this and feeling scared - you can do this if you need to.","abortion",3,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jb5i23/positive_ma_experience_10w_0d/"
"2025-03-13",1741908477,"PH to BKK Experience (Klongtun Hospital)","Hello everyone! I just wanted to share my experience getting an MVA (Manual Vacuum Aspiration) from Klongtun Hospital in Thailand. 


So on February 2024, I found out I was around 4-5 weeks pregnant. At that time I was thinking about ordering pills from WOW and doing the Pill Method instead, but since reading reviews that shipping could take quite a while, my boyfriend and I decided to go to Thailand instead. 


Before the trip and procedure, I talked to Jenny from Klongtun on Line. She gave me the options they had and the price list for all the procedure and the room rates, she also explained what to expect before the procedure (all the lab test and etc). So eventually I booked a slot for March 14 and she gave me an appoinment card. 


Fast forward to March 14, my boyfriend and I took an early morning flight from Manila to Bangkok after everything we checked in our hotel first and had late lunch, eventually we arrived at Klongtun Hospital at around 3:50 PM. 


This was how the process went for me:
- I showed them my appointment card then they quickly asked for my passport and 500thb (cash) for the ultrasound. 

- After the ultrasound, I found out I was already 8 weeks pregnant. 

- I had a consultation and the doctor recommended I do the MVA method, since the whole procedure would only take 5 minutes and I just had to rest for 2-3 hours after. She quoted me 11,000thb for everything (all the tests, MVA procedure, and room fee). She also disclosed that the doctor who will be doing my procedure is male. Afterwards, I paid the 11k using my debit card. 

- After paying, I waited for a bit to do the physical exam (they measured my height, weight, blood pressure, and they cleaned my V and did a pap smear, tbh the pap smear was kind of painful, more painful than the ones I've had in Manila). 

- After the physical exam, they asked my boyfriend to wait in another building then they accompanied me to leave my stuff on the 2nd floor and then accompanied me to the 3rd floor to change to a hospital gown and remove my undies. 

- After changing to a hospital gown, they asked me to lie down first. At this point, there was another girl sleeping in the same room so I assumed I would also be resting there too. 

- After a few minutes they asked me to go to the operating room. It was quite hectic because as soon as I got there they asked me to lie down with my legs up, the nurse to my left stuck a needle on my left hand to sedate me to sleep, while the nurse to my right was measuring my blood pressure, then the nurse in front of me was cleaning my V for the procedure. I saw the male doctor walk in as well, all the nurses were female BTW. At this point, I was feeling very anxious and I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to sleep but yes I did fall asleep immediately after they sedated me. 

- After the procedure, I woke up in a different room with lots of beds but I was the only one there, and at this point the nurse in charge wouldn't let me go up to use the bathroom she just told me to rest and sleep. After a while, she did allow me to use the toilet and she said it was ok for me to use a bidet. At this time she showed me my new ultrasound and the baby was no longer there. She told me the don'ts after the procedure such as: don't drink or eat food that's too hot, don't use a hot compress but warm compress is ok, etc). She also told me that I was asleep for about an hour and a half. She also gave the medicine (ibuprofen, antibiotics, iron pills) and instructions post abortion. After that, I just changed to my clothes and used the sanitary pad they provided. 

- After I was done, I just chatted with some of the nurses they told me it was ok to eat spicy food and raw food. Just not to consume alcohol. 


*Some tips I think that would help:
- go on a weekday as the hospital is not crowded at all. 
- don't be shy to ask the hospital and doctors all your questions before and after the procedure. Based on my experience, they were very patient and answered everything for me. 
- the first few hours were painful for me (felt like really bad dysmenorrhea), but what really helped eased my cramps was doing a warm compress, emphasis on warm. I brought my own hot/cold pack and used it in the hotel. 
- be prepared for the Bangkok traffic, I thought Manila traffic was already crazy but Bangkok is on another level. Although in my opinion, the price of Grab here is better than in Manila. 
- I highly suggest doing this with someone you can trust, as the whole process is very overwhelming and honestly you will need help and assistance esp during the first few hours after the procedure.


I just wanted to share my experience for those who feel anxious about their situation now. For me, the whole experience was very comfortable and I'm glad I got the procedure and healthcare I needed without any prejudice. If you have any questions about the price of the procedure, or if you just have any questions I highly suggest messaging them directly. 

Will try to update again about the post abortion experience. So far it's been about 12 hours since and I don't feel any pain at all.

I am 21, from the United States, and I thought I was doing what was right for me. I still believe that to be the case (I'm active duty military, still in school, and not mentally ready for a baby), but as the days go by I keep thinking about how things might have been. I still have the pregnancy tests from when I found out and I can't bring myself to get rid of them. 

I found out on March 1st, had my MA on the 7th. It all happened so fast that I didn't allow myself to feel any of the emotions until now. From the moment I found out, I had a gut feeling that it would have been a girl. After the initial shock, I accepted the fact that I was pregnant and grew attached to the life I was growing, even though I was only five weeks. I feel like I shouldn't be having these emotions, because it wasn't actually a baby, but I do. I don't have much of a support group (my fiance seems annoyed whenever I try to talk about it, my mother - though supportive - is very emotional and cries if I cry) so I'm mostly dealing with this alone.

"2025-03-13",1741901137,"boyfriend left 3 months after abortion","I'm really just looking for emotional support, I've been going to therapy, talking to friends, but wanted to come into this space to see if others have had similar situations.

Backstory: My boyfriend was 13 years younger than me, I have 2 kids from a previous marriage, this was really the first time I was in love with someone again after my divorce which was a couple years out at this point. We got pregnant after seeing each other for about 3 months. At the time, it felt like an relatively easy answer. Never totally easy, especially as a mom, I know what it's like to go through pregnancy and give birth and love my babies, but I went ahead and opted for a MA right away. It ended up being fairly traumatic though, because it didn't work. I had to go in and get an ultrasound to confirm, and then went on to get a D&amp;C as soon as I could after that. So yeah, totally sucked, definitely left a mark on me more so than I would have expected. 

Fast-forward a few months later: I was on birth control pills now, and end up getting pregnant AGAIN anyways. This time, I'm feeling the effects of the previous experience, my boyfriend and I are much more stable and in love as a couple. I'm not really too spiritual but the chances of all this happening really floored me. I felt so much more protective of this pregnancy, big mama bear energy. Like I wanted to meet this person. I even started looking into open adoptions and contemplated what it would be like to raise a baby on my own, which honestly I felt pretty confident about. My boyfriend was freaked out, and basically gave me an ultimatum saying that if I went and kept the pregnancy he doesn't know if he could stay with me romantically at that point. I felt SO in love with this person that as soon as he said that, that was it, I felt so committed to our relationship and was like, I can't blame him for feeling this way, I get he was young and freaking out, but I choose him and our relationship. Had a harder time getting over this abortion, got depressed, the holidays were really rough for me. I was having a ton of depression and anxiety during this time. Then in January, about 3 months after the abortion, he broke up with me. 

It's been a couple months later, and I'm just SO angry and hurt. I'm such a loyal partner and I'm just so confused. I also hate the fact that this is causing me pain and I think about this all the time and I'm sure he hasn't even realized or given it a second thought. I usually have a lot of compassion for people, like if he needed to leave the relationship, I get it, but the timing still feels so awful, it still feels like I made a huge sacrifice for nothing. I feel like I want some kind of justice, but I know the healthy thing is to forgive him and move on.

"2025-03-14",1741939059,"My experience with surgical abortion","Hello, I wanted to share my experience with a surgical abortion as I know reading other peoples experience helped ease my mind when I was going through it. It's quite detailed, feel free to skip straight to the abortion para, or the end if you just want the key takeaways. (I'm not going to be talking about the morality or debating, if you are pro-life this post isn't for you.)

PRE-ABORTION: I'm 23, I found out I was pregnant at 4 weeks, this was unplanned, I went to a doctor to discuss my options and was told if i wanted to terminate the pregnancy I had to be 5/6 weeks before I could have the pill. To schedule my abortion I called a woman's clinic and was recommended the surgical abortion from them which I was happier with having spoken to 2 people who had the medical one who both said they would recommend I do surgical instead. (I have a low pain tolerance and health anxiety so this made the most sense for me). For the next 2 weeks I had morning sickness and an intense fatigue accompanied with a lack of appetite and just genuinely feeling nauseous and exhausted all the time. 

ABORTION: The day of my abortion I was just over 5 weeks pregnant, when I got to the clinic i was initially in a waiting room, my boyfriend was with me, as I was going under anesthesia and so you have to have someone to drive you home and stay with you for the next 4 hours minimum. I was called in for the first part of it and was given the option to bring him with me up until the actual procedure, which i took. In this part I had an ultrasound where I saw the fetus (I wasn't asked if this is something I wanted to see), then I signed consent forms saying i wouldn't drive, understood the risks etc... 

Then I went into the next room where i spoke to the doctor who was going to be carrying out the abortion. There was a sign on the wall saying ""sometimes hard decisions are the right ones,"" which I liked. She asked me about contraception in the future and when i said condoms she accepted it without question and didn't try to pressure me into hormonal birth control which I've experienced with male doctors in the past. (We didnt use a condom the time I accidentally conceived). She then explained the procedure and that they would essentially be sucking it out of my uterus.  Next i spoke to the anesthesiologist who answered any of my questions regarding that. 

For the procedure I was given a lightweight pink robe instead of a hospital gown, a nurse took me through to the operating room. There was 3 people in total: nurse, doctor and anesthesiologist. I was freaking out at this point and they were compassionate with me and told me when the needle was going in, I began to get groggy and then they put a mask on my face and that was the last thing I remembered.

I woke up in a separate room, made private by a curtain, very groggy and confused, I was laying on a bed with a hot water bottle on my stomach. A nurse came in, asked me how i was feeling and if i wanted painkillers, to which i said yes. The pain wasn't that bad it was like period cramping I more so felt strange. They then offered me coffee/tea/juice and brought in a pack of biscuits and brought my boyfriend in to sit with me as the anesthesia started to wear off. I was there about 30/40 minutes from waking up before we were discharged. For the rest of the day I slept/ watched tv on the couch and took it really slow, as i was very tired. I have only had very minimal bleeding and light cramping since the procedure. The nausea and morning sickness went away instantly. I was given a course of antibiotics for 6 days to prevent infection as that is one of the most common side effects so i have taken one of them every day but for the most part I was fine after with very minimal pain (i used a hot water bottle, didn't need painkillers).

  
Overall I would say it went as well as it could and the procedure itself is nothing to be afraid of as you are in good hands and they do these things every single day multiple times a day, and I have a low pain tolerance and I really had very little (which was one of my main concerns). 

The only other thing to note was price, it was expensive, $700 Aud with Medicare but as i didn't have it i was $1200 out of pocket. ","abortion",4,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jayr3g/my_experience_with_surgical_abortion/"

I had decided I would track my period and we would avoid sex on ovulation or near it. But some how I guess I failed at that. I didnt want get on bc because of how it effects me mentally and I have already have mental health issues. So I thought I could track and that way Id prevent pregnancy and avoid getting on bc until his surgery that is now this month. I was told it was good way to avoid pregnancy if you didnt want to be on birth control. I figured I could handle that. We have literally had sex maybe three times at max in the last three months just trying to be cautious. I have two kids and my last baby I got car sick with. Two days ago I felt car sick and nauseous the next morning and I thought no way. Im still three days away from my period but I never get car sick expect when Im pregnant so that thought was eating me up so just to ease my mind I thought Id take a test. The way I felt sick immediately after getting the positive. Now my son birthday party is tomorrow and I have to make it through that whole time knowing Ive got so this all over again. My head wants to blame my husband because he was supposed to get V surgery over this past year and he put it off and of course when he finally gets it scheduled he had to reschedule. But two abortion back to back feels sick in my head because I know I could have prevented it and just got in bc in the mean time but besides just my mental health I didnt want my huband using me being on bc asa cop out. Not saying he has before but I thought it would make him push off my V more so if he felt I could get pregnant again ( he also doesnt want anymore kids) he would be motivated to get it done.

This sucks so bad and Im sorry to myself and my body. Im sorry to this baby that I cant keep. I physically couldnt carry a baby anyways anymore because after my last baby, I was told my uterus is so thin they couldnt tell the difference from a uterus in the sack.

But I have so much fear and anxiety around it. I told my mom and grandma I was pregnant at 3 weeks right after I found out. They were very supportive and my mom and stepdad would adopt the baby. They have two young children (under 4 years old), so my baby would be in their age range. Im also due the week before next school year starts so my pregnancy doesnt affect my schooling. When I first found out, I was so scared and nervous, but loved my baby immediately. At 6 weeks I had an ultrasound and saw the little blob and I felt so much excitement, even though I knew I would never get to raise it. HOWEVER, the issue is, my partner does not want this child. In the beginning he told me I had to get an abortion and at 6 weeks when we made the appointment to go to Planned Parenthood, I couldnt take the first pill. I sobbed and sobbed and begged him to not make me do this and he did not care. We had many fights before that appointment and after that appointment where he told me Im an awful selfish person if I keep the child and how its not okay to gamble on a childs happiness, as it will be adopted by its biological grandmother and still have contact with its birth mother (me). Sorry this is kind of all over the place, but at 4 weeks I told him I was keeping it and so he yelled at me about how much he hated me then left. I freaked out so I told him if he comes back Ill get an abortion. After the appointment where I couldnt take the pills, he left again. And for those two weeks where he was gone I have never been more depressed and lonely. I just missed him so much and wanted a partner in this. My first trimester was really really really rough (nausea, vomiting, MAJOR cramping, flu, sinus infection, ear infections, fatigue). I just began doubting if I could really survive these next 7 1/2 months and that maybe an abortion is whats best. He agreed, as he thinks its selfish to develop the embryo into a child. He said if i get an abortion hell be there for me 24/7 and whenever I need and do whatever I need but Im very unsure. Lately, I constantly cry about loving my baby and he just corrects me saying its an embryo still. But at the same time, if I get an abortion we would be together, wed live together over the summer, wed go on trips&but I know Ill regret it for the rest of my life.

Im struggling with my decision to have an abortion. Im currently 6 weeks, and the next available appointment isnt until April 2nd (by then Ill be 9 weeks). The guilt is eating me alive, I have had a medical abortion 2 years ago and it was traumatizing! The pain I felt was extreme, and Ive vowed that I would do that again but here I am&

Ive been trying to justify my decision with the fact that Ive been experiencing severe hg and also suffer with HS (which is causing me immense pain due to the hormonal change), and as well as the thoughts that once it is gone Ill be okay again.. but my biggest excuse is that Im terrified to lose my freedom. 

Im 25 and I am in my second year of university while working full time..my spouse has landed a new job also and were excited to have a reliable income together. We are the type of people who are always doing something together, going to the movies randomly, attending concerts, clubbing, and just making spontaneous decisions..so when I found out I was pregnant, I felt like my world was coming to an end. Mind you, I do want children (we both do), but at this point in my life I feel like this is not the time :( I still want to travel the world while were young, because I know when we have children we will lose that freedom. Its killing me because Im terrified to experience that pain again, but also the guilt that we both want children. 

We have been talking about how we feel like were getting old meanwhile everyone around us has families (joking our kids wont have friends because everyone will be older). I feel so angry, and depressed that I cant properly decide on keeping the baby and settling to loose our freedom, or to abort and seek the life we wanted? Every day my decision changes like okay Ill keep it and accept the loss then the next Ill mourn the loss of my freedom and want the abortion. Im angry at my spouse because he doesnt understand the mental turmoil Im going through and is just all whatever you choose, its fine with me so Im left making this huge decision for our lives. The pain is unbearable, Ive been feeling so depressed and everyday I consider taking my own life instead, and to wait longer until April 2nd,  with these thoughts are haunting me, Im scared.

17 days ago I had a suction abortion, I was 6 weeks so early to handle what I had to do. 

Im 31 year old and I have a son who is 10 years old. 

I have a stable and supportive relationship with my boyfriend of almost 2 years and we live together in my houseboat. 

I had the abortion because my boyfriend wasnt ready yet (he is 23) and also the thought of having a baby on board is possible but not at all ideal. 
I did what I knew was best even tho I got warm fuzzy feelings towards the idea of being pregnant and having a love baby together. 

Since Im not on birthcontrol (I tried several times but I have a lot of side effects wich I dont want to have) I asked if he would want a vesectomy (excuse my English as it isnt my language) but he doesnt want that so we agreed on condoms. 

I made him clear that I want him to take the lead and the responsibility in this since he is the one that isnt ready to have kids, pointed out where I put the new package of condoms etc (within reach) 

Today (17 days after the abortion) we had sex for the first time, you probably hear it coming already; as he started cuddling and slides it in unprotected.. even tho I did warn him several times AND told him I dont want to have had this abortion for nothing as we have the risk of getting pregnant directly. 

I did push him out eventually and he is a very supportive and good lovely guy but this action of him gave me a lot of emotions so I wanted to talk about it in this group. 
Afterwards I did confront him as well about if he did think when he just pushed it in and he said he did but couldnt resist.

"2025-03-14",1741941564,"Abortion Is Okay Because Its Their Choice","At the end of the day, abortion is a personal decision, and no one should be forced to stay pregnant against their will. Pregnancy is a major medical event that affects a persons body, health, future, and life in ways that only they can fully understand. No one else has to experience the physical pain, the risks, the emotional toll, or the lifelong consequences of giving birthso why should anyone else get to decide?

Some argue that a fetus has a right to life, but even if we grant that, no one has the right to use another persons body without consent. We dont force people to donate organs, even if it would save a life. If bodily autonomy applies to everyone else, why should it suddenly stop applying to pregnant people?

People get abortions for all kinds of reasonsfinancial instability, medical risks, being too young, not wanting to be a parent, or simply not wanting to be pregnant. And they shouldnt have to justify it. No one is obligated to give up their body for someone else, and pregnancy should be no exception.

If someone believes abortion is wrong, they dont have to get one. But forcing others to stay pregnant against their will is not about valuing lifeits about controlling peoples bodies.","Abortiondebate",221,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jazbb9/abortion_is_okay_because_its_their_choice/"

I told him I was pregnant and was keeping the baby, I have a decent paying job and expected to have a good support network around. It was his choice if he wanted to be involved. He said he would support my decision and be there for me. 

Fast forward to now Im currently 16 weeks pregnant, I have a few friends that are supportive (but have their own lives)and baby dad who was doing what he could until the past couple weeks. My family have said Im being selfish (very old fashioned and think Im crazy doing it alone) and havent been supportive at all. I have basically cut them out at this point. 

I was heavily relying on my ex for both emotional support but also just to make me feel less lonely. Its not been an easy pregnancy so far and Im high risk, Ive had to have him come over a few times at the advice of midwives. I know he has his own life to lead and hes said himself he cant be there 24/7 but does want to be involved, then backed off about 2/3 weeks ago. I have reached out but was brushed off, again it was a me problem, but if Im not healthy then baby isnt safe. He has been there when the midwives have advised me to take it easy and knows how high risk I am. I have been signed off work too. How much is too much to expect ?  Im really struggling both physically and mentally with the pregnancy. I also want to build a friendship with him so we can coparent to the best of our ability. I want to be comfortable around him for the birth but also afterwards. I dont think Ill want a practical stranger around me when Im in labour or even in the weeks/months following the birth. 
The fact he is aware that hes the only person I really have right now but is stepping away is also making me think will he do this to the baby.  Can I really trust him to be the best dad. I just want to build a friendship now, maybe initially I thought we could work on us but not now. 

For reference were late 30s early 40s he already has older children (young adults) this is my first but had previous miscarriages. I am financially stable enough to do it alone but just struggling with everything and him having stepped back Im feeling completely isolated. As I said I do have friends I can rely on but they have their own lives (jobs/kids/families etc)

Is it unreasonable to expect baby dad to be involved with me throughout the pregnancy?  Am I expecting too much to build a friendship or even expect him to support me right now?  I dont feel comfortable having him at the appts now or even asking for support when I had a scare. Baby seems to be ok its me thats not doing great. 

We got into a huge fight when I told him that I didnt want him to come along to my next appt and that from now on I was going to do it alone. I would just inform him of updates if there was issues.  That if he couldnt offer the support I needed then we would have to reassess his coming along and also the birth and beyond. I would honestly rather be alone than have him around right now. He just said theres no reason for us to be friends but he does want to know and be there for appts. He isnt getting my view that its my body and if I feel like he will be a stranger then it will be me who decides when he can visit and when he can attend the appts or hospital after birth. 

Maybe I was being too needy, maybe I was expecting too much.  But when I discovered I was pregnant I wasnt expecting to have this emotional turmoil, or to have such a high risk pregnancy. But I also feel he should have been clearer from the start about his boundaries. ","pregnant",2,"https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jargtm/pregnant_to_my_ex/"

I'm literally crying my eyes out as I type this. I'm 39+6 today, I will be 40 weeks tomorrow. I have tried *everything* I can do get this baby out since 39 weeks. Now before I get lectured about being patient and letting the baby &amp; my body do what it needs to do, I want to say that unless you're in my situation, I don't want to hear that. 

I wanted to be induced at 40 weeks from the beginning as this as been a very difficult pregnancy and I *have* to work up until I give birth and I work as a housekeeper at a hospital, so I have a physically demanding job. I have accomodations and now I only clean one corridor during my shift but at this point, I'm so exhausted. Everything hurts. I have no stamina or energy anymore.

But at my last appointment with my OB, she didn't want to schedule an induction and wanted to discuss it later (this was at 37 weeks) I missed my 38 week appointment due to oversleeping and I missed my 39 week appointment which was yesterday due to the fact that I was having contractions and believed I was going into labor so I spent the time that should've been my appointment, at the hospital being evaluated for the contractions. The contractions stopped. So, it was false labor I guess. 

My next appointment is on the 19th but my doctor will be out of office and I'm meeting with her nurse instead. 

But I can't take this anymore. I just want relief. I'm sick of working while heavily pregnant. I just want to have my baby and start my leave. 

I'm going to try the miles circuit again tonight but if that doesn't work, I feel like my last resort is to go to L&amp;D and beg for them to induce me tomorrow at 40 weeks. I don't care about pitocin, emergency C-Sections, or anything else. I am literally losing my mind, I'm at my wit's end and I can't stop crying, I can't take this anymore 

If I didn't work or have an office job, then yes I'd be more patient, but with the nature of my job, it's just too much for me 

If I go to L&amp;D and request to be induced will they let me??? Please help. ","pregnant",7,"https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jan3ac/can_i_go_to_ld_and_ask_to_be_induced_40_weeks/"

My boyfriend (22) and I (25) always said that if an ""oops"" happened, abortion would be the planbut we also acknowledged that you never truly know how youll feel until you're in that situation. And now, here we are.

I finish my nursing degree in December, have a steady job managing social media (which isnt hard to do and pays well), and were planning to move to Florida next summer. My boyfriend still has at least 3-4 years left of school (he's studying to be a chiropractor or physical therapist), and while he wants to be a dad one day, he admits now is not ideal. That said, he has made it clear that its ultimately my choice, since its my body.

I am pro-choice, but the thought of going through an abortion puts me in such a dark place mentally that I genuinely dont think I could survive it. Its not that I feel ""ready"" to be a mombecause who ever really is?but I just cant see myself going through the process of an abortion. His mom initially said its my decision, but she supports abortion and even called me to basically push for it. My boyfriend, while not pressuring me, also knows keeping the baby isnt what he would have chosen.

I know having a baby right now would make things a lot harder, especially with our move coming up. But I also know I *can* do it. My job is remote, and Ill still be able to work once we move. Plus, Ive always dreamed of being a momliterally forever. I want to be a pediatric or NiCU nurse, and once we move, I plan to find a job in either PEDS or NICU nursing while continuing to work remotely. Having a baby while finishing school wasnt part of the plan, but its not impossible.

Whats weighing on me is knowing that this wouldnt be his choice, and that his mom has already made it clear where she stands. He also told me that if we keep the baby, he probably wouldnt be able to work while studying, and he wants to be able to give the baby everything. I dont want to ruin his future, but I also feel like Id be ruining myself if I went through with an abortion.

Our relationship is so full of love, and the idea of ending this pregnancy when we are happy together *hurts*. It haunts me. I just dont know what to do.

I see a ton of posts about inductions being pushed for suspected large babies but not small, so I wanted to initiate the conversation and see if anyone has experience with this. I have had a totally normal healthy pregnancy so far, 31 years old pregnant with my first baby (a baby boy!) and underwent a routine 36 week US at my office (in retrospect I wish I declined this but you live and you learn) which showed that my baby's estimated fetal weight is 9th percentile, which is technically ""fetal growth restriction"". Of note he measured 24th percentile at prior ultrasound at 28 weeks. I have a repeat growth scan at 38 weeks 3 days and if he is still 9th percentile my OB is recommended induction between 38 to 39 weeks. I have had BPPs and dopplers to check blood flow which have all been totally normal, and I have a gut feeling that this is all seriously overkill. Also of note I was a small baby (6lb4oz at birth) and my husband and I are not big people (115lb pre pregnancy, husband is 150lb), and I have only gained 20-25 lbs during pregnancy. I am praying that he is 10th percentile or above at the growth scan so this is all a moot point, but if he does remain 9th percentile I am really inclined to decline induction if everything else remains stable as to not open the can of worms for cascade of intervention, but of course my first priority is baby's safety and would never want to put him at risk in doing so.

Im at 32 weeks, and friends have been giving gifts and signing them Aunt. For example, they sign their name as Aunt Jane in cards to me, or with a note to baby on the inside of a book. 

No one has asked me how I feel about it, and tbh it feels weird!! I love these people, but many of them live far away, and I would call them FRIENDS, not family. Im so excited for them to meet this baby and vice versa, but I dont think they will be the babys family. 

Obviously family isnt just blood or marriage. But not every friend is family. Some friends are just friends, even if they are very good friends!

I think it bugs me because while I know they are really writing this because they feel close to me, my baby is a separate person. I want this baby to be able to have clear boundaries and expectations with adults. I want them to understand what it means to have familywhat you should be able to expect from family, and what they should be able to expect from you. Friends and family might blur together sometimes, but if someone says theyre your family, kids should be able to form ideas of what that means. And if they decide one of my friends feels like an aunt to them, or we become so interdependent with someone that they become family, then great! But thats not where we are with these folks. 

I know were some time away from these things actually becoming an issue, and that likely it will never be an issue. But some of these folks I see once every 1-3 years. I dont want to show up at their house for a visit one day and have to explain to them then that no, Im not going to tell my child to call them aunt, and they shouldnt ask for that, either. 

My husband assures me this is very far from a big deal, and I know hes right, but it just feels very intrusive. Its like the emotional equivalent of someone touching your belly without asking. I know people already love this baby, and I love that, but they are their own little person, not just an extension of me. 

I know others will likely have their own opinions here. Please feel free to share, but Id also just ask up front that you dont feel the need to say there is a right vs wrong here or try to put down the feeling that Im having.

For a good few weeks I have been feeling bumps on my cervix, that's the best I can describe it, it's not a real twinge of pain but a noticeable little jab feeling really low down in the cervix area. I am very occasionally having what I believe is round ligament pain more towards the front, on either side, and that is indeed painful. I read that baby kicks will feel like bubbles or flutters, might I be feeling something more like pain because the cervix area is more sensitive? I had ultrasounds at 11 and 12 weeks and the techs commented that he was particularly active.

  
All that said, I am having some pelvic girdle pain, initially across my lower back and more recently up inside my thighs, the hip adductor. So maybe that's what's causing the little jabs as it's the same area.

But yesterday I started experiencing...what felt was contractions? The top of my belly and the sides were becoming ROCK hard and it was like a buildup to these and they were painful and I would have to sit down and take deep breaths. I had pelvic pressure like something was going to drop out my a**hole. They were lasting only 1-2 minutes and coming only every 30-60 minutes.

"2025-03-14",1741977997,"Gestational diabetes test results","So Im so frustrated right now because of my glucose testing. 

For some background, I have PCOS, so glucose is something we are concerned about. I went in for 2 hour glucose testing at 15 weeks, and my fasting level was normal as well as my 2 hour level. 

I went in for the routine one hour glucose test at 26 weeks and failed. Which, I was like okay no biggie, lots of people fail their one hour test. 

I went in for my three hour test, and I ended up high for my fasting level. I was a 103, but honestly I think that could be explained by the fact that fasting can make your glucose go up if you have PCOS (they had me fast for 12 hours this time whereas last time I only fasted for 8 hours), AND the girl taking my blood was CLEARLY new. She stabbed my arm like 6 times before moving over to the other arm, again stabbed me like 6 times, and finally had to go get someone else to do it. I REALLY dont do well with blood, and stress can cause your blood sugar to spike. 

My one hour came back and it was exactly 180, which is the cutoff. Then I passed my 2 hour and 3 hour with flying colors! Like, I was a 140 for my two hour (cutoff is 155), and I was a 118 for my three hour (cutoff is 140). 

My doctor calls me today and tells me that I have gestational diabetes. Uhm, WHAT??!!! What do you mean???? I passed my two hour and my three hour test???? And I was right at the cutoff for my one hour test. So they basically just qualified me because my fasting levels are off ? Even though that can be explained by my PCOS and the stress of being stabbed multiple times. And because my one hour test is EXACTLY on the 180 mark? 

I just feel like my doctors dont know what theyre talking about which makes me so nervous. And I was trying to talk to the nurse and she just kept saying your results were abnormal so you qualify and I was like but then why did I even do the two and three hour testing?? If you were going to qualify me from the one hour why didnt you do that the first time I failed my one hour test at 26 weeks?? They told me I had to go in to see how I did at 2 hours and 3 hours and that would determine whether I had it or not. And I passed both of those well within the normal range! 

I just really dont want to prick my finger four times a day if it doesnt seem necessary. I am really really really not good with blood. I of course will do whatever I need to do to protect my baby, but I just wish someone could explain to me how these numbers mean that I have gestational diabetes. I thought you could fail your one hour and still be fine, but apparently being exactly on the cutoff for one hour and being high for a fasting level is enough to qualify you?

Of course, sometimes it doesn't always work out, but I like to think I'm doing alright. The issue is, it seems like my desire to eat healthy has verged into overreactive anxiety. It's gotten really bad, where I'm starting to actually count grams of each ingredient and overthink even healthy things, like peanut butter or yogurt or too much fruit. A few years ago I battled anorexia, and it occurred to me today that a lot of the thoughts I've had the past couple weeks seem almost identical to the ones I struggled with back thenthe only difference is that I'm not starving myself. However, if I wasn't pregnant, I probably would. It doesn't help that my mom keeps sending me posts all the time about potential dangers, like chemicals in foods or mattresses or toys, etc. She's trying to be helpful but it just makes me feel worse.

"2025-03-14",1741974066,"2 progesterone lab results from same day","Hi everyone, I'm not sure I chose the best fitting flair, just wanted to share a personal experience in case anyone ever wondered.

Last week, my NP ordered hcg and progesterone labs for me after I reported some spotting after a bowel movement (I already knew I was pregnant and was just waiting for the 1st OB appt at this time). My labs were drawn around 11am. Before the results came back, the NP said they were able to see me for a quick ultrasound as well, so I returned to the office. Thankfully the spotting was considered normal and they were able to detect fetal heartbeat. It turned into a ""confirmation of pregnancy"" visit so they ordered the pregnancy panel, which included another hcg and progesterone. These labs were drawn at 3pm on the same day.

By Monday, I got all the results back. My progesterone at 11am was 16, it went up to 23 by 3pm. I've read articles about progesterone fluctuating throughout the day and I figured this was a chance to see it in action. What's funny is I requested to be prescribed progesterone after seeing the 16 and maybe it's not necessary, but it still gives me some peace of mind.","pregnant",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jb9qdz/2_progesterone_lab_results_from_same_day/"
"2025-03-14",1741960587,"Kind of traumatizing doctors visit","Is this normal?

I went in for my regular 4 week visit yesterday at 22w4d. This was only my second visit at this office, since I moved mid-pregnancy. The nurse took my blood pressure and it was slightly elevated. I let them know that I do get nervous for visits (on top of that they rush you into the back, have you pee, weigh you, then try to have a full conversation with you and then take your blood pressure). My first visit at the office, 4 weeks ago, my blood pressure was elevated the first time they took it, I think like 150/80. After sitting there for about a minute, they retook it and it dropped to 132/82. I told them my normal blood pressure, before pregnancy was about 120/80. Yesterday, the first time they took it my BP was 153/87 and then they retook it about a minute later and it was 147/83. I know these are elevated blood pressures, but I did not expect what happened next. The midwife comes into the room, we've never met her before and met with a different midwife 4 weeks ago. The first thing she says to us is ""we're sending you to triage"". My husband and I had no idea what she meant, this is our first pregnancy. I honestly thought she was joking because of how cut and dry she said it. She then told me that my BP is so concerning and saying all of these things to me that are instantly terrifying me. We have had a completely healthy pregnancy so far, with zero complications, so this came as such a shock. She was so harsh about the way she was saying things. We had previously expressed that we wanted a natural birth in their birthing center, she starts telling us that this is all at risk and that we need to make sacrifices and ""that's just how parenthood is"". We were completely shocked and scared with the way that she was talking. She didn't even ask us if we have any questions or anything, just told us the directions to OB triage at the hospital. When we got to the hospital they took my blood and had me pee in a cup and explained that they would take my blood pressure every 15 minutes for 2 hours. They wanted to check for early markers of preeclampsia. We met the triage midwife who was much nicer and well spoken. When the 2 hours was up, they prescribed me a low dose of labetalol. All of my blood tests came back negative for preeclampsia. I have no protein in my pee. The only thing going on is an elevated blood pressure. 

I guess I just want to hear from others if this is a normal thing to be sent to triage for or if it seems like an over reaction from the midwife? Also am I completely screwed from having a natural birth? Am I going to get preeclampsia no matter what?? I feel like I left with so many questions and overall just so nervous and scared. What would've been a 30 minute doctors office turned into us at the doctors/ hospital for over 3 hours.

My husband and I decided to TTC last year this month and we got pregnant in July, only for it to end with an ectopic pregnancy rupturing and I lost my right fallopian tube. I was diagnosed with stage 3 endometriosis during this surgery (which I never knew I had) and it had eaten through my entire fallopian tube, causing the ectopic. It was covering my ovaries and all over my insides. After my ectopic, we continued TTC with times sex and using LH strips and BBT monitoring. 

After my ectopic, I started having really short luteal phases (7-8 days) several months in a row. After pushing my OBGYN, they finally decided to run CD21 progesterone labs and discovered that my progesterone was too low to confirm ovulation each month. They tested me three months in a row and confirmed I had stopped ovulating on my own. That combined with my stage 3 endo diagnosis, I was diagnosed with infertility. 

In January, they did an endometriosis excision surgery and found that my other tube was completely clear (yay!). They ran progesterone labs again the following month and I still was not ovulating. They decided to put me on Letrozole 5mg. 

I hit one year TTC this month and my husband and I took a trip to France. I didnt have my hopes high because Im so used to disappointment and seeing negatives, but the night I got home, on 10DPO, I got a positive. 

I immediately took a digital and it came back positive too. I cant believe my first cycle on 5mg Letrozole actually worked!! I am cautiously excited because the protocol following an ectopic is to get bloodwork every 48 hours until I can get a 6 week placement scan to ensure it is not ectopic again. I have started my bloodwork and my 6 week appointment is scheduled. 

I am terrified of losing this baby that we have tried for for so long.

Currently 29 weeks pregnant with my third. For my first two pregnancies I had hg, gd, and chronic hypertension. This pregnancy I have been struggling to maintain a good blood pressure. My morning readings are 145/98 on average and some days I get as high as 162/105. I have been in the hospital 3 times for contractions - my most recent just last week I was admitted into land d for contractions and a bp of 162/90. One bag and two doses of terbutaline and a negative fFn later I was sent home. 

This week my bp has been crazy high. I have had a migraine for three days straight to the point that my vision is clouded by black dots. I also have extreme pelvic pain, pain in my upper abdomen and spine, and literally cannot walk. No contractions but I am hurting so bad its a constant 8 on the pain scale.

In your experience, is it worth it, does it increase stress and costs unnecessarily, and does it push for interventions that aren't needed/scans that end up getting false positives? 

I'm labeled high risk at 39 as a FTM who conceived through IVF (unexplained, but very likely cervical issues). I agreed to MFM care in my first trimester because I was struggling with anxiety and happy for any additional assuring appointments. But at 22 weeks, anxiety is gone and everything is going perfectly with me and baby. I have a baby echocardiogram scheduled for 3 weeks from now, and apparently I'd start to see MFM every 2 weeks (!!) not long after that, in addition to all my OB appointments. 

I spoke with my normal GP today, who specializes in women's reproductive health, and she strongly recommended I consider bowing out of MFM care. This is given my zero indicated risk and the high likelihood that they would induce me (they told me they'd induce me before my due date) and overall push for scans and tests that often give false positives. 

She said MFM really pushes for babies to be born alive and early (pushing induction) vs. thinking about the baby's overall start in life (being able to nurse, breathe well, fight infection, etc). She sees the difference in newborn response and overall health whereas MFM and OB don't treat babies after birth, and the differences she sees between babies born 36-39 weeks vs. 40-41 weeks (especially for healthy women who eat, move, and have supportive communities) is huge. 

It's got me thinking! Anyone else avoid MFM or even extra OB intervention to avoid induction or being pressured toward induction (or just lots of expensive appointments/scans that aren't needed)?

I had been on birth control for 20 ish years and stopped taking my pill around Christmas time. I had my regular withdraw bleed on Jan 2. My husband and I both assumed it would take 3-6 months for my body to regulate and start normal cycles again. Towards the very end of January I started to feel like I was about to start my period but never did. This feeling lasted 2-3 weeks, no period, but I tested very positive on Feb 23.

I called my dr and we went to our first appointment yesterday. He seemed quite discouraged, and said that our baby was only measuring about 5-6 weeks when he felt it should be closer to 8-9. He was not able to detect a heartbeat, but has scheduled us to come back in on the 24th for a repeat ultra sound. 

This is our first baby, so we arent sure what to expect or think. I am convinced that I ovulated at the very end of January/early February, we werent really trying yet so I have to admit I wasnt tracking anything. Im just going by the clear stringing stuff that was coming out of me = sorry if TMI, but it was def the egg white discharge

 My honest feelings are telling me they are going off my last period which wasnt even a period to assume how far along we should be - which I just dont think is accurate. I feel like the 5-6 week mark is correct, in which case our baby is right on track. I have had 0 spotting this entire time btw.

What are the chances of seeing a heartbeat at that stage through a vaginal ultra sound? Should we be worried or does this sound okay? I know the worst thing to do is stress, just wondering if there is anything else I could be doing to find out if everything is going as it should be??

My previous two pregnancies were both so textbook-like: nausea and super crazy exhaustion starting in 1st trimester, both symptoms pretty much gone near the end of 1st trimester. Not much craziness for symptoms besides that. Both pregnancies previously were boys (now 3 &amp; 5 years old). The only main difference is that with my first pregnancy, my morning sickness wore off each day around dinner time (what a blessing!), but with my second pregnancy, I was pretty much just nauseous 24/7. =.=¨

But this pregnancy?? This pregnancy... I'm sometimes tired, sometimes EXHAUSTED, sometimes nauseous, random times of day it comes and goes, also random pains and cramps at different parts of my abdomen (mostly on the right but occasionally on the left) that also come and go...just...!? And earlier on it was lots of bloating and constipation and gas and sometimes also heartburn and now I also get bursts of mom rage but really I just feel SO all over the place. =

People I've talked to are like ""oh, it's a girl"" = which maybe it is since my boy pregnancies were both so similar and predictable but this one is so all over the place and unpredictable so far. I know you can't really predict that, but I can't help but laugh at how many people have said that to me?! Like, what?? Haha.

Also my sister had fraternal twins during her 3rd pregnancy and I'm 34 and in my 3rd pregnancy so I can't help but wonder if I'm having twins?! I'll find out next week at my first checkup (just 6 more days!) but it's definitely been on my mind.

Not looking for predictions or anything, mostly just wondering there are any other mamas out there who have had similar situations, with crazy symptoms all over the place? Even if you haven't been pregnant before your current pregnancy. Maybe this can just be a safe place for us to rant about symptoms being so random, unpredictable, and all over the place. >à

Anyway his brother and mom and dad all love her and she came to stay with his twin brother, and then they all got together at dinner without us and started talking shit about me, doing background checks on me, trying to tell my partner Ive lied about who I was bc they couldnt find my last job and one of my degrees on it and they dont see him as much so I must be controlling and manipulating him, meanwhile Im just trying to fuckin feed myself and nest. WHOLE BIG THING) so partner is going to tell them theyre either cut off or it all stops and they need to cut the ex off. He thought I was crazy at first bc inconceivable right?? but once it all came to light he was so pissed and apologized heavily for not supporting 100% in the beginning. BESIDE THE POINT. Its put my daughter at risk and I have been an absolute mess.

"2025-03-14",1741911316,"Today I had the most inappropriate, violating, dismissive, condescending care ever by an MFM who has never met me before."," WARNING  If you are near Long Island, NY and you ever have a pregnancy in which you need a referral to an MFM for possible high-risk factors, DO NOT EVER go to Cecilia Avila, part of Stony Brook Medicine. Every other doctor in this practice is wonderful. I got the bad egg this time due to bad timing and luck. 

Today I received the most inappropriate and VIOLATING care Ive ever received by a doctor (keep in mind this includes the team and surgeons that *misdiagnosed my appendicitis and left my appendix in by accident*, rendering me infertile and needing IVF in the first place. I wish I had looked up her reviews beforehand. Theyre dreadful. 

Today I was supposed to see an MFM one more time as a formality to make sure I can continue under the Midwives care for the remaining 1-4 weeks of my pregnancy and deliver with them. Thats not what happened. 

Would rate negative stars if I could. She came into the room without ever greeting me or introducing herself. Without ever having met me or reviewing my chart, told me she refuses to allow me back into the SBU midwives care although I have *no high-risk factors* at 36 weeks other than my age (45) and this being an IVF pregnancy. (The baby is in perfect health and is growing on schedule. I am in perfect health, BP is fine, no GD.)

She then told me my plan to go to 40 weeks is basically killing my baby, although Id already been cleared by another MFM in the practice to do exactly that with close monitoring. The statistics for placental issues after 39 weeks for IVF/older patients are in 17/1000 births as opposed to 11/1000 births in other pregnancies. Thats still only 1.7% vs 1.1% - yes, its 42% higher than younger natural pregnancies but LOOK AT THE NUMBERS. 

She went on a rant, speaking poorly of all of these IVF patients lately who dont want induction or to go before 40 weeks and want care other than MFM. Her opinion on IVF patients desire for the least invasive options that can *safely* be done was vile and simply& wrong. Im not a monster for wanting to be under the care of midwives that are still connected to the hospital system, particularly when an OB or MFM on call at the hospital can take over at any time if medically necessary. 

The icing on the cake was when she did a RECTAL SWAB INSERTION for Group B Strep with no forewarning of what she was about to do. I understand this can be part of the process, but a decent doctor would tell the patient what she was about to do first. Had I done this at my midwife appointment, the swab wouldve been self-administered and ONLY vaginal. Not even a hello, and she was shoving a Q-tip up my ass. 

Ive never been treated like this by any medical professional  in 45 years of life. She was dismissive, haughty, condescending, rude, and violating. She does not belong seeing patients. She should be a desk doctor only, reviewing paperwork or in a lab somewhere. Her knowledge of IVF pregnancies is outdated and shes not up on the current peer-reviewed science. She bases opinions on old information and is not interested in hearing new statistics. Checking her reviews, she has told patients to TMFR without doing any actual diagnostic testing!

An MFM sees patients who are high-risk and already frightened and anxious about their pregnancies and their babies health. To treat these patients with anything other than kind, gentle, compassionate care is negligent at best, and dangerous and detrimental to both mental and physical health.

Im not a Karen. I have never reported a doctor in all of the years Ive been alive. Ive seen MANY doctors. This is the first time I have ever been treated like this. I am filing a formal complaint with Patient Advocacy as well as the home office. I plan to contact the Board as well. It seems Im not the first patient who has had this experience - but I want to make sure I am the last. No one should ever be told theyre killing their baby or have an invasive test without warning. 

I honestly have no idea who will be handling my pregnancy here on out, and its so jarring. I was almost at the finish line.

I am 38 1/2 weeks and this past weekend I got extremely sick to the point where I could barely move. The next day I was having some very weird, heavy,  and sometimes painful feeling in my uterus so I decided to go to the hospital to get checked out.

"2025-03-13",1741909051,"Had my baby at 35 + 3.","Went into labor and delivery triage Thursday morning after 12 hours of intense lower pelvic pain and was told I was 2 centimeters and thinning, but after observation they sent me home for not progressing further. Went to work Friday and Saturday like normal, but woke up Sunday morning at 5am to horrid back pain. I went back into triage around 7:15 after not being able to relieve the pain through a hot shower, heat packs, or relaxing.

They get me all checked in, vitals taken, push fluids. and find Im now 4 centimeters and thinning more around 8:15. They move me to an actual delivery suite and tell me to get comfortable. Around 8:30 theyre finally ready to start an IV so I can get my epidural done afterwards per my birth plan, as they wont start one without the IV fluids. The pain has gotten so bad in my back that Im in tears, and my nurse leaves around 9 to track down the anesthesiologist because he hasnt shown up yet, and she tells me to call if I get the urge to poop.

Im texting my husband updates while he tries to hurriedly finish a few last minute things around the house to prepare for her, thinking that we have plenty of time and only live about 5 minutes away. About two minutes later, I get the urge and call, and the midwife does a quick check and tells me Im 10 centimeters and complete and its time to start pushing. Two nurses rush in with the cart while my midwife is still tying on her gown and gloving up, and tells me to start pushing if I need to before shes ready. My husband is rushing to the hospital&but baby girl comes out after 4 minutes of pushing and he runs in the door as theyre placing her on my chest.

Born on the 9th at 5lbs 1.6 ounces. But shes perfect and stays in room with me and husband. No breathing issues, no real health concerns. Im feeling immediate relief and two hours later I feel like I could already slowly walk a marathon around the hospital. Pain is minimal and my nurses are telling me how amazing it is that Im so okay. Were over the moon and bonding, though husband is sad about missing the birth by minutes.

Then I wake up at 2am that first night covered in sweat and shaking so badly I cant safely pick up my baby. Call the nurse, and I have a temp of 102 but no pain or other symptoms of anything. The nurses and midwife are stumped because aside from the fever they track over 2 days, Im perfectly fine. No stomach pain, minimal bleeding, no discomfort. They do rounds of blood work and even send me down for a CT scan the night of the 11th.

And find appendicitis. So I have my baby on the 9th and my appendix removed on the 12th. And after the recovery, our planned 2 day hospital stay turned into 5. But were home now and adjusting, and in a way it all feels like some weird fever dream, going from 4 to 10 centimeters in about an hour. Im in more pain from the surgery than the delivery, but baby is healthy and thriving and thats all that really matters.

I want to preface this by saying I did have dental issue prior to my first pregnancy but it was manageable at the time. This is a direct result of my pregnancy. Anyways I had my second baby last year (2 under 2) and one of the most disheartening things has been my teeth. I have to get dental implants because my pregnancy cost me my bottom molars on both side. During my pregnancy I had HG which made me severely anemic, malnourished, and stressed. I would grind my teeth at night, threw up at any time especially early morning, and I couldnt stomach tooth paste. I couldnt take my prenatal either because even after trying 7 different brands I would vomit to the point of bleeding after taking them. Which means my babies took the calcium they needed from me. On top of everything I was so depressed that I barely cared once I noticed my teeth literally cracking (was speaking out pieces of teeth). With this combination my teeth were destroyed with the latest being pulled last month. I hate to smile now because my teeth have cracks, chips, and holes in most of my teeth. I lost my job during my first pregnancy so I have basic dental care through medicaid which doesnt cover the work I need. I love my babies dearly but I didnt know it would cost me my smile in so many ways. Emotionally and mentally I barely want to smile and now its a physical reason that my smile feels horrible. Please take your prenatals, please push your doctors to check your levels to insure youre not deficient anywhere, and do remember that pregnancy is harsh. Never have a baby for any reason other than YOU wanting that baby because it can cost you in ways you never wouldve thought. I had my babies for me of course but the cost hit really fast.

So um. Nobody prepared me for the pain that comes with contractions. The pain will be different for everyone of course, but in my experience contractions started off like bad abdominal period cramps for a day, very tolerable. The following day.. they progressed to my back and it felt like someome was using all their force and swinging a baseball bat into my tailbone/lower back =5=« HOLY F!! No one prepares you for that. I just remember thinking God PLEASE help me!  and all you can do is shut your eyes as tight as they allow and groan through it. 

I finally went to the hospital that second night and next came the cervical check. The cervical check to me, felt like a sharp hot knife entering your vagina.. WTFFF. I instantly started sobbing and asked the nurse to please stop, and that i dont want to have a cervical check done. She told me she barely even went in but i was sobbing uncontrollably, i couldnt catch my breath, the pain was like nothing ive ever felt before. They had to convince me to get a cervical check with the help of fentanyl. Once I got the fentanyl, I was able to tolerate a cervical check. I was 6cm dilated. Thank you God for modern medicine! 

The pain absolutely wiped me out, I just wanted to sleep in between each contraction, my eyes would shut from all the pain and my body wanted me to fall asleep because it took every ounce of energy out of me. But then another contraction would beat you up awake again =5=«=-


My pain tolerance must be so low! I got the epidural shortly after being admitted... epidural = pure bliss.

I'm not high risk,  nor have I had any complications other than terrible pregnancy sickness.  

The anxiety is just horrible, I have stomach issues, even before pregnancy and I was warned the scar tissue could turn cancerous if I don't take care of myself so I already have a chance of dying it feels like.  (I've been puking stomach acid this while pregnancy, I know it's getting worse I can feel the pain from time to time) 

No matter what my bf thinks, I'm going to tell the Dr to deliver my baby that if any complications arise, save me before, baby.  We can have another kid. My mom can't have another me.  I never wanted to be a mom, so I had no intention of dying for a child I didn't want.

I'm worried my bf will hate me for saying that, but I've said since we met, I didn't want kids.  This pregnancy was not planned, and he's the ""God gave us this kid for a reason"" type of guy.  So, he probably would've left me had I went through with  the termination.  Of all the women out there PRAYING for a baby, why did it have to be ME that gets one??


Edit
He is not using me for a baby.  That's not what happened.  The condom broke, and I got pregnant.  I told him from the beginning that if I'd accidentally fall  pregnant, I wasn't sure if I'd keep it.  But, he proved to me that he isn't like my father was to me. He'll be a great dad.  We were together for a while before it happened, I know him like the back of my hand.  And he knows me like the back of his hand.  We never argued or fought once. We had disagreements, but it was settled quickly without any problems.  I wanted it to be us for a while longer before we had kids if we got to that point.

Any who, I found out I was pregnant Feb 2nd and we had never spoke of babies up until I found out I was preggo. She got completely fixated on that and did everything she could to suddenly get pregnant shortly after. She would send messages almost nightly about how she just got 'creampied' and give like all these details of how she was keeping the semen inside to get preggo. And then suddenly she said she and her boyfriend had been trying for a while to get pregnant and it never worked..... Well she sent a positive test probably around 2 weeks ago and she found out when she was like 8 days pregnant and had booked an ultrasound the day of at PP. Freaked out because they couldn't see the baby (because she literally just got pregnant but for some reason lied and told them she was 4 weeks pregnant) and has just been fucking non stop ever sense. I caught her lying about her saying her boyfriend was 'actively' trying to get her pregnant for a while, because now that she is he's not excited because hes 23 and he said he wasn't planning to have a baby and basically just said she started getting crazy about it out of nowhere....... I shit you not she has been daily been sending messages EVEN AT 9 DAYS PREGNANT about having food aversions, nausea, all this stuff but then when she was worried that they didn't see anything at 8 days pregnant she admitted she hasn't had any symptoms so she was concerned that they were saying they didn't see any signs of a fetus. It's just been so weird. Every day she's been non stop and normally I would be excited to have someone to relate to but I feel like she is pushing it all so hard. I struggled so bad between weeks 6-9 and she just doesn't understand idk. I'm sure she's starting to have symptoms at 4 weeks, but every single day its something but then shes out doing a whoooooole bunch of stuff which I feel like contradicts what she says and I just find it hard to believe how authentic shes being about it all because shes just been weirding me out entirely honestly. every day she just talks about herself nonstop and will go on and on and on &amp; not pick up social cues of when to stop and sometimes its like overly detailed and TMI??? She once sent a photo of toilet paper after she wiped to show her discharge ?

We were all talking in the chat today and she of course is already just going on and on and on about how shes already created her baby registry and shes going to start sending it out and she sent it in the chat to my friend &amp; I, and she was just saying how excited she is etc and I responded saying I'm just nervous because its a complete life change and something I've obviously never done before (she hasn't either) and that i hope i will be a good mom etc and she responded this entire paragraph saying this"" sometimes being a mother isn't meant for everyone, you really have to consider if this is the right choice for you, it is going to be a life altering decision, and a addition to your life that once its here it is truly your responsibility. you are a very young girl and you already have a lot of animals, if you genuinely don't think being a mother is something your going to want to do for the next 16 years until they get their license, its okay to wait a bit longer. i don't want to stress you out but there are going to be sacrifices. this is legit the rest of your life that's going to be changed. god forbid they do a sport that you hate."" and i was honestly appalled by this message. She made me feel like i was SO out of line for saying I'm genuinely nervous to be a mother and i get anxious thinking about it sometimes. Like who are you to tell me that at all? Idk.

My OB wanted to induce because while I do not have GD or diabetes, I do have a strong family history of diabetes and gained 6 pounds in between the 3 weeks of my last appointments. OB wanted to be safe rather than sorry and scheduled me for 39 weeks, which I agreed with.

This was my second pregnancy. My first came at 38 weeks, water breaking but no contractions so I was given pitocin and other meds to help me along. My epidural never really worked the way it was supposed to and by the time my 26 hour labor (1 hour pushing) was over I could transfer myself to my own gurney. I also felt a lot of pain while pushing. 

For this baby my OB said she'd give me the epidural whenever i was ready. I opted when I was around 3-4cms. They didn't give me pitocin until the epidural was working, which was such a game changer. She did break my water before but the cervix check hurt more than that. We got the epidural placed and all was well. I started feeling my right leg though, as well as contractions on that side of my stomach, and had to tell a nurse three times before she got the anesthesiologist to come back and look at it. 

Once it was pulled back and adjusted my pain was gone. They said I could probably push if I was ready and 5 minutes later, my baby was born.

I asked for an elective induction on my due date for my second pregnancy. I actually drove myself to the hospital and begged to be induced ha.

I was just done being pregnant, I had a rough and painful (had to start leave from work a month earlier than expected because my hip pain was so bad I could barely walk) third trimester. Pregnancy was otherwise really healthy/ uncomplicated. Ive had one previous vaginal delivery (spontaneous labor at 39 weeks after membrane sweep). Relatively uncomplicated hospital birth (20hrs in labor, 30min pushing, second degree tear, normal recovery. I did have terrible back labor though but once I got the epidural I felt nothing).

My husband met me at the hospital and we had lunch and then walked over to L&amp;D. We got checked in and found out I was already 5cm dilated. Got started in pitocin and started having contractions. I BARELY felt the contractions though they felt like mild period cramps but could see them in the monitor. My husband and I happily hung out and watched tv for three hours (we joked it was the first date wed been on in months ha). 

After a few hours the contractions started to hurt a but more so I asked for an epidural. By the time i got the epidural they were pretty painful but i was able to breathe through it all. Epidural worked and dulled the pain a bit (not as strong as the one id had with my first delivery). Nurse checked my cervix (7cm now) and accidentally broke my water. 

I IMMEDIATELY felt the need to push/ excruciating pressure. She checked me again, lo and behold I was at 10cm. 

I pushed like 4 times and my healthy baby girl was born 8 minutes later. The midwife barely had time to get to the room. I didnt tear at all! They removed the epidural and I basically felt totally normal& 

Shockingly easy recovery, was out to lunch with friends a few days later& 

It felt like the epidural didnt work below my belly but honestly the pushing part was so fast it was fine. I also wonder if I didnt tear because I could feel everything& Anyways, I hope any future birth I may have goes exactly like this again.

From the time I was 17 I was told I'd never be able to have kids because of severe endometriosis and pcos and was absolutely devastated because I always knew I wanted babies seeing as I had helped raise babies since I was 12.

Unfortunately for my husband and I we lost our angel at 8 weeks and I felt like my whole world was crashing around us. It felt like there was our only chance after 7 years together struggling and hoping.  Then last year happened. Exactly a year after we lost our baby we found out we were pregnant again.  To say I was terrified would be an understatement always wondering if something would go wrong. Always looking to each appointment to make sure baby boy was ok. Every appointment we waited for the other shoe to drop. We just tried to enjoy the time we had while hoping everything would stay healthy.

They've been getting better in my 2nd trimester, however, I have a coworker who irritates theeee shiiiiit out of me. She's actually SO NICE, but she reeks of ""desperation""... I can't think of a different or better word... of wanting to ""fit in"" &amp; be a part of every conversation... its irritating.. we are at work, I'm inquiring about something work related &amp; she manages to squeeze in a comment regarding something outside of work.. just to say it... or just to have an interaction.. and the bosses have new rules now &amp; she sarcastically brings them up, OFTEN. Like okay, jokes old already &amp; I don't want to fake laugh, just bc i feel bad.. also, she was calling my baby ""peanie"" the entire first trimester.. just a horrid nickname..not cute..and in the sonogram, baby didn't even LOOK like a peanut.. if it did, call it peanut.. not peanie... bc wth is that? I asked her to stop. My aunt also called it peanut.. I literally asked, ""where does it look like a peanut?"" ... its annoying as shit.

Anyway, back to coworker (who I've known since hs.. we are in our mid 30s now)

Examples:
1. How's peanie? Idk...... good, I hope!
2. Go eat, you're eating for two now.... no, I'm not.. and I don't eat unless I feel hungry or it's been a while since I've eaten. Even so, just bc I feel a slight twinge of hunger, doesn't mean I have to go stuff my face.
3. When im walking away from my work station, ""don't forget to clock out &amp; not waste company time.. or you'll get fired"" (jokes old already! .) - ""don't forget to clock out before you use the bathroom"" - all sarcastic joking comments, and only she's laughing.. legit laughing.. and im like.. this isn't even funny to me.. enough already.. 
4. Talking about work related shit &amp; she wants to throw in, ""we need a girl day"" . . . Or some personal stressful detail about her life, COMPLETELY irrelevant from the work related shit im talking about.. not even a conversation starter, just legit one sentence. One comment. Just to say it.
5. Talking about food and how hungry she is ALL THE TIME and then comments about how good the food was or how bad it messed up her belly.. comments on it FOR HOURS throughout the workday.. I've turned into a ""that's crazy"" person.... &amp; a ""don't make eye contact"" person, otherwise, she's blurting out ""those empanadas were so good.. I want more"" ..... SO GET THEM! It's like why do you have to say something every single time i face your direction? Like idc!
6. I had a browning banana on my desk and she tells me, ""you better eat that before it goes bad.."" - I said i will if I want it, but if it goes bad, I'll toss it. I'm not afraid to throw food away if i need to.. I'm not a food hoarder and I don't eat every single moment I'm hungry or just bc food is in front of me. 
7. She thinks just bc I'm pregnant I'm supposed to be eating like a cow... I was telling her something about me and my bf eating and she inquires about my bf, ""he eats as much as you?""  - B%#$* !! first of all, I'm not heavy. I love my body, I think I'm pretty =% hot, &amp; I feel good about myself in a world where what we see online can make us feel like pure shit. Even if i was heavy, juicy,.... a voluptuous woman.. id still feel sexy. however, I do not look like I overeat.. at all. So that comment implies that just bc I'm expecting, I eat more than my 5""11 190lb weight lifting BF !? I can barely eat with all of my food aversions. I'm 5'3, always bloated in belly (prior to pregnancy) due to PCOS.. but to say that shit...  my blood boiled. The assumptions are crazy annoying. Just bc im pregnant, you're simply going to assume i cant control my food intake. Wth. 
8. She suffers from anxiety, I'm someone who worries here and there, has fears, like anyone else... especially as a FTM and possible complications etc. I was so nervous in the beginning of this pregnancy... and so she would make comments like, ""people like us"" or ""you know how our mind works"" ... associating me with an anxiety disorder. It's like she took my valid ass fears or worries.. and moments* of anxiety... to compare to HER &amp; associates with anxiety
9. Tells my worker (who trusts my pallet) that as long as she sits next to me, she's going to gain weight. (Again, not bc I'm heavy.. she just think bc I'm pregnant, I eat like a savage) mind you I have 2 meals a day bc so many food thoughts turn me off.) You're not about to blame me for my food recommendations*** &amp; if someone chooses to eat it.. and gains weight, ""blame her"" .. you're not cute or funny. Bc what you're saying isn't even true! If it were true, it wouldn't bother me.

I went to the ER (mind you this was my third doctor visit in a week to find out whats wrong.) They spotted a SCH that had some blood and debri, they assured me that was where the extra nasty discharge was probably coming from. They told me that should pass on its own. They then noticed how short my cervix was. It was at a 2.3-2.5. They kept me overnight with the TOCO machine to spot any early contractions and had me on progesterone all night to see if it helped. The high risk doctor measured my cervix the next morning and it was a 3.1. He was more confident that things were better but still wanted to follow up in a few days to check on things. They prescribed me progesterone and Ive been on it for 5 days now. I went back to the doctor today for a follow up. My cervix is measuring at 1. They are assuming the progesterone wasnt doing so well and are highly suggesting a cerclage. Ive took it very easy the past few days and missed a bunch of work and been on bed rest (my decision.) Im not sure what caused the cervix to get that bad so quickly. Im going to be admitted again tonight. They are going to put me back on the toco machine to check for contractions and put me on more medication tonight to prepare for surgery tomorrow. God willing. The doctor told me she has seen a lot of success with cerclages but she has also been there for cases that still had a bad outcome where they went into pre term labor and couldnt stop it regardless of the cerclage.

Im currently 9 weeks and 4 days pregnant with my first baby. After my first prenatal appointment, I received unexpected news from my employer that we need to return to the office after nearly three years of working remotely. I was devastated because I had hoped to work from home during my pregnancy and through my babys first year, but here we are.

I spoke with my doctor about it, and she gave me some great advice to make the transition easier, like treating myself to lunch nearby, listening to my favorite podcast on the commute, and finding small ways to make the experience more pleasant. That helped me mentally prepare, but Im still struggling with first-trimester fatigue, sleepiness, food aversions, and all the fun symptoms that come with early pregnancy. I have been told things get better in the second trimester, so Im hopeful.

Now, I have the option to work either:

* 5 days a week, 8 hours a day
* 4 days a week, 10 hours a day with 3-day weekends

I would love to hear from others who have worked a flex schedule while pregnant. For context, I'm a software developer. My commute would be 45 - 60 minutes.

"2025-03-14",1741963333,"Positive MA experience - 10w 0d","Using a throwaway for this one just in case. Although every MA is different, I want to share my story in hopes it will help others in a similar situation.

I discovered I was pregnant on Feb 26th; I'd had what I thought was a light period on January 29th-30th-31st, but it turns out that must have been implantation bleeding. I thought I was only 10 days late for my period based on the timing of that bleed, but it turns out I was much further along. I hadn't had many symptoms except for very sore breasts, some tiredness and loss of appetite, all of which I tend to get before my cycle anyway, so I didn't clue in right away.

I'm in a solid, loving relationship, but we just aren't currently in a situation to add to our family. I have a young child from my previous relationship, and we live in a fairly modest apartment, and for many other reasons it just wouldn't be right to add to the family right now. 

I was a bit panicked when I found out I was pregnant, but my partner was incredibly supportive and understanding. I called my doctor the same day and was referred to our local hospital which has a program for women seeking termination. My partner brought me to the appointment, which was on Wednesday of this week. I'm based in Canada and so it was a very calm and non-judgmental environment; I'm grateful to the doctor and nurse who walked me through my options and explained everything to me.

I was given an ultrasound and blood test the same day and they determined I was at exactly 10 weeks and 0 days, the cutoff for using medical termination in my province. They mentioned I could either schedule a surgical termination for the following week, or do the medical termination as long as I was willing to take the first pill that day. I decided on the medical because I wanted to end the pregnancy as soon as possible - my last pregnancy and birth process were extremely traumatic, and being pregnant again was giving me nightmares and flashbacks, so I couldn't handle the thought of waiting any longer.

Timeline:

6:00 pm Wednesday: took the mifepristone dose as directed. Had some very mild cramping starting about two hours later, which continued the following day.

1:00 pm Thursday: developed a headache, had some additional cramping and mildly upset stomach through the rest of the afternoon.

6:00 pm: took 10 mg ketorolac with a small amount of food.

6:45 pm: took 4 Misoprostol tablets in the cheek for 30 minutes as directed, washed down with water afterwards.

9:00 pm: started having some mild cramping which came in waves, slight chills. Very mild nausea which didn't last. Watched TV with partner and just tried to relax.

10:00 pm: started having some light spotting, cramps continuing. Cramps felt like my worst period day, nothing too major. Chills and started to have diarrhea.

10:45 pm: listened to an audiobook and went to sleep.

11:30 pm: woke up to a strange sensation, felt almost like my hands weren't attached to my body. Felt something shift in my lower abdomen, then a rush of fluid. Fortunately I was wearing heavy duty period undies in addition to a pad already and had no leakage. Went to the bathroom expecting pure blood but discovered it was pink tinted fluid which I assume was water breaking. Pad completely saturated. Pain very minimal.

As soon as I sat down on the toilet I felt something drop out. Had the sensation of needing to push, did so and a much larger clump came rushing out, along with quite a bit of blood. Peeked into the toilet and could see a ring shaped clot, and noticed a light pink thing partially submerged in the blood. It was not pleasant to see and I could tell it was part of a leg/lower torso of the embryo, extremely small but unmistakable.

Had a bit of a cry. Said I was sorry. Remembered what some of the other women have said on here about their babies becoming part of the water. I did not want to be pregnant, but I couldn't help but have feelings about it. I stayed for a while before saying goodbye and flushing.

1:30 am: woke up again, mild cramping and passed some more clots. Took a second ketorolac. Came back to bed and fell asleep easily.

6:00 am: woke up at my normal time, immediately felt different than I'd been feeling for the last few weeks. Breasts still a little sore but pain noticeably reduced from how they had been feeling prior. Did not have the morning upset stomach, and was able to enjoy a coffee (I'd been having aversion to it for about three weeks). Actually had energy as opposed to feeling extremely fatigued. Had moderate amount of blood on the pad and a few tiny clots when going to the bathroom, similar to a day 2 period.

10:30 am (present): cramps have almost completely subsided, have not needed more ketorolac. Ate some breakfast. Still have what is similar to a day 2 period. Energy is much higher than it normally is at this time of the morning.

I will still need to monitor for unusual bleeding, signs of infection, or increasing pain, and will need a follow up to confirm everything has passed, but ultimately the process was not what I expected. I originally worried that 4 Misoprostol wouldn't be sufficient, given that I was 10 weeks along and I've seen stories on here of women needing double the dose. I was worried it wasn't working initially as it took quite some time for the bleeding to start.

For anyone facing this situation right now: just know that you aren't alone. You are doing what is best for your body, and if you aren't ready to give up everything for a baby it means you're doing the right thing for your baby too. Sending healing thoughts and wishes to all of you who are reading this and feeling scared - you can do this if you need to.","abortion",3,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jb5i23/positive_ma_experience_10w_0d/"

I am 21, from the United States, and I thought I was doing what was right for me. I still believe that to be the case (I'm active duty military, still in school, and not mentally ready for a baby), but as the days go by I keep thinking about how things might have been. I still have the pregnancy tests from when I found out and I can't bring myself to get rid of them. 

I found out on March 1st, had my MA on the 7th. It all happened so fast that I didn't allow myself to feel any of the emotions until now. From the moment I found out, I had a gut feeling that it would have been a girl. After the initial shock, I accepted the fact that I was pregnant and grew attached to the life I was growing, even though I was only five weeks. I feel like I shouldn't be having these emotions, because it wasn't actually a baby, but I do. I don't have much of a support group (my fiance seems annoyed whenever I try to talk about it, my mother - though supportive - is very emotional and cries if I cry) so I'm mostly dealing with this alone.

"2025-03-13",1741901137,"boyfriend left 3 months after abortion","I'm really just looking for emotional support, I've been going to therapy, talking to friends, but wanted to come into this space to see if others have had similar situations.

Backstory: My boyfriend was 13 years younger than me, I have 2 kids from a previous marriage, this was really the first time I was in love with someone again after my divorce which was a couple years out at this point. We got pregnant after seeing each other for about 3 months. At the time, it felt like an relatively easy answer. Never totally easy, especially as a mom, I know what it's like to go through pregnancy and give birth and love my babies, but I went ahead and opted for a MA right away. It ended up being fairly traumatic though, because it didn't work. I had to go in and get an ultrasound to confirm, and then went on to get a D&amp;C as soon as I could after that. So yeah, totally sucked, definitely left a mark on me more so than I would have expected. 

Fast-forward a few months later: I was on birth control pills now, and end up getting pregnant AGAIN anyways. This time, I'm feeling the effects of the previous experience, my boyfriend and I are much more stable and in love as a couple. I'm not really too spiritual but the chances of all this happening really floored me. I felt so much more protective of this pregnancy, big mama bear energy. Like I wanted to meet this person. I even started looking into open adoptions and contemplated what it would be like to raise a baby on my own, which honestly I felt pretty confident about. My boyfriend was freaked out, and basically gave me an ultimatum saying that if I went and kept the pregnancy he doesn't know if he could stay with me romantically at that point. I felt SO in love with this person that as soon as he said that, that was it, I felt so committed to our relationship and was like, I can't blame him for feeling this way, I get he was young and freaking out, but I choose him and our relationship. Had a harder time getting over this abortion, got depressed, the holidays were really rough for me. I was having a ton of depression and anxiety during this time. Then in January, about 3 months after the abortion, he broke up with me. 

It's been a couple months later, and I'm just SO angry and hurt. I'm such a loyal partner and I'm just so confused. I also hate the fact that this is causing me pain and I think about this all the time and I'm sure he hasn't even realized or given it a second thought. I usually have a lot of compassion for people, like if he needed to leave the relationship, I get it, but the timing still feels so awful, it still feels like I made a huge sacrifice for nothing. I feel like I want some kind of justice, but I know the healthy thing is to forgive him and move on.

"2025-03-14",1741939059,"My experience with surgical abortion","Hello, I wanted to share my experience with a surgical abortion as I know reading other peoples experience helped ease my mind when I was going through it. It's quite detailed, feel free to skip straight to the abortion para, or the end if you just want the key takeaways. (I'm not going to be talking about the morality or debating, if you are pro-life this post isn't for you.)

PRE-ABORTION: I'm 23, I found out I was pregnant at 4 weeks, this was unplanned, I went to a doctor to discuss my options and was told if i wanted to terminate the pregnancy I had to be 5/6 weeks before I could have the pill. To schedule my abortion I called a woman's clinic and was recommended the surgical abortion from them which I was happier with having spoken to 2 people who had the medical one who both said they would recommend I do surgical instead. (I have a low pain tolerance and health anxiety so this made the most sense for me). For the next 2 weeks I had morning sickness and an intense fatigue accompanied with a lack of appetite and just genuinely feeling nauseous and exhausted all the time. 

ABORTION: The day of my abortion I was just over 5 weeks pregnant, when I got to the clinic i was initially in a waiting room, my boyfriend was with me, as I was going under anesthesia and so you have to have someone to drive you home and stay with you for the next 4 hours minimum. I was called in for the first part of it and was given the option to bring him with me up until the actual procedure, which i took. In this part I had an ultrasound where I saw the fetus (I wasn't asked if this is something I wanted to see), then I signed consent forms saying i wouldn't drive, understood the risks etc... 

Then I went into the next room where i spoke to the doctor who was going to be carrying out the abortion. There was a sign on the wall saying ""sometimes hard decisions are the right ones,"" which I liked. She asked me about contraception in the future and when i said condoms she accepted it without question and didn't try to pressure me into hormonal birth control which I've experienced with male doctors in the past. (We didnt use a condom the time I accidentally conceived). She then explained the procedure and that they would essentially be sucking it out of my uterus.  Next i spoke to the anesthesiologist who answered any of my questions regarding that. 

For the procedure I was given a lightweight pink robe instead of a hospital gown, a nurse took me through to the operating room. There was 3 people in total: nurse, doctor and anesthesiologist. I was freaking out at this point and they were compassionate with me and told me when the needle was going in, I began to get groggy and then they put a mask on my face and that was the last thing I remembered.

I woke up in a separate room, made private by a curtain, very groggy and confused, I was laying on a bed with a hot water bottle on my stomach. A nurse came in, asked me how i was feeling and if i wanted painkillers, to which i said yes. The pain wasn't that bad it was like period cramping I more so felt strange. They then offered me coffee/tea/juice and brought in a pack of biscuits and brought my boyfriend in to sit with me as the anesthesia started to wear off. I was there about 30/40 minutes from waking up before we were discharged. For the rest of the day I slept/ watched tv on the couch and took it really slow, as i was very tired. I have only had very minimal bleeding and light cramping since the procedure. The nausea and morning sickness went away instantly. I was given a course of antibiotics for 6 days to prevent infection as that is one of the most common side effects so i have taken one of them every day but for the most part I was fine after with very minimal pain (i used a hot water bottle, didn't need painkillers).

  
Overall I would say it went as well as it could and the procedure itself is nothing to be afraid of as you are in good hands and they do these things every single day multiple times a day, and I have a low pain tolerance and I really had very little (which was one of my main concerns). 

The only other thing to note was price, it was expensive, $700 Aud with Medicare but as i didn't have it i was $1200 out of pocket. ","abortion",4,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jayr3g/my_experience_with_surgical_abortion/"

I had decided I would track my period and we would avoid sex on ovulation or near it. But some how I guess I failed at that. I didnt want get on bc because of how it effects me mentally and I have already have mental health issues. So I thought I could track and that way Id prevent pregnancy and avoid getting on bc until his surgery that is now this month. I was told it was good way to avoid pregnancy if you didnt want to be on birth control. I figured I could handle that.

Not saying he has before but I thought it would make him push off my V more so if he felt I could get pregnant again ( he also doesnt want anymore kids) he would be motivated to get it done. Now I have to do the walk of shame to planned parenthood again I feel so embarrassed. The doctor there really encouraged me to get on bc and now look at me. I could break down crying. This sucks so bad and Im sorry to myself and my body. Im sorry to this baby that I cant keep. I physically couldnt carry a baby anyways anymore because after my last baby, I was told my uterus is so thin they couldnt tell the difference from a uterus in the sack. The baby was in and that I was lucky she had even made it to 36 weeks without my uterus bursting. It was due to devious c-section I have a lot scar tissue and it has sheered out my uterus.

But I have so much fear and anxiety around it. I told my mom and grandma I was pregnant at 3 weeks right after I found out. They were very supportive and my mom and stepdad would adopt the baby. They have two young children (under 4 years old), so my baby would be in their age range. Im also due the week before next school year starts so my pregnancy doesnt affect my schooling. When I first found out, I was so scared and nervous, but loved my baby immediately. At 6 weeks I had an ultrasound and saw the little blob and I felt so much excitement, even though I knew I would never get to raise it. HOWEVER, the issue is, my partner does not want this child. In the beginning he told me I had to get an abortion and at 6 weeks when we made the appointment to go to Planned Parenthood, I couldnt take the first pill. I sobbed and sobbed and begged him to not make me do this and he did not care. We had many fights before that appointment and after that appointment where he told me Im an awful selfish person if I keep the child and how its not okay to gamble on a childs happiness, as it will be adopted by its biological grandmother and still have contact with its birth mother (me). Sorry this is kind of all over the place, but at 4 weeks I told him I was keeping it and so he yelled at me about how much he hated me then left.

No one else has to experience the physical pain, the risks, the emotional toll, or the lifelong consequences of giving birthso why should anyone else get to decide?

Some argue that a fetus has a right to life, but even if we grant that, no one has the right to use another persons body without consent. We dont force people to donate organs, even if it would save a life. If bodily autonomy applies to everyone else, why should it suddenly stop applying to pregnant people?

People get abortions for all kinds of reasonsfinancial instability, medical risks, being too young, not wanting to be a parent, or simply not wanting to be pregnant. And they shouldnt have to justify it. No one is obligated to give up their body for someone else, and pregnancy should be no exception.

I will be 38 weeks tomorrow and for a week straight as of today I have had a nonstop headache (I have not dealt with headache at any other point in this pregnancy) I have had Tylenol, tons and tons of water, I have Vistaril every night due to Prodromal Labor &amp; that doesn't help either, I also ended up in L&amp;D with strong contractions 2 minutes apart lasting a minute each yesterday (was a false alarm) and was given a Fioricet for my headache which also did not take the pain away, it's starting to drive me nuts at this point and I've already called my OB and I also told her at my last appointment and she is not concerned since my BP is just slightly elevated and not high (Ex. Doesn't go above 130/90) but regardless of if it's concerning I cannot keep dealing with pain like this for however many weeks are left, it very much effects my daily life, any of you who have dealt with bad headaches in the last trimester, what made them go away if anything, and is this a normal experience?

Im kinda nervous because my bump is absolutely huge and everyone asks if Im having twins.

My pre pregnancy weight was around 59kg and Im about 58. Im a fairly narrow or petite build. I went down to 56kg from nausea and vomiting at 9 weeks.

I was 74KG at 31 weeks and now Im 34 weeks(havent checked yet tbh too scared to)!! >u. So Ive gained about 15 kg from my pre pregnancy weight only at 31 weeks. The midwife didnt seem to think anything of it.

Bub was always measuring slightly big. First he was 75th percentile and then he rose up to the 85th by 27 weeks. Not sure what he will be now but they are checking next week.

Im already really struggling with walking and back issues. I actually needed crutches a few weeks ago from my SI joint popping out of place and Im still really struggling with back pain. 

Im wondering if any of you had a similar experience with weight gain and what the outcome was?

"2025-03-14",1741974066,"2 progesterone lab results from same day","Hi everyone, I'm not sure I chose the best fitting flair, just wanted to share a personal experience in case anyone ever wondered.

Last week, my NP ordered hcg and progesterone labs for me after I reported some spotting after a bowel movement (I already knew I was pregnant and was just waiting for the 1st OB appt at this time). My labs were drawn around 11am. Before the results came back, the NP said they were able to see me for a quick ultrasound as well, so I returned to the office. Thankfully the spotting was considered normal and they were able to detect fetal heartbeat. It turned into a ""confirmation of pregnancy"" visit so they ordered the pregnancy panel, which included another hcg and progesterone. These labs were drawn at 3pm on the same day.

By Monday, I got all the results back. My progesterone at 11am was 16, it went up to 23 by 3pm. I've read articles about progesterone fluctuating throughout the day and I figured this was a chance to see it in action. What's funny is I requested to be prescribed progesterone after seeing the 16 and maybe it's not necessary, but it still gives me some peace of mind.","pregnant",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jb9qdz/2_progesterone_lab_results_from_same_day/"
"2025-03-14",1741960587,"Kind of traumatizing doctors visit","Is this normal?

I went in for my regular 4 week visit yesterday at 22w4d. This was only my second visit at this office, since I moved mid-pregnancy. The nurse took my blood pressure and it was slightly elevated. I let them know that I do get nervous for visits (on top of that they rush you into the back, have you pee, weigh you, then try to have a full conversation with you and then take your blood pressure). My first visit at the office, 4 weeks ago, my blood pressure was elevated the first time they took it, I think like 150/80. After sitting there for about a minute, they retook it and it dropped to 132/82. I told them my normal blood pressure, before pregnancy was about 120/80. Yesterday, the first time they took it my BP was 153/87 and then they retook it about a minute later and it was 147/83. I know these are elevated blood pressures, but I did not expect what happened next. The midwife comes into the room, we've never met her before and met with a different midwife 4 weeks ago. The first thing she says to us is ""we're sending you to triage"". My husband and I had no idea what she meant, this is our first pregnancy. I honestly thought she was joking because of how cut and dry she said it. She then told me that my BP is so concerning and saying all of these things to me that are instantly terrifying me. We have had a completely healthy pregnancy so far, with zero complications, so this came as such a shock. She was so harsh about the way she was saying things. We had previously expressed that we wanted a natural birth in their birthing center, she starts telling us that this is all at risk and that we need to make sacrifices and ""that's just how parenthood is"". We were completely shocked and scared with the way that she was talking. She didn't even ask us if we have any questions or anything, just told us the directions to OB triage at the hospital. When we got to the hospital they took my blood and had me pee in a cup and explained that they would take my blood pressure every 15 minutes for 2 hours. They wanted to check for early markers of preeclampsia. We met the triage midwife who was much nicer and well spoken. When the 2 hours was up, they prescribed me a low dose of labetalol. All of my blood tests came back negative for preeclampsia. I have no protein in my pee. The only thing going on is an elevated blood pressure. 

I guess I just want to hear from others if this is a normal thing to be sent to triage for or if it seems like an over reaction from the midwife? Also am I completely screwed from having a natural birth? Am I going to get preeclampsia no matter what?? I feel like I left with so many questions and overall just so nervous and scared. What would've been a 30 minute doctors office turned into us at the doctors/ hospital for over 3 hours.

My previous two pregnancies were both so textbook-like: nausea and super crazy exhaustion starting in 1st trimester, both symptoms pretty much gone near the end of 1st trimester. Not much craziness for symptoms besides that. Both pregnancies previously were boys (now 3 &amp; 5 years old). The only main difference is that with my first pregnancy, my morning sickness wore off each day around dinner time (what a blessing!), but with my second pregnancy, I was pretty much just nauseous 24/7. =.=¨

But this pregnancy?? This pregnancy... I'm sometimes tired, sometimes EXHAUSTED, sometimes nauseous, random times of day it comes and goes, also random pains and cramps at different parts of my abdomen (mostly on the right but occasionally on the left) that also come and go...just...!? And earlier on it was lots of bloating and constipation and gas and sometimes also heartburn and now I also get bursts of mom rage but really I just feel SO all over the place. =

People I've talked to are like ""oh, it's a girl"" = which maybe it is since my boy pregnancies were both so similar and predictable but this one is so all over the place and unpredictable so far. I know you can't really predict that, but I can't help but laugh at how many people have said that to me?! Like, what?? Haha.

Also my sister had fraternal twins during her 3rd pregnancy and I'm 34 and in my 3rd pregnancy so I can't help but wonder if I'm having twins?! I'll find out next week at my first checkup (just 6 more days!) but it's definitely been on my mind.

Not looking for predictions or anything, mostly just wondering there are any other mamas out there who have had similar situations, with crazy symptoms all over the place?

About 3 days ago I found out I am pregnant &amp; had my blood drawn for the HCG, which the result was a number about 323. They also had done both types of ultrasounds and turns out I have two cysts on one of my ovaries, one is called a complex cystic lesion &amp; a Hemorrhagic cyst. Both measuring 2cm. 
Though, they did not see anything inside the uterus yet &amp; they say I could be about 2-3 weeks or so pregnant.

Has anyone had any issues with any cysts during early stages or mid stages of pregnancy? Should I be concerned about them &amp; how the number of HCG seems a little high for that estimated amount of time? Specially since they didnt see anything at all yet?

"2025-03-13",1741903662,"I peed myself today. Twice. The second time was while on a work call.","I started PT for incontinence over a month ago and have been making progress. I never had this problem with my first pregnancy, but luckily I work from home this time around so it's been easy to address issues when they come up. I'm 30 weeks and it's been going on since around 22+. Sneezing, laughing, suddenly standing from sitting at my desk for too long - nothing has been safe unless I've recently emptied. My husband has witnessed far too many instances of me sneezing or laughing, suddenly stopping all bodily movement, and waddling to the bathroom to change. We giggle every time, but damn has it been annoying. I make sure to pee every chance I get when we're out of the house. 

Cut to this morning. I took work off all of yesterday because I had to take our 2 yr old to the clinic for what turned out to be his first ear infection. None of us had slept more than 3 hours the night before and then I was running around trying to get him checked out and his prescription filled after hours waiting at the clinic to be seen. We also just got back from a family trip out of state last week which we all came back from with a bit of a cough. It all compounded and I woke up hacking, feeling so slow and weak, and just generally like s#!t. The cough is the worst part. So intense and painful when it comes on and I just have to ride it out while hoping I don't blackout from the effort of staying upright and not pissing myself. 

So I go to give my son his antibiotics before daycare and start a coughing fit that has me laid out on the living room carpet, red faced, wheezing, and despite my best efforts not to I peed myself. Quite a bit more than my usual sneeze slip, but not a full release. All the while my toddler is happily watching Octonauts and eating Cheerios, unfazed by his mother's demise happening inches from his chair at his little breakfast table. My husband is laughing at the admittedly hilarious scene while rubbing my back as I'm crying because I'm also laughing and have told him I just peed while also telling him to go f@&amp;k himself in between breaths. Only I get to laugh at me while I'm dying. At the end of this episode our son finally turns and asks ""Okay-k?"", his way of asking if I'm ok. (He does this whenever his dad or I cough, sneeze, trip, etc d). More tear-filled laughter as I collect myself from the floor and give him his medicine before the spell is broken and he refuses. I then go get changed and they go on their merry way to daycare and work. 

Later that morning I foolishly took a call instead of forwarding it to my coworker or waiting to hear the voicemail to see what needed doing. The woman of course has an involved issue that requires much back and forth and my voice is leaving me with every sentence, not to mention how many times I'm having to mute myself so I could cough without doing so in her ear. I finally get to a point where I need to loop in my coworker so she can take over. I stay on (muted) to hear out the situation and resolution. Just after it's over our supervisor checks in to see if she can help since she wasn't available to take the call originally. We loop her in for a catch up and I unmute. They of course know I'm pregnant and as I'm telling them about this morning my supervisor goes ""Oh no! And you're so far along! Was it hard to get up off the floor?"" I start laughing, which starts a rough coughing fit, and once again pee myself, this time so badly I need a shower. I stand there for a moment just staring at my leggings and the kitchen floor in bemusement and some disgust. I calmly unmute, simply answer I was able to get up with help, and excuse myself after their well-wishes and assurances that I do not need to take anymore calls today and to just forward them. 

I never thought my top reason to be thankful for WFH would be so I can piss myself without missing work. And yes, I did call my husband to catch him up on the fun he missed. If he brings me home adult diapers I honestly can't say if I will throw them at him or say thank you while flipping him off, but I wouldn't put it past him.

"2025-03-14",1741911316,"Today I had the most inappropriate, violating, dismissive, condescending care ever by an MFM who has never met me before."," WARNING  If you are near Long Island, NY and you ever have a pregnancy in which you need a referral to an MFM for possible high-risk factors, DO NOT EVER go to Cecilia Avila, part of Stony Brook Medicine. Every other doctor in this practice is wonderful. I got the bad egg this time due to bad timing and luck. 

Today I received the most inappropriate and VIOLATING care Ive ever received by a doctor (keep in mind this includes the team and surgeons that *misdiagnosed my appendicitis and left my appendix in by accident*, rendering me infertile and needing IVF in the first place. I wish I had looked up her reviews beforehand. Theyre dreadful. 

Today I was supposed to see an MFM one more time as a formality to make sure I can continue under the Midwives care for the remaining 1-4 weeks of my pregnancy and deliver with them. Thats not what happened. 

Would rate negative stars if I could. She came into the room without ever greeting me or introducing herself. Without ever having met me or reviewing my chart, told me she refuses to allow me back into the SBU midwives care although I have *no high-risk factors* at 36 weeks other than my age (45) and this being an IVF pregnancy. (The baby is in perfect health and is growing on schedule. I am in perfect health, BP is fine, no GD.)

She then told me my plan to go to 40 weeks is basically killing my baby, although Id already been cleared by another MFM in the practice to do exactly that with close monitoring. The statistics for placental issues after 39 weeks for IVF/older patients are in 17/1000 births as opposed to 11/1000 births in other pregnancies. Thats still only 1.7% vs 1.1% - yes, its 42% higher than younger natural pregnancies but LOOK AT THE NUMBERS. 

She went on a rant, speaking poorly of all of these IVF patients lately who dont want induction or to go before 40 weeks and want care other than MFM. Her opinion on IVF patients desire for the least invasive options that can *safely* be done was vile and simply& wrong. Im not a monster for wanting to be under the care of midwives that are still connected to the hospital system, particularly when an OB or MFM on call at the hospital can take over at any time if medically necessary. 

The icing on the cake was when she did a RECTAL SWAB INSERTION for Group B Strep with no forewarning of what she was about to do. I understand this can be part of the process, but a decent doctor would tell the patient what she was about to do first. Had I done this at my midwife appointment, the swab wouldve been self-administered and ONLY vaginal. Not even a hello, and she was shoving a Q-tip up my ass. 

Ive never been treated like this by any medical professional  in 45 years of life. She was dismissive, haughty, condescending, rude, and violating. She does not belong seeing patients. She should be a desk doctor only, reviewing paperwork or in a lab somewhere. Her knowledge of IVF pregnancies is outdated and shes not up on the current peer-reviewed science. She bases opinions on old information and is not interested in hearing new statistics. Checking her reviews, she has told patients to TMFR without doing any actual diagnostic testing!

An MFM sees patients who are high-risk and already frightened and anxious about their pregnancies and their babies health. To treat these patients with anything other than kind, gentle, compassionate care is negligent at best, and dangerous and detrimental to both mental and physical health.

Im not a Karen. I have never reported a doctor in all of the years Ive been alive. Ive seen MANY doctors. This is the first time I have ever been treated like this. I am filing a formal complaint with Patient Advocacy as well as the home office. I plan to contact the Board as well. It seems Im not the first patient who has had this experience - but I want to make sure I am the last. No one should ever be told theyre killing their baby or have an invasive test without warning. 

I honestly have no idea who will be handling my pregnancy here on out, and its so jarring. I was almost at the finish line.

Anyways I had my second baby last year (2 under 2) and one of the most disheartening things has been my teeth.

I would grind my teeth at night, threw up at any time especially early morning, and I couldnt stomach tooth paste. I couldnt take my prenatal either because even after trying 7 different brands I would vomit to the point of bleeding after taking them. Which means my babies took the calcium they needed from me. On top of everything I was so depressed that I barely cared once I noticed my teeth literally cracking (was speaking out pieces of teeth). With this combination my teeth were destroyed with the latest being pulled last month. I hate to smile now because my teeth have cracks, chips, and holes in most of my teeth.

I'm worried my bf will hate me for saying that, but I've said since we met, I didn't want kids.  This pregnancy was not planned, and he's the ""God gave us this kid for a reason"" type of guy.

"2025-03-14",1741929853,"Positive Elective Induction Story","I thought Id share in case anyone was interested in hearing a positive elective induction story.

I asked for an elective induction on my due date for my second pregnancy. I actually drove myself to the hospital and begged to be induced ha. They agreed (I guess labor and delivery was slow that day.) We tried a membrane sweep the week prior and nothing. I was just done being pregnant, I had a rough and painful (had to start leave from work a month earlier than expected because my hip pain was so bad I could barely walk) third trimester. Pregnancy was otherwise really healthy/ uncomplicated. Ive had one previous vaginal delivery (spontaneous labor at 39 weeks after membrane sweep). Relatively uncomplicated hospital birth (20hrs in labor, 30min pushing, second degree tear, normal recovery. I did have terrible back labor though but once I got the epidural I felt nothing).

My husband met me at the hospital and we had lunch and then walked over to L&amp;D. We got checked in and found out I was already 5cm dilated. Got started in pitocin and started having contractions. I BARELY felt the contractions though they felt like mild period cramps but could see them in the monitor. My husband and I happily hung out and watched tv for three hours (we joked it was the first date wed been on in months ha). 

After a few hours the contractions started to hurt a but more so I asked for an epidural. By the time i got the epidural they were pretty painful but i was able to breathe through it all. Epidural worked and dulled the pain a bit (not as strong as the one id had with my first delivery). Nurse checked my cervix (7cm now) and accidentally broke my water. 

I IMMEDIATELY felt the need to push/ excruciating pressure. She checked me again, lo and behold I was at 10cm. 

I pushed like 4 times and my healthy baby girl was born 8 minutes later. The midwife barely had time to get to the room. I didnt tear at all! They removed the epidural and I basically felt totally normal& 

Shockingly easy recovery, was out to lunch with friends a few days later& 

It felt like the epidural didnt work below my belly but honestly the pushing part was so fast it was fine. I also wonder if I didnt tear because I could feel everything& Anyways, I hope any future birth I may have goes exactly like this again.

They've been getting better in my 2nd trimester, however, I have a coworker who irritates theeee shiiiiit out of me. She's actually SO NICE, but she reeks of ""desperation""... I can't think of a different or better word... of wanting to ""fit in"" &amp; be a part of every conversation... its irritating.. we are at work, I'm inquiring about something work related &amp; she manages to squeeze in a comment regarding something outside of work.. just to say it... or just to have an interaction.. and the bosses have new rules now &amp; she sarcastically brings them up, OFTEN. Like okay, jokes old already &amp; I don't want to fake laugh, just bc i feel bad.. also, she was calling my baby ""peanie"" the entire first trimester.. just a horrid nickname..not cute..and in the sonogram, baby didn't even LOOK like a peanut.. if it did, call it peanut.. not peanie... bc wth is that? I asked her to stop. My aunt also called it peanut.. I literally asked, ""where does it look like a peanut?"" ... its annoying as shit.

Anyway, back to coworker (who I've known since hs.. we are in our mid 30s now)

Examples:
1. How's peanie? Idk...... good, I hope!
2. Go eat, you're eating for two now.... no, I'm not.. and I don't eat unless I feel hungry or it's been a while since I've eaten. Even so, just bc I feel a slight twinge of hunger, doesn't mean I have to go stuff my face.
3. When im walking away from my work station, ""don't forget to clock out &amp; not waste company time.. or you'll get fired"" (jokes old already! .) - ""don't forget to clock out before you use the bathroom"" - all sarcastic joking comments, and only she's laughing.. legit laughing.. and im like.. this isn't even funny to me.. enough already.. 
4. Talking about work related shit &amp; she wants to throw in, ""we need a girl day"" . . . Or some personal stressful detail about her life, COMPLETELY irrelevant from the work related shit im talking about.. not even a conversation starter, just legit one sentence. One comment. Just to say it.
5. Talking about food and how hungry she is ALL THE TIME and then comments about how good the food was or how bad it messed up her belly.. comments on it FOR HOURS throughout the workday.. I've turned into a ""that's crazy"" person.... &amp; a ""don't make eye contact"" person, otherwise, she's blurting out ""those empanadas were so good.. I want more"" ..... SO GET THEM! It's like why do you have to say something every single time i face your direction? Like idc!
6. I had a browning banana on my desk and she tells me, ""you better eat that before it goes bad.."" - I said i will if I want it, but if it goes bad, I'll toss it. I'm not afraid to throw food away if i need to.. I'm not a food hoarder and I don't eat every single moment I'm hungry or just bc food is in front of me. 
7. She thinks just bc I'm pregnant I'm supposed to be eating like a cow... I was telling her something about me and my bf eating and she inquires about my bf, ""he eats as much as you?""  - B%#$* !! first of all, I'm not heavy. I love my body, I think I'm pretty =% hot, &amp; I feel good about myself in a world where what we see online can make us feel like pure shit. Even if i was heavy, juicy,.... a voluptuous woman.. id still feel sexy. however, I do not look like I overeat.. at all. So that comment implies that just bc I'm expecting, I eat more than my 5""11 190lb weight lifting BF !? I can barely eat with all of my food aversions. I'm 5'3, always bloated in belly (prior to pregnancy) due to PCOS.. but to say that shit...  my blood boiled. The assumptions are crazy annoying. Just bc im pregnant, you're simply going to assume i cant control my food intake. Wth. 
8. She suffers from anxiety, I'm someone who worries here and there, has fears, like anyone else... especially as a FTM and possible complications etc. I was so nervous in the beginning of this pregnancy... and so she would make comments like, ""people like us"" or ""you know how our mind works"" ... associating me with an anxiety disorder. It's like she took my valid ass fears or worries.. and moments* of anxiety... to compare to HER &amp; associates with anxiety
9. Tells my worker (who trusts my pallet) that as long as she sits next to me, she's going to gain weight. (Again, not bc I'm heavy.. she just think bc I'm pregnant, I eat like a savage) mind you I have 2 meals a day bc so many food thoughts turn me off.) You're not about to blame me for my food recommendations*** &amp; if someone chooses to eat it.. and gains weight, ""blame her"" .. you're not cute or funny. Bc what you're saying isn't even true! If it were true, it wouldn't bother me.

All this shit IRKS me &amp; I can't control the annoyed feelings.

In your experience, is it worth it, does it increase stress and costs unnecessarily, and does it push for interventions that aren't needed/scans that end up getting false positives? 

I'm labeled high risk at 39 as a FTM who conceived through IVF (unexplained, but very likely cervical issues). I agreed to MFM care in my first trimester because I was struggling with anxiety and happy for any additional assuring appointments. But at 22 weeks, anxiety is gone and everything is going perfectly with me and baby. I have a baby echocardiogram scheduled for 3 weeks from now, and apparently I'd start to see MFM every 2 weeks (!!) not long after that, in addition to all my OB appointments. 

I spoke with my normal GP today, who specializes in women's reproductive health, and she strongly recommended I consider bowing out of MFM care. This is given my zero indicated risk and the high likelihood that they would induce me (they told me they'd induce me before my due date) and overall push for scans and tests that often give false positives. 

She said MFM really pushes for babies to be born alive and early (pushing induction) vs. thinking about the baby's overall start in life (being able to nurse, breathe well, fight infection, etc). She sees the difference in newborn response and overall health whereas MFM and OB don't treat babies after birth, and the differences she sees between babies born 36-39 weeks vs. 40-41 weeks (especially for healthy women who eat, move, and have supportive communities) is huge. 

It's got me thinking! Anyone else avoid MFM or even extra OB intervention to avoid induction or being pressured toward induction (or just lots of expensive appointments/scans that aren't needed)?

If I disclose my pregnancy now, I can qualify for Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA) accommodations, which would help reduce stress, that would be good for both me and the baby.

The downside is that Im only 8 weeks along and at high risk for miscarriage due to my rare double uterus condition. I dont want to deal with other peoples emotions if that happens.

When did you tell and what do you think I should do?

Im not making excuses for myself but am wrecked with guilt about how difficult it was for me to quit weed altogether out of the fear of withdrawals. 

I found out at 5 weeks and immediately stopped smoking - HOWEVER, the absolute torture that is insomnia from weed withdrawals is one of my greater fears (from past quitting experiences) so I bought low concentration THC pills from a dispensary. 

From weeks 5-10 I tapered from 10mg pills to 2mg and stopped from there. My tolerance was so jacked up that 10mg did nothing for me so to be clear I have never been high while pregnant I was honest to god just terrified of the sleepless nights &amp; my ability to function at my full time job (where if you make mistakes its a very big deal). 

This pregnancy was so not planned and I feel so fucking guilty and concerned that I was selfish enough to not just suffer through however many sleepless nights I needed to to safeguard this babys development. 

It doesnt help that so many people tell me I know all kinds of women who smoked through their pregnancy and their kids turned out fine!!! They been said their doctors even recommended it&. Really doubt the latter and you dont know the impact on brain development right off the bat, you just dont know.

"2025-03-13",1741899475,"Newly pregnant after TTC for a year, an ectopic, and diagnosed infertility","I guess I need somewhere to spill my news of excitement and anxiety. 

My husband and I decided to TTC last year this month and we got pregnant in July, only for it to end with an ectopic pregnancy rupturing and I lost my right fallopian tube. I was diagnosed with stage 3 endometriosis during this surgery (which I never knew I had) and it had eaten through my entire fallopian tube, causing the ectopic. It was covering my ovaries and all over my insides. After my ectopic, we continued TTC with times sex and using LH strips and BBT monitoring. 

After my ectopic, I started having really short luteal phases (7-8 days) several months in a row. After pushing my OBGYN, they finally decided to run CD21 progesterone labs and discovered that my progesterone was too low to confirm ovulation each month. They tested me three months in a row and confirmed I had stopped ovulating on my own. That combined with my stage 3 endo diagnosis, I was diagnosed with infertility. 

In January, they did an endometriosis excision surgery and found that my other tube was completely clear (yay!). They ran progesterone labs again the following month and I still was not ovulating. They decided to put me on Letrozole 5mg. 

I hit one year TTC this month and my husband and I took a trip to France. I didnt have my hopes high because Im so used to disappointment and seeing negatives, but the night I got home, on 10DPO, I got a positive. 

I immediately took a digital and it came back positive too. I cant believe my first cycle on 5mg Letrozole actually worked!! I am cautiously excited because the protocol following an ectopic is to get bloodwork every 48 hours until I can get a 6 week placement scan to ensure it is not ectopic again. I have started my bloodwork and my 6 week appointment is scheduled. 

I am terrified of losing this baby that we have tried for for so long. I am waiting for the other shoe to drop and I cant help but feel terrified that this baby wont make it, despite really healthy first bloodwork.

Im currently 9 weeks and 4 days pregnant with my first baby. After my first prenatal appointment, I received unexpected news from my employer that we need to return to the office after nearly three years of working remotely. I was devastated because I had hoped to work from home during my pregnancy and through my babys first year, but here we are.

I spoke with my doctor about it, and she gave me some great advice to make the transition easier, like treating myself to lunch nearby, listening to my favorite podcast on the commute, and finding small ways to make the experience more pleasant. That helped me mentally prepare, but Im still struggling with first-trimester fatigue, sleepiness, food aversions, and all the fun symptoms that come with early pregnancy. I have been told things get better in the second trimester, so Im hopeful.

Now, I have the option to work either:

* 5 days a week, 8 hours a day
* 4 days a week, 10 hours a day with 3-day weekends

I would love to hear from others who have worked a flex schedule while pregnant. For context, I'm a software developer. My commute would be 45 - 60 minutes.

Id never thought about it too deeply before but it hit me a bit today that one way or another that tomorrow we will know for sure what our family will be and thats a bit overwhelming. Having never found out in pregnancy before I didnt realise how utterly nerve wrecking it is! I cant think about anything else, please tell me Im not the only one!

Im 57 and my comfortable weight when Im eating well and working out is around 135 (Im small framed and dont carry much muscle, so this is not too thin on me). The constant hormones and stress of IVF bumped me up to 145 prior to this pregnancy. 

Now Im fresh into the second trimester and have already gained another 10 pounds. As of this morning, Im 155. My appetite has definitely increased and Im not depriving myself.

My arms, hips, thighs, and boobs have already grown a lot too. None of my clothes fit me right now and nothing I try on makes me feel good.

At 6 weeks pregnant I had a gush of blood, a bit like a period with clots and was diagnosed with a small hematoma in the ER and low fetal heart rate. After I had on and off bleeding with clots occasionally until my 10th week of pregnancy. On my tenth week I had bleed out all of the hematoma (rushed to the ER scared again). The heart rate is now normal. 


My first OBGYN told me over the phone based on the picture I sent him of the bleeding I was miscarrying and there was no point of going to the ER as I already did a scan early due to spotting and it was not ectopic. He was wrong. Usually these hematomas have no symptoms or mild cramping and resemble a miscarriage. Please dont be scared and remember that it is not in your control or your fault. If you are diagnosed with one drink lots of water and take your vitamins.

My boyfriend (22) and I (25) always said that if an ""oops"" happened, abortion would be the planbut we also acknowledged that you never truly know how youll feel until you're in that situation. And now, here we are.

I finish my nursing degree in December, have a steady job managing social media (which isnt hard to do and pays well), and were planning to move to Florida next summer. My boyfriend still has at least 3-4 years left of school (he's studying to be a chiropractor or physical therapist), and while he wants to be a dad one day, he admits now is not ideal. That said, he has made it clear that its ultimately my choice, since its my body.

I am pro-choice, but the thought of going through an abortion puts me in such a dark place mentally that I genuinely dont think I could survive it. Its not that I feel ""ready"" to be a mombecause who ever really is?but I just cant see myself going through the process of an abortion. His mom initially said its my decision, but she supports abortion and even called me to basically push for it. My boyfriend, while not pressuring me, also knows keeping the baby isnt what he would have chosen.

I know having a baby right now would make things a lot harder, especially with our move coming up. But I also know I *can* do it. My job is remote, and Ill still be able to work once we move. Plus, Ive always dreamed of being a momliterally forever. I want to be a pediatric or NiCU nurse, and once we move, I plan to find a job in either PEDS or NICU nursing while continuing to work remotely. Having a baby while finishing school wasnt part of the plan, but its not impossible.

Whats weighing on me is knowing that this wouldnt be his choice, and that his mom has already made it clear where she stands. He also told me that if we keep the baby, he probably wouldnt be able to work while studying, and he wants to be able to give the baby everything. I dont want to ruin his future, but I also feel like Id be ruining myself if I went through with an abortion.

Our relationship is so full of love, and the idea of ending this pregnancy when we are happy together *hurts*. It haunts me. I just dont know what to do.

I see a ton of posts about inductions being pushed for suspected large babies but not small, so I wanted to initiate the conversation and see if anyone has experience with this. I have had a totally normal healthy pregnancy so far, 31 years old pregnant with my first baby (a baby boy!) and underwent a routine 36 week US at my office (in retrospect I wish I declined this but you live and you learn) which showed that my baby's estimated fetal weight is 9th percentile, which is technically ""fetal growth restriction"". Of note he measured 24th percentile at prior ultrasound at 28 weeks. I have a repeat growth scan at 38 weeks 3 days and if he is still 9th percentile my OB is recommended induction between 38 to 39 weeks. I have had BPPs and dopplers to check blood flow which have all been totally normal, and I have a gut feeling that this is all seriously overkill. Also of note I was a small baby (6lb4oz at birth) and my husband and I are not big people (115lb pre pregnancy, husband is 150lb), and I have only gained 20-25 lbs during pregnancy. I am praying that he is 10th percentile or above at the growth scan so this is all a moot point, but if he does remain 9th percentile I am really inclined to decline induction if everything else remains stable as to not open the can of worms for cascade of intervention, but of course my first priority is baby's safety and would never want to put him at risk in doing so.

"2025-03-14",1741912716,"Pregnant to my ex","So I found out I was pregnant about a week after my ex broke up with me.  I use the term ex very loosely as we had only been together about 3 months.
I told him I was pregnant and was keeping the baby, I have a decent paying job and expected to have a good support network around. It was his choice if he wanted to be involved. He said he would support my decision and be there for me. 

Fast forward to now Im currently 16 weeks pregnant, I have a few friends that are supportive (but have their own lives)and baby dad who was doing what he could until the past couple weeks. My family have said Im being selfish (very old fashioned and think Im crazy doing it alone) and havent been supportive at all. I have basically cut them out at this point. 

I was heavily relying on my ex for both emotional support but also just to make me feel less lonely. Its not been an easy pregnancy so far and Im high risk, Ive had to have him come over a few times at the advice of midwives. I know he has his own life to lead and hes said himself he cant be there 24/7 but does want to be involved, then backed off about 2/3 weeks ago. I have reached out but was brushed off, again it was a me problem, but if Im not healthy then baby isnt safe. He has been there when the midwives have advised me to take it easy and knows how high risk I am. I have been signed off work too. How much is too much to expect ?  Im really struggling both physically and mentally with the pregnancy. I also want to build a friendship with him so we can coparent to the best of our ability. I want to be comfortable around him for the birth but also afterwards. I dont think Ill want a practical stranger around me when Im in labour or even in the weeks/months following the birth. 
The fact he is aware that hes the only person I really have right now but is stepping away is also making me think will he do this to the baby.  Can I really trust him to be the best dad. I just want to build a friendship now, maybe initially I thought we could work on us but not now. 

For reference were late 30s early 40s he already has older children (young adults) this is my first but had previous miscarriages. I am financially stable enough to do it alone but just struggling with everything and him having stepped back Im feeling completely isolated. As I said I do have friends I can rely on but they have their own lives (jobs/kids/families etc)

Is it unreasonable to expect baby dad to be involved with me throughout the pregnancy?  Am I expecting too much to build a friendship or even expect him to support me right now?  I dont feel comfortable having him at the appts now or even asking for support when I had a scare. Baby seems to be ok its me thats not doing great. 

We got into a huge fight when I told him that I didnt want him to come along to my next appt and that from now on I was going to do it alone. I would just inform him of updates if there was issues.  That if he couldnt offer the support I needed then we would have to reassess his coming along and also the birth and beyond. I would honestly rather be alone than have him around right now. He just said theres no reason for us to be friends but he does want to know and be there for appts. He isnt getting my view that its my body and if I feel like he will be a stranger then it will be me who decides when he can visit and when he can attend the appts or hospital after birth. 

Maybe I was being too needy, maybe I was expecting too much.  But when I discovered I was pregnant I wasnt expecting to have this emotional turmoil, or to have such a high risk pregnancy. But I also feel he should have been clearer from the start about his boundaries. ","pregnant",2,"https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jargtm/pregnant_to_my_ex/"

But at my last appointment with my OB, she didn't want to schedule an induction and wanted to discuss it later (this was at 37 weeks) I missed my 38 week appointment due to oversleeping and I missed my 39 week appointment which was yesterday due to the fact that I was having contractions and believed I was going into labor so I spent the time that should've been my appointment, at the hospital being evaluated for the contractions. The contractions stopped. So, it was false labor I guess. 

My next appointment is on the 19th but my doctor will be out of office and I'm meeting with her nurse instead. 

But I can't take this anymore. I just want relief. I'm sick of working while heavily pregnant. I just want to have my baby and start my leave.

Ill get straight to the point, me and my gf are expecting our little girl in May and I could not be anymore excited to be a girl dad! She is currently 7 months so its getting closer. 

Tonight we had a bad argument. My gf has been sooooo clingy to the point its suffocating me. I dont understand and never will understand pregnancy, all I could do is research but Ill never understand what it feels like. I applause all you women who sacrifice your bodies for our children.

Shes been so clingy up the point where if I wanna go to the gym, take care of errands, or go with my family, she gets upset. I tell her to go with me but the days she doesnt feel like doing anything, she stays and complains. Ive been going to the gym and dropping weight and feeling better and I work pretty much everyday because Im trying to save up for a new house for all three of us. Its non stop with me, Im always working just to save money and grind for us. 

Tonight, she started ranting to me that Im never there for her or she feels alone. Ive heard it before and I step up and when she asks me to massage her feet, back, shoulders, etc I do it with no complaints. I always check on her when Im at work and always asks if she needs anything before I get home. She once again, said that she feels like Im not affectionate when all I do is care for her. She literally thanked me the other day and said she appreciates me everyday because Im so good to her but tonight I hit a boiling point..

I regret it and said some ugly things because she started saying ugly things to me and absolutely HATE yelling especially since our little girl can hear now. But I feel soooo unappreciated when she complains about me daily and when Im doing the best I can for her.. and for us.. we never really fight but its just built up and built up to the point where I got mad tonight. She left and went to go stay with her sister. Another thing i talked to her about was keeping our business private. The last fight we had she went and told her mom& like we have these arguments but I never go and run and tell my parents.. its so frustrating. I love her and thank her everyday for carrying our little girl but I feel like she doesnt see how HARD Im trying for us.

Its been so frustrating for me to navigate high stress emotions during pregnancy. I've always been a sensitive and emotional person, but I had a good system of taking space, smoking a hot of weed and letting it chill my mind so I could process and work through my emotions. just having the control to be able to change how I was feeling in an instant was so helpful in breaking my emotional spiraling and allowing myself to regulate. now I feel frustrated because I don't know how to cope. I try breathing, I try walking, I even try screaming into a pillow, but nothing helps to reduce the feelings and I feel so helpless now. I also get frustrated because there are so many things I've had to give up while my partner doesn't have to and I can't help but feel childish and resentful that I have to give everything up and feel nauseous and exhausted and extra emotional and then I get frustrated with myself for feeling like that because that's not who I want to be. I feel so trapped and limited and I know it's temporary, but it's so so hard on those moments. 

so I'm wondering, if anyone else feels like this, how do they navigate it?

"2025-03-14",1741922336,"im 5w and feeling so confused","this is my first pregnancy and prior to this i had it in my head that i probably couldnt get pregnant (i know many of us think this and are proven wrong lol). i cant stop the overthinking and its driving me crazy, i started experiencing some spotting a couple days ago that was just some light pink discharge that got a little darker through the day but i wasnt quite concerned yet, the next morning however after having sex with my partner i noticed it was a bit darker in color and i also had a bit of tissue..i know sex can cause some irritation but the tissue had me the most concerned.
i decided to call my dr and went in and got testing done and my hcg was at 7,204 and they wanted me to come in asap for an ultrasound today, fast forward to the ultrasound we only could see the gestational and yolk sacs and i was told its probably because im so early but i cant stop thinking about how others have had no issues seeing baby even if it is tiny and why if my levels were so high that they wanted to do an ultrasound can we not see it? i have another ultrasound scheduled in two weeks but ive had some more cramping since all the testing began and the spotting has now gone from light pink to red, im trying not to freak myself out but i also have been feeling like all of my symptoms that i was feeling so strongly last week have gone away except for soreness in my boobs. is this normal? like i said this is my first and after being so convinced i wasnt going to be able to have kids i just cant get myself out of the rabbit hole ive created of overthinking.

For context, I was married for 8 years and we have 2 amazing kids(8 year old daughter, 4 year old son). The marriage had many issues including infidelity on his end and the divorce was not very amicable at first, but were co parenting fine for the most part now. I met my current partner 3 years ago a few months after my divorce, and weve been dating for 2 years. He is the most amazing and supportive man Ive ever met. He has only met my kids once at a family event a few months ago and he was introduced as a friend of the family. Now Im pregnant and am worried about how to tell them and how this new baby can affect them. They e had a lot of change in the past 3 years including moving twice, financial  issues (although I dont think they noticed that), not having a set schedule for whos watching then throughout the week etc. I was not in a great headspace for the first year after the divorce and unfortunately was drinking way too much and ended up getting a DUI (they are obviously unaware of this). We all began individual therapy kids included after the dui and It felt like our lives were finally in a stable, healthy, happy place. Everything felt calm and normal, now Im scared about how this pregnancy will affect them. Im almost at the 4 month mark and am starting to show, but I am really unsure of how to tell the kids without them feeling overwhelmed. My daughter in particular had a really rough time with the divorce and still struggles. We are planning on having him move in with us once baby is born so its not too much change at once, then moving into a house together once we get into the swing of things.

This will be my first pregnancy, so I'm a bit new to all of this. I also wasn't tracking ovulation since we weren't officially trying to conceive, so I had to try to do some backwards calculation. I've read that doubling is important for viability, but is an hcg of 975 at 17 DPO considered high? 

The scales for HCG have such wide ranges, and obviously everyone is different, but what do we think? I'm cautiously excited to be potentially having a baby either way, I've just become sort of fixated on the numbers of it all since I won't be going for my first appointment for another few weeks.

"2025-03-13",1741906020,"Thinking of doing a C section. Traumatized from my last birth.","I don't know if I really need advice or not.   
I plan on talking to my doctor tomorrow but I am struggling with my anxiety. 

I am currently 20w along with my second pregnancy. 

I first was great till the birth. Had him at 39+4 and he was semi big at 8lb 1oz. He also was sunny side up (nose facing my pelvis vs nose facing tail bone like normal) And for anyone that doesn't know that means that the widest part of the baby head is coming out first instead of the cone part of the head which is made to come out first. 

Him being born in that position caused me to tear in 3 locations all needing stitches and all VERY painful. I had the Epidural for my labor which also was a very long process for me as well but it only semi worked. i could feel contraction pain in my tail bone and my left butt cheek... they of course turned it off for the pushing part which lasted 2 1/2 hours for me. 

During my birth i was crying and saying i couldn't handle it anymore, i was in so much pain i wanted to quit. which i technically did as i stopped pushing myself though my body still naturally pushed and they had to help pull him out of me once his head came out. 

I feel as though I'm sort of traumatized and I'm having so much anxiety about giving birth again. I've told my husband that I am considering a C section as the cons of a c section sound way more worth it to me than going through a 24 hour labor, and 2+ plus hours of pushing and feeling like I'm giving up. 

I am aware a C section has a several month healing process, I'm aware of how the procedure works. What I maybe want is hearing other peoples experience. Did you choose to do a C section after a birth that scared you? what did you do to help with the anxiety of going through that pain again?

"2025-03-14",1741941564,"Abortion Is Okay Because Its Their Choice","At the end of the day, abortion is a personal decision, and no one should be forced to stay pregnant against their will. Pregnancy is a major medical event that affects a persons body, health, future, and life in ways that only they can fully understand. No one else has to experience the physical pain, the risks, the emotional toll, or the lifelong consequences of giving birthso why should anyone else get to decide?

Some argue that a fetus has a right to life, but even if we grant that, no one has the right to use another persons body without consent. We dont force people to donate organs, even if it would save a life. If bodily autonomy applies to everyone else, why should it suddenly stop applying to pregnant people?

People get abortions for all kinds of reasonsfinancial instability, medical risks, being too young, not wanting to be a parent, or simply not wanting to be pregnant. And they shouldnt have to justify it. No one is obligated to give up their body for someone else, and pregnancy should be no exception.

If someone believes abortion is wrong, they dont have to get one. But forcing others to stay pregnant against their will is not about valuing lifeits about controlling peoples bodies.","Abortiondebate",221,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jazbb9/abortion_is_okay_because_its_their_choice/"
